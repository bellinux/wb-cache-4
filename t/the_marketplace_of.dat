5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> the Bucharest {{neighborhood}} Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety. However, the production benefited from its picturesque view, rendering the scenography and the original music unnecessary.

5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting {{that she is a}} witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{science fiction}} {{has been marked}} by the spread of {{cyberpunk}} to other parts of <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> ideas.

25|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} {{geographic}} media markets. Media enterprises operate in specific geographic markets. Some firms {{operate in a}} national market while other companies, for example, local radio stations operate in a regional area. So <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> a media enterprise consists of the product media markets (consumer market, advertisement market and procurement market) and the geographic media market.|$|E

25|$|During the Wars of Religion, the governor, who was Protestant was massacred {{with his}} family, by the people. In 1568, François Cocqueville, a Protestant leader of war, entered the Ponthieu with 3,000 soldiers. He plundered and sacked the , towns, churches and castles of Authie and Saint-Valery-sur-Somme region. Chased by the , Cocqueville was {{captured}} {{with several of}} his own and they were beheaded on <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Abbeville.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Angkor {{contained}} no permanent buildings; {{it was an}} open square where the traders sat on the ground on woven straw mats and sold their wares. There were no tables or chairs. Some traders might be protected from the sun with a simple thatched parasol. A certain type of tax or rent was levied by officials for each space occupied by traders in the marketplace. The trade and economy in the Angkor marketplace were mainly run by women.|$|E
25|$|In 1456, Ottoman troops under Hizir Pasha {{assaulted}} Trebizond. According to Laonikos Chalkokondyles, Hizir {{raided the}} countryside, even penetrating into <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Trebizond and capturing altogether about two thousand people. The city was deserted due to plague {{and likely to}} fall; John made his submission and agreed to pay an annual tribute of 2,000 gold pieces in return for Hizir freeing the captives he had taken. John sent his brother David to ratify the treaty with Mehmed II himself, which he did in 1458, but the Sultan raised the tribute to 3,000 gold pieces.|$|E
5000|$|A tron was a {{weighing}} beam {{in medieval}} Scotland, usually located in <b>the</b> <b>marketplaces</b> <b>of</b> burghs. There are various roads and buildings in several Scottish towns that are {{named after the}} tron. For example, Trongate in Glasgow and Tron Kirk in Edinburgh. Etymologically the word {{is derived from the}} Old French tronel or troneau, meaning [...] "balance".|$|R

25|$|The {{location}} of the fortress used to be <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> the Vehkalahti, which had received city rights in 1653 {{under the name of}} Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki. The city was destroyed in the Great Northern War in 1712. The construction of the fortress began by Swedish general Axel von Löwen after the Treaty of Nystadt in early 1720s. Von Löwen wanted to prevent the Russian advance into the Gulf of Finland as envisioned by the Tsar Peter the Great, who wanted to open the sea routes for Russia. Alongside the Hamina fortress the construction of another fortress also began in Lappeenranta.|$|E
25|$|Whenever {{the time}} arrives for a spirit {{to return to}} Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the {{conception}} of {{a new life in}} the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so {{in the form of a}} Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to <b>The</b> <b>Marketplace</b> <b>of</b> one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.|$|E
25|$|Things {{turned out}} {{slightly}} otherwise in Aragon, where the sociolinguistic situation was different, with a clearer Basque-Romance bilingual situation (cf. Basques from the Val d'Aran cited c. 1000), but a receding Basque language (Basque banned in <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Huesca, 1349). While the language {{was chosen as}} a medium of prestige in records and official statements along with Latin in the early 13th century, Occitan faced competition from the rising local Romance vernacular, the Navarro-Aragonese, both orally and in writing, especially after Aragon's territorial conquests south to Zaragoza, Huesca and Tudela between 1118 and 1134. It resulted that a second Occitan immigration of this period was assimilated by the similar Navarro-Aragonese language, which {{at the same time}} was fostered and chosen by the kings of Aragon. The language fell into decay in the 14th century across the whole southern Pyrenean area and became largely absorbed into Navarro-Aragonese first and Castilian later in the 15th century, after their exclusive boroughs broke up (1423, Pamplona's boroughs unified).|$|E

25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) relates {{how that}} Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, a priest of Aaron’s lineage, {{and others with}} him, used to go down into <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> the Saracens in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse {{themselves}} in order to eat their bread (Terumah) {{in a state of}} ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi Ishmael ben Jose and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon – though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile – was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city. Therefore, taking as an exemplum the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of cleanness over the city’s air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without harboring feelings of guilt or fear of contracting uncleanness.|$|E
25|$|In 1197 {{the most}} serious {{challenge}} to Sverre's kingdom arose. Several prominent opponents of Sverre, including Bishop Nikolas Arnesson of Oslo, who was a half-brother of King Inge Crouchback and archbishop Eirik Ivarsson. met at <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Halör in Skåne, then part of Denmark. They took a boy called Inge Magnusson, purported son of King Magnus Erlingsson as their figurehead-king. Their party was called the Bagler, from an old Norse word meaning crosier. The war between the Bagler, with the open support of the Church, and the birkebeiner was to last {{for the rest of}} Sverre's reign. They were not able to depose Sverre, but neither was he able to win a decisive victory against them. When Sverre died from disease in Bergen in 1202, he was the first king of Norway to die of natural causes since King Sigurd the Crusader in 1130. His last act was to advise his son and heir, Håkon Sverresson, to achieve a settlement with the Church. Håkon was taken to be the Birkbeiner's new king, and the bishops returned to Norway later the same year, releasing the country from the interdict. Deprived of most of his support, the Bagler King Inge was killed the same year.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} were {{praised for}} their depth and detail, although reviewers noted {{they were not}} always the best the console had to offer. Game Revolution noted the characters' faces, the [...] "toughest graphical challenge on 3D characters", saying that the characters' expressions and animation featured [...] "surprising grace". IGN believed that Ocarina of Time improved on the graphics of Super Mario 64, giving a larger sense of scale. Impressive draw distances and large boss characters were also mentioned as graphical highlights. Although excelling {{in the use of}} color and the visibility and detail of the environment, reviewers noted that some graphical elements of Ocarina of Time did not perform as well as Banjo-Kazooie, a game released for the same platform earlier that year. IGN said that the frame rate and textures of Ocarina of Time were not as good as those of Banjo-Kazooie, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> Hyrule Castle, which was called [...] "blurry".|$|E

500|$|Beginning in late 2002, Gore {{began to}} {{publicly}} criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23, 2002, speech given before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized President George W. Bush and Congress for {{the rush to}} war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, [...] "Back in 1991, I {{was one of a}} handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion." [...] In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called [...] "religious zealots" [...] who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: [...] "They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith." [...] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, [...] "Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong [...] I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country." [...] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the [...] "emptying out of <b>the</b> <b>marketplace</b> <b>of</b> ideas" [...] in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately [...] "redeem the integrity of representative democracy." [...] In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, [...] "I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage." [...] In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: [...] "I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy [...] You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all." ...|$|E
