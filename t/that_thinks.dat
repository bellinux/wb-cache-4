Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing <b>that</b> <b>thinks,</b> excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E

The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: [...] "More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf." [...] After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including [...] "Write me a creature <b>that</b> <b>thinks</b> as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.|$|E

[...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible thing she could have done, because she thinks it means something but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was [...] "just sex", adding that [...] "it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy [...] "Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club <b>that</b> <b>thinks</b> it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E

500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group <b>that</b> <b>thinks</b> along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the issues. I knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E
500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force <b>that</b> <b>thinks</b> it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E

[...] David Edelstein, Slates film critic, dubbed the film [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie — The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre — <b>that</b> <b>thinks</b> it's an act of faith", and further criticized Gibson for focusing on the brutality of Jesus' execution, instead of his religious teachings.|$|E
