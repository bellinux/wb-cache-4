2500|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Rams tight end David Hill lost a fumble {{due to a}} hit by Monte Coleman. Linebacker Neal Olkewicz {{recovered}} the ball and returned 19 yards to Rams 30-yard line, setting up Atkinson's 20-yard field goal. Hill's fumble was confirmed by a replay review that lasted nearly five minutes, prompting Redskins safety Curtis Jordan to declare [...] "I thought <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in touch with Oliver North." [...] This {{was the first time}} in NFL postseason history a replay was used to confirm a field call of a fumble.|$|E
2500|$|American {{ambassador}} Nicholas Vliotes {{boarded the}} Achille Lauro to confirm Craxi's information about Klinghoffer's death. He found De Rosa distraught, learned that Molqi {{had held the}} {{gun to his head}} during the ship-to-shore communication that claimed all the hostages were healthy. De Rosa in tears handed the ambassador Klinghoffer's passport. Veliotes called the American embassy with the ship-to-shore radio to give orders [...] "Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by the terrorists off of Tartus when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the attention of the Syrians. In my name, I want you to call the [...] foreign minister, tell him what we learned, tell him the circumstances, tell him in view of this {{and the fact that we}} – and presumably them – didn't have those facts, we insist that they prosecute those sons of bitches." ...|$|E

Just think of that!

60|$|Mrs. Makely {{said this}} was quite what she had {{expected}} of those people; that they were horrid and stingy and vulgar; and she should see what face {{they would have to}} ask her to take tickets when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up something. She began to be vexed with herself, she confessed, at the joke she was playing on Mr. Homos, and I noticed that she put herself rather defiantly en evidence in his company whenever she could in the presence of these reluctant ladies. She told me she had not the courage to ask the clerk how many of the tickets he had sold out of those she had left at the desk.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Speaker, I see I {{have but}} three minutes left, and this forces me {{to throw out}} one whole branch of my subject. A single word on still another. The Democrats are keen enough to {{frequently}} remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks. Our good friend from Baltimore immediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party General Taylor would ultimately {{fall into the hands}} of. That was a new idea to me. I knew we had dissenters, but I did not know <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our candidate away from us. I would like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time. Some such we certainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats? Is it all union and harmony in your ranks? no bickerings? no divisions? If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party? I have heard some things from New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog-stealing. The clerk read on till he got to and through the words, [...] "did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs," [...] at which he exclaimed, [...] "Well, by golly, that is the most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!" [...] If there is any other gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are about this time, I have not heard of it.|$|E

6000|$|This 'umbrella man' {{was telling}} of his vicar's {{delight in the}} {{beautiful}} chalice veil that had been sent by Mrs. Egremont, and Nuttie was communicating, as a secret she ought not to tell, that mother was working a set of stoles, and hoped to have the white ones ready by the dedication anniversary; also {{that there was a}} box being filled for the St. Ambrose Christmas tree. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something nice for each of the choir boys and of the old women; and therewith, to May's surprise, this youth, whom she regarded as a sort of shopman, fell into full narration of all the events of a highly-worked parish,--all about the choral festival, and the guilds, and the choir, and the temperance work. A great deal of it was a strange language to May, but she half-disapproved of it, as entirely unlike the 'soberness' of Bridgefield ways, and like the Redcastle vicar, whom her father commonly called 'that madman.' Still, she had a practical soul for parish work, and could appreciate the earnestness that manifested itself, and the exertions made for people of the classes whom she had always supposed too bad or else too well off to come under clerical supervision. And her aunt and cousin and this young man all evidently had their hearts in it! For Nuttie--though her new world had put the old one apparently aside--had plunged into all the old interests, and asked questions eagerly, and listened to their answers, as if Micklethwayte news was water to the thirsty. The two were too happy to meet, and, it must be confessed, had not quite manners enough, to feel it needful to include in their conversation the weary figure that plodded along at a little distance from them, hardly attending to the details of their chatter, yet deriving new notions from it of the former life of Ursula and her mother, matters which she had hitherto thought beneath her attention, except so far as to be thankful that they had emerged from it so presentable. That it was a more actively religious, and perhaps a more intellectual one than her own, she had thought impossible, where everything must be second-rate. And yet, when her attention had wandered from an account of Mr. Dutton's dealings with a refractory choir boy bent on going to the races, she found a discussion going on about some past lectures upon astronomy, and Nuttie vehemently regretting the not attending two courses promised for the coming winter upon electricity and on Italian art, and mournfully observing, 'We never go to anything sensible here.' ...|$|E
