The name of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> was suggested by Lebeuf, after Mathilde, the wife of Moritz Loewywho was the vice director of the observatory in Paris.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt {{occupies}} the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E

40|$|Echinoderms {{as a rule}} are pentamerous and {{therefore}} most of <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> have only five arms. However, some of <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> like Luidia maculata, Acanthaster planci and others always have more than five arms. In some of <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> like Pentaceraster regulus and Protoreaster lincki. the number of arms may be less than five or more than five due to freak formation {{at the time of}} development...|$|R
40|$|In {{assessing}} <b>the</b> risk an <b>asteroid</b> {{may pose}} to <b>the</b> Earth, <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> state is often predicted for many years, often decades. Only by accounting for <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> initial state uncertainty can {{a measure of}} the risk be calculated. With <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> state uncertainty growing {{as a function of the}} initial velocity uncertainty, orbit velocity at the last state update, and the time from the last update to the epoch of interest, <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> position uncertainties can grow to many times the size of the Earth when propagated to the encounter risk corridor. This paper examines the merits of propagating <b>the</b> <b>asteroids</b> state covariance as an analytical matrix. The results of this study help to bound the efficacy of applying different metrics for assessing <b>the</b> risk an <b>asteroid</b> poses to <b>the</b> Earth. Additionally, this work identifies a criterion for when different covariance propagation methods are needed to continue predictions after an Earth-encounter period...|$|R
5|$|After rescuing all the Tribals and {{restoring}} the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> and confront Mizar. To {{the surprise of}} all though, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. Realising that destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance of destroying <b>the</b> <b>asteroid,</b> the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, a little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. The team returns to the starship and departs shortly before Floyd destroys <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> Afterwards on Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> bodies, <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt also {{contains}} bands of dust with particle radii {{of up to}} a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have swept across <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative {{action of the}} resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Asteroids in <b>the</b> <b>{{asteroid}}</b> belt {{are divided}} into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Ceres, <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt's only dwarf planet, {{is about}} 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The {{remaining}} bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> This suggests that there are no major variations of density within <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b> Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly {{between the}} orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is {{occupied}} by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E

5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through <b>the</b> <b>asteroid,</b> which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over {{such a large}} volume {{that it would be}} {{improbable}} to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
