40|$|Introduction. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to quantify the presence of occupational stressors and to analyze their effects on temporary and permanent working ability of workers with arterial hypertension. Material and Methods. The research included 817 workers. The study group consisted of 504 workers with arterial hypertension without other diseases or disorders, whereas the control group was composed of 313 healthy workers. Results. The study group showed a significantly higher level of <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> stress index {{as well as of the}} stress index related to high job demands, conflicts at work place, underload and time limit (p< 0. 001) compared to the control group. A positive and statistically significant correlation between <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> stress index and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found in the study group. The <b>total</b> level of <b>occupational</b> stress over 40 led to a significant increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in persons with arterial hypertension. The analysis of temporary working inability determined a statistically significantly higher level of lost workdays per a worker in the study group compared to the controls (p< 0. 001). The average number of lost workdays per a worker in a year in the study group increased statistically significantly along with the occupational stress index values at their work place (p< 0. 001). In the study group the number of workers eligible for disability retirement over a period of one year was significantly higher compared to the controls. The number of workers eligible for disability retirement in the exposed group increased statistically significantly along with occupational stress index values at their work place. Conclusion.

First, the results of long term monitoring onboard of an aircraft of Czech Airlines are presented. In the period May–December 2005, 494 individual flights have been followed using MDU-Liulin Si-diode based spectrometer, together with thermoluminescent and track detectors. The results of measurements are analyzed and {{compared with those of}} calculation performed with CARI 6 and EPCARD 3. 2 codes. Monitoring period represented about 4. 6 times more than usual annual engagement of an aircrew (600 hours). Total effective dose during these 2 755 hours was between 11 and 12 mSv, following the considered method of evaluation. Both the measuring and calculation methods correlate well. This fact leads to confirmation of the routine method evaluating the level of aircraft crew exposure using CARI 6 code as correct for this purpose.

The case group, including 60 patients (44 men and 16 women) with non-systemic chronic glomerulonephritis, established by biopsy, was compared with 120 control subjects (60 patients with traumatic fractures and 60 patients affected by nephrolithiasis) matched by sex and age. Information on occupational and non-occupational exposure to solvent was obtained by questionnaire. The exposure scores drawn from questionnaires were significantly higher in the case group than in the referent groups for both <b>total</b> and <b>occupational</b> solvent exposure. No significant differences in non-occupational exposure were found. The odds ratio of chronic glomerulonephritis for occupationally exposed (score > 0) was 3. 9 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 64 - 8. 33). When IgA nephropathy patients (n = 27) were separately evaluated, an increased risk was found for both <b>total</b> and <b>occupational</b> exposure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{relationships}} between satisfaction with occupational factors, operationalized as occupational status and the <b>total</b> daily <b>occupational</b> situation, and health-related variables among people with schizophrenia. The health-related variables included quality of life, perceived control, sense of coherence, and psychopathology. Gender differences in these relationships were explored as well. METHODS: A sample of 74 individuals, aged 20 - 55 years, from outpatient psychiatric services were recruited to the study. A variety of interviews and self-rating scales were used in the data collection. RESULTS: When controlling for depressive symptoms, the results showed that satisfaction with employment status was of significance for health among patients with schizophrenia, but satisfaction with the <b>total</b> daily <b>occupational</b> situation seemed to be even more important to quality of life and other health-related aspects. In particular, satisfaction with daily occupations constituted an important dimension for self-rated quality of life. Some minor sex differences could be discerned in the pattern of associations. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between satisfaction with daily occupations and self-rated quality of life adds a new dimension to the understanding of quality of life for this group of subjects, and suggests that helping to organise an individual's daily occupations ought to be a significant task in planning for psychiatric services...|$|R

40|$|Importance In China, the {{patterns}} {{and levels of}} physical activity differed from those in high-income countries. Substantial uncertainty remains about the relevance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of domain-specific physical activity for cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtypes in Chinese adults. Objective To assess the shape and strength of the associations of <b>total,</b> <b>occupational,</b> and nonoccupational physical activity with CVD subtypes in Chinese men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based prospective cohort study in 10 (5 urban, 5 rural) areas across China included 487   334 adults who were aged 30 to 79 (mean 51) years with no prior CVD history when enrolled from June 2004 to July 2008. Exposures Self-reported <b>total,</b> <b>occupational,</b> and nonoccupational physical activity, quantified as metabolic equivalent of task hours per day (MET-h/d) based on the type, frequency, and duration of specific activities. Main Outcomes and Measures Major vascular events (n[*]=[*] 36   184) and their components, including major coronary events (n[*]=[*] 5082), ischemic stroke (n[*]=[*] 25   647), intracerebral hemorrhage (n[*]=[*] 5252), and CVD death (n[*]=[*] 8437). Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios for each disease that was associated with physical activity. Results Of the 487   334 study participants, 287   527 (59 %) were women and the mean (SD) age was 51 (10. 5) years. The overall mean (SD) total physical activity was 21. 5 (12. 8) MET-h/d, mainly from occupational activity, especially among men (75 % vs 50 % in women). Total physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of major vascular events, with the adjusted hazard ratio that compared the top vs bottom quintiles of physical activity being 0. 77 (95 % CI, 0. 74 - 0. 80). Throughout the range of total physical activity studied, the association with CVD with each 4 MET-h/d higher usual total physical activity (approximately 1 hour of brisk walking per day) associated with a 6 % (95 % CI, 5 %- 7 %) lower risk of major vascular events, and a 9 %, 5 %, 6 %, and 12 % lower risk of major coronary events, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and CVD death, respectively. The strength of the associations was similar and independent of each other for occupational and nonoccupational physical activity. However, for occupational physical activity, the associations with CVD subtypes were greatly attenuated above 20 MET-h/d, especially for intracerebral hemorrhage. The associations of total physical activity with major vascular events were similar among {{men and women and}} across different levels of sedentary leisure time but were much weaker among individuals with high blood pressure. Conclusions and Relevance Among Chinese adults, higher occupational or nonoccupational physical activity was associated with significantly lower risks of major CVD...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine whether a {{dose-response}} relationship exists between psychological distress and types of physical activity (<b>total,</b> <b>occupational,</b> and leisuretime). The study subjects (233 men and 313 women) were recruited for a study on cardiovascular disease in the Yangpyeong community located in South Korea. The type and characteristics of physical activity were measured with {{a modified version of}} the Stanford 5 city project’s questionnaire by well-trained interviewers using a standard protocol. The Psychological Well-being Index-Short Form was used to assess psychological distress. Both the intensity and duration of time in either total physical activity or occupational physical activity (OPA) were not related to the distress score. However, a long duration of time (1 hr/day) in severely intensive (≥ 6 metabolic equivalent) OPA was related to a high distress score in men (14. 1 for none vs. 19. 7, p-for-trend= 0. 005), even after the adjustment for leisure-time physical activity (LTPA). A long duration in time (1 hr/day) in LTPA was related to a lower distress score in men independent of their OPA (16. 7 for none vs. 13. 1, p-for-trend= 0. 02). In conclusion, the dose-response relationship of physical activity on psychological distress appeared to differ among the different types of activities.

Lifestyle-related risk factors: smoking, obesity, sedentariness {{and excess}} alcohol intake {{are among the}} most {{important}} known causes of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between these lifestyle-related risk factors for cancer/cardiovascular disease and working conditions among surgeons/anesthesiologists and other physicians. Material and Methods. The study was carried out among physicians aged 35 to 60, without diagnosed coronary heart disease or other structural heart disease, who were employed at the Novi Sad University Hospital. The participation rate was high (> 90 %). The physicians completed the Occupational Stress Index. Low lifestyle-related cancer/cardiovascular risk was defined as: not a current smoker, body mass index < 28, regular recreational physical activity and not consuming alcohol every day. Analysis of covariance was performed. Results. Of 191 physicians included in this study only 23 (12. 0 %) had a low lifestyle- related cancer/cardiovascular risk. Surgeons/anesthesiologists faced a heavier total work stressor burden than physicians in other profiles (87. 7 ± 8. 8 versus 74. 1 ± 10. 5, p= 0. 000).

40|$|Background: Physical {{and mental}} health of workers is {{threatened}} due to various events and chronic occupational stress. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the relationship between occupational stress and gastric disease in male workers of the shipbuilding industry. Methods: Occupational stress measured among a total of 498 workers of a shipbuilding firm who visited the hospital for health examination using the Korean Occupational Stress Scale (KOSS) -short form, and the relationship between sociodemographic factors, health-related behaviors, occupational stress, and gastric disease, and the distribution of occupational stress by sociodemographic factors in the gastric disease group was examined. Results: There was no significant association between gastric disease and <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> stress score and its seven sub-factors. The analysis showed that risk of gastric disease was significantly higher in the Q 1 group in which the stress caused by occupational discomfort among seven sub-factors was lowest than that in the Q 4 group (odds ratio, 2. 819; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 151 to 6. 908). Analysis only on the gastric disease group showed that the stress score of laborers was higher in the four sub-factors than that of office workers (P < 0. 05). Analysis on educational background showed that the scores of the three sub-factors were lower in subjects who’s highest level of education was high school (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: This study suggests {{that it is necessary to}} improve the culture of Korean collectivism in the workplace and to manage the occupational stress in the low-educated and laborers. It is recommended for future studies to confir...|$|R
40|$|Working in mines is {{associated}} with acute and chronic occupational disorders. Most of the uranium mining in the United States {{took place in the}} Four Corners region of the Southwest (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) and on Native American lands. Although the uranium industry collapsed in the late 1980 s, the industry employed several thousand individuals who continue to be at increased risk for developing lung cancers. We present the case of a 72 -year-old Navajo male who worked for 17 years as an underground uranium miner and who developed lung cancer 22 years after leaving the industry. His <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> exposure to radon progeny was estimated at 506 working level months. The miner was a life-long nonsmoker and had no other significant occupational or environmental exposures. On the chest X-ray taken at admission into the hospital, a right lower lung zone infiltrate was detected. The patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia and developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure worsened and the patient died 19 days after presenting. On autopsy, a 2. 5 cm squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung arising from the lower lobe bronchus, a right broncho-esophageal fistula, and a right lower lung abscess were found. Malignant respiratory disease in uranium miners may be from several occupational exposures; for example, radon decay products, silica, and possibly diesel exhaust are respiratory carcinogens that were commonly encountered. In response to a growing number of affected uranium miners, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) was passed by the U. S. Congress in 1990 to make partial restitution to individuals harmed by radiation exposure resulting from underground uranium mining and above-ground nuclear tests in Nevada...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin {{is one of the}} most common cancers in the United States, with no proven means for prevention other than systemic retinoids, which have significant toxicity, and sunscreen. We sought to determine the risk factors for invasive SCC on the face or ears in a high-risk population comprising 1, 131 veterans in the Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention (VATTC) Trial. Participants were required to have been diagnosed with at least two keratinocyte carcinomas (KCs) in the 5 years prior to enrollment. The median duration of follow-up was 3. 7 years. Twenty-three percent of the participants developed a new invasive SCC, and the cumulative risk of invasive SCC was 30 % at 5 years. The following factors independently predicted for new invasive SCCs: number of invasive SCCs and number of in situ SCCs in the 5 years prior to enrollment, actinic keratoses count at enrollment, a history of ever use of topical 5 -fluorouracil, and <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> time spent outdoors. In contrast, the use of angiotensin-convering enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during the study and a history of warts anywhere on the body were found to protect against new invasive SCCs. These independent predictors remained the same for all SCCs (invasive and in situ combined). The number of basal cell carcinomas in the 5 years prior to enrollment, sunburns, sun sensitivity, and recreational sun exposure were not associated with new SCCs. These findings identify key risk factors for additional SCCs in patients with multiple prior KCs, and suggest that a history of warts may be associated with reduced SCC risk...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{occupational}} {{light vehicle}} research has concentrated on employees using cars. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify and characterise the <b>total</b> <b>occupational</b> light vehicle-user population and compare it with the privately-used light vehicle population. Occupational light vehicle and private light vehicle populations were identified through use-related 2003 registration categories from New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority data. Key groups of occupational light vehicle registration variables were comparatively assessed as potential determinants of occupational light vehicleuser risks. These comparisons were expressed as odds ratios with 95 % Confidence Intervals. The occupational light vehicle population vehicles (n= 646, 201) comprised 18 % of all light vehicle registrations. A number of statistical differences emerge between the two populations. For instance, 86 % of occupational light vehicle registrants were male versus 65 % of private registrants, and 56 % of the occupational users registered load shape vehicles versus 20 % of the private registrants. Occupational light vehicles registered for farming or taxi use were more than six times more likely to belong to sole-traders than organisations. Sole-traders were nearly twice as likely to register light-trucks, and twice as likely to register older vehicles, than organisations. This study demonstrates that the occupational light vehicle user population is larger and more diverse than previously shown with characteristics likely to increase the relative risks of motor vehicle crashes. More occupational light vehicles were load shapes and therefore likely to have poorer crashworthiness ratings than cars. Occupational light vehicles are frequently used by sole-traders for activities with increased OHS risks including farming and taxi use. Further exploration of occupational light vehicle-user crash risks should include all vehicle types, work arrangements and small ‘fleets’...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn recent decades, the {{prevalence}} of physical activity has declined considerably in many developed countries, which has been related to rising levels of obesity and several weight-related medical conditions, such as coronary heart disease. There is evidence that areas exhibiting particularly low levels of physical activity have undergone a strong transition away from employment in physically demanding occupations. It is proposed that such processes of deindustrialisation may be causally linked to unexplained geographical disparities in physical activity. This study investigates how geographical variations in deindustrialisation are associated with current levels of physical activity across different activity domains and relevant macro-economic time periods in England. The analysis includes data on 27, 414 adults from the Health Survey for England 2006 and 2008 who reported <b>total,</b> <b>occupational,</b> domestic, recreational and walking activity. Based on employment change in industries associated with heavy manual work, a local measurement of industrial decline was developed, covering the period 1841 – 2001. We applied a multilevel modelling approach to study associations between industrial decline and physical activity. Results indicate {{that the process of}} deindustrialisation appears to be associated with patterns of physical activity and that this is independent of household income. The effects observed were generally similar for men and women. However, the nature of the association differed across areas, time periods and employment types; in particular, residents of districts characterised by a history of manufacturing and mining employment had increased odds of reporting low activity levels. We conclude that post-industrial change may be a factor in explaining present-day variations in physical activity, emphasising the plausible impact of inherited cultures and regional identities on health related behaviours...|$|R
40|$|The {{etiologic}} role {{of physical}} activity in endometrial cancer risk remains unclear given the few epidemiologic {{studies that have been}} conducted. To investigate this relation more fully, an analysis was undertaken in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC). During an average 6. 6 years of follow-up, 689 incident endometrial cancer cases were identified from an analytic cohort within EPIC of 253, 023 women. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations between type of activity (<b>total,</b> <b>occupational,</b> household, recreational) and endometrial cancer risk. For total activity, women in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of activity had a risk of 0. 88 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI = 0. 61 - 1. 27). No clear associations between each type of activity and endometrial cancer risk were found for the total study population combined. Associations were more evident in the stratified results, with premenopausal women who were active versus inactive experiencing a risk of 0. 66 (95 % CI = 0. 38 - 1. 14) overall. Among premenopausal women, for household and recreational activities the risk estimates in the highest as compared with the lowest quartiles were, respectively, 0. 48 (95 % CI = 0. 23 - 0. 99) and 0. 78 (95 % CI = 0. 44 - 1. 39). No effect modification by body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive use or energy intake was found. This study provides no evidence of a protective effect of increased physical activity in endometrial cancer risk in all women but some support for a benefit among premenopausal women. The relative risk reductions are most apparent for household activities. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
