5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through <b>this</b> <b>alone.</b> A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> {{does not}} explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known carnivorous species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves carnivorous, the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known carnivorous plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation.

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>alone</b> is {{not enough}} to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{continued}} {{peace negotiations}} with the Scots {{in a bid to}} gain time before launching a new military campaign. Because of his financial weakness, he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture. Both English and Irish parliaments were summoned in the early months of 1640. In March 1640, the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May. In the English general election in March, however, court candidates fared badly, and Charles's dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate. The earls of Northumberland and Strafford attempted to broker a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £650,000 (although the cost of the coming war was estimated at around £1million). Nevertheless, <b>this</b> <b>alone</b> was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons. The Parliamentarians' calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still retained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of Northumberland, the Short Parliament (as it came to be known) was dissolved in May 1640, {{less than a month after}} it assembled.|$|E
