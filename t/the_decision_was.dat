5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made and not whether <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|After a {{new term}} of {{negotiations}} between the parties, IUPAC decided to allow the name seaborgium for element 106 and changed the name of element 102 to flerovium after Georgy Flerov following the recognition by the 1993 report that the element had been first convincingly synthesized in Dubna. However, this compromise was also rejected by the American scientists and <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> retracted. The name flerovium was later used for element 114.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia.
