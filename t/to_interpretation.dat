5|$|Kubah was {{the second}} novel written by Ahmad Tohari, {{who had been in}} senior high school when the G30S {{announced}} its coup. A devout Muslim who had trained as a doctor and ran a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Central Java, Tohari began to focus on writing when his first novel, Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak (On the Foothill of Cibalak; 1978), won a prize from the Jakarta Arts Council. He finished Kubah in two months, first making a thematic overview for each chapter and then developing it further while writing. He deliberately left the novel's ending open <b>to</b> <b>interpretation,</b> intending for readers to think for themselves.|$|E

Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E

5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject <b>to</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open <b>to</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and inalienable possessions can {{be influenced by}} cognitive factors. Languages, such as English, that do not encode the alienability distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are “inherently relational” and whose possession {{is associated with a}} single, dominant interpretation (e.g. mother), are of the inalienable type, whereas nouns whose possession is open <b>to</b> <b>interpretation</b> (e.g. car), are of the alienable type.|$|E

5000|$|The {{centrality}} of Billy Budd's extraordinary good {{looks in the}} novella, where he is described by Captain Vere as [...] "the young fellow who seems so popular with the men—Billy, the Handsome Sailor," [...] have led <b>to</b> <b>interpretations</b> of a homoerotic sensibility in the novel. Laura Mulvey added a theory of scopophilia and masculine and feminine subjectivity/objectivity. (Quote from Billy Budd, Sailor, Penguin Popular Classics, 1995, p. 54). This version tends <b>to</b> inform <b>interpretations</b> of Britten's opera, perhaps owing to the composer's own homosexuality.|$|R

25|$|The {{definitions}} of the outcomes decided upon are subject <b>to</b> <b>interpretation</b> by those implementing them.

As a result, outcomes are not yet widely recognized as a valid way of conceptualizing what learning is about.|$|E
