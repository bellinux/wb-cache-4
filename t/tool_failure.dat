However, a great impact on the process cost efficiency is related to tooling costs. The thesis is focused on the identification of tool costs in relation of the entire cold forged process. In the first step, using web researches, the different markets in which cold forged product can be applied are analysed, due to the advantages of cold forging process, which made it suitable for the particular markets. Afterwards, cold forging chain and tool making chain are analysed together, by means of literature researches. Furthermore, in cold forging analysis, particular attention is paid on the identification of leverages of profitability. In order to do this, a cost model is implemented.

40|$|Hot forming {{processes}} such as forging, {{die casting}} and glass forming require tooling that is subjected to high temperatures during the manufacturing of components. Current tooling is adversely affected by prolonged exposure at high temperatures. Initial studies were conducted to determine {{the root cause of}} <b>tool</b> <b>failures</b> in a number of applications. Results show that <b>tool</b> <b>failures</b> vary and depend on the operating environment under which they are used. Major root cause failures include (1) thermal softening, (2) fatigue and (3) tool erosion, all of which are affected by process boundary conditions such as lubrication, cooling, process speed, etc. While thermal management is a key to addressing <b>tooling</b> <b>failures,</b> it was clear that new tooling materials with superior high temperature strength could provide improved manufacturing efficiencies. These efficiencies are based on the use of functionally graded materials (FGM), a new subset of hybrid tools with customizable properties that can be fabricated using advanced powder metallurgy manufacturing technologies. Modeling studies of the various hot forming processes helped identify the effect of key variables such as stress, temperature and cooling rate and aid in the selection of tooling materials for specific applications. To address the problem of high temperature strength, several advanced powder metallurgy nickel and cobalt based alloys were selected for evaluation. These materials were manufactured into tooling using two relatively new consolidation processes. One process involved laser powder deposition (LPD) and the second involved a solid state dynamic powder consolidation (SSDPC) process. These processes made possible functionally graded materials (FGM) that resulted in shaped tooling that was monolithic, bi-metallic or substrate coated. Manufacturing of tooling with these processes was determined to be robust and consistent for a variety of materials. Prototype and production testing of FGM tooling showed the benefits of the nickel and cobalt based powder metallurgy alloys in a number of applications evaluated. Improvements in tool life ranged from three (3) to twenty (20) or more times than currently used tooling. Improvements were most dramatic where tool softening and deformation were the major cause of <b>tool</b> <b>failures</b> in hot/warm forging applications. Significant improvement was also noted in erosion of aluminum die casting tooling. Cost and energy savings can be realized as a result of increased tooling life, increased productivity and a reduction in scrap because of improved dimensional controls. Although LPD and SSDPC tooling usually have higher acquisition costs, net tooling costs per component produced drops dramatically with superior tool performance. Less energy is used to manufacture the tooling because fewer tools are required and less recycling of used tools are needed for the hot forming process. Energy is saved during the component manufacturing cycle because more parts can be produced in shorter periods of time. Energy is also saved by minimizing heating furnace idling time because of less downtime for tooling changes...|$|R

The applications extend to many fields that demand high-level tolerances from microproducts and component functional and structural integrity.

This research deals with predicting microtool failure by studying spindle runout and tool deflection effects on the tool, and by measuring the cutting force that would fail the tool during microend-milling.

30|$|The {{increase}} in cutting temperature normally causes the premature cutting <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> or excessive tool wear, {{while most of}} the wear processes occurs at the major flank face and rake face of the cutting tool. There are four main wear mechanisms in association with <b>tool</b> <b>failure,</b> including: oxidation, abrasion, adhesion and diffusion. All of these wears are related to the temperature sensitivity even under normal cutting conditions [20, 21]. At low cutting temperature (due to soft cutting or high cooling efficiency), adhesive and abrasive wears are dominant. While the cutting temperature is higher than a certain threshold, thermal induced wear, such as oxidation and diffusion, are activated and dominate total wear. The utilization of cutting fluid, traditionally applied to remove heat generated from the cutting process, can additionally cause environmental pollution, health hazards, surface contamination and an increased cost of production [22]. The above issues can be avoided by using an internally-cooled smart cutting tool.|$|E
40|$|Drilling {{process is}} a {{material}} removal process to produce a hole. Any hole 10 times to its diameter is considered a deep hole. There {{are a lot of}} applications in industry that demand on the depth of hole to be drilled such as die, engines and aerospace industries. The depth of hole can minimize the operation and save money. Since the drilling process are move to the automated manufacturing environment nowadays. One of the primary issues in deep drilling technique is tool wear and failure which can affect the sustainability of the process. Therefore, based on collective data, classifying the tool wear mechanism and failure of deep drilling, the tool life stage can be identified and tool major fracture can be avoided. In this experiment, signal processing method was chosen to monitor the tool condition. By using the two sensors which is dynamometer and accelerometer, the signal data obtained was then being analyzed using three different signal processing techniques which are Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The SKD 61 material and the High Speed Steel (HSS) drill bit was used to carry out the experiment. There are 25 sets of experiments with different parameter used for each set. The parameter used was determined using Design of Experiment (DOE) method. Every sets of experiment were repeated three times to increase the accuracy of the signal data obtained. Based on classification data, the feedrate and cutting speed above 298. 8 mm/min and 1592 rpm will lead to tool failure; blunt or fracture. Time domain graph shows the force produced at z axis is the highest. Using FFT, there is no dominant frequency for the good tool condition. However there are some dominant frequencies for blunt and fracture tool. To differentiate between blunt and fracture, the amplitude of FFT gives the higher value when the tool is fracture. This is due to the tool bending and chip clogging. STFT was used to illustrate when is the high frequency region was occur. Then, the signal data was analyzed using HHT which decompose the time series into a set of components called intrinsic mode functions (IMF). IMF was used to detect <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> by means of the energies of the characteristics IMF associated with characteristics frequencies of the drilling process. When the <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> occurs, the energies of associated characteristics IMF change in opposite directions. Based on signal data and the tool condition, the type of <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> was classified whether the tool is good, blunt or fracture. The optimization usage of machining parameter also influences the tool condition during the drilling process was perform. Since the time domain just can capture the time and force produced during the process, the FFT in needed to measure the frequency along the experiment. The FFT amplitude may control the tool life and failure. However, the STFT is used to capture the right time when the high frequency region was occur. Other than that, the time when <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> occurs can be traced through the associated IMF characteristics generated using HHT methods. Consequently, the signal data processing is not only used to detect the <b>tool</b> <b>failure,</b> but {{it can be used to}} develop a system for online <b>tool</b> <b>failure</b> detection which can detect the failure and control the machine parameter to be optimized with the tool conditions...|$|E
