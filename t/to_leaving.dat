40|$|Abstract Background Lebanon is {{perceived}} to be suffering from excessive nurse migration, low job satisfaction, poor retention and high turnover. Little is known about the magnitude of nurse migration and predictors of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the extent of nurses' intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and examine the impact of job satisfaction on intent <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> was explored <b>to</b> differentiate between nurses who intend <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their current hospital and those intending <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to survey nurses currently practicing in Lebanese hospitals. A total of 1, 793 nurses employed in 69 hospitals were surveyed. Questions included those relating to demographic characteristics, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and the McCloskey Mueller Satisfaction Scale. Univariate descriptive statistics were conducted on sample's demographic characteristics including gender, age, marital status and educational level. Bivariate associations between intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and demographic characteristics were tested using Pearson Chi-square. Differences in satisfaction scores between nurses with and without intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> were tested using t-test and ANOVA f-test. A multinomial logistic regression model was created to predict intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital and intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country. Results An alarming 67. 5 % reported intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> within the next 1 to 3 years, many of whom disclosed intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country (36. 7 %). Within nurses who reported an intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital but stay in Lebanon, 22. 1 % plan to move to a different health organization in Lebanon, 29. 4 % plan <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the profession and 48. 5 % had other plans. Nurses reported being least satisfied with extrinsic rewards. A common predictor of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the hospital and the country was dissatisfaction with extrinsic rewards. Other predictors of intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> (country or hospital) included age, gender, marital status, degree type, and dissatisfaction with scheduling, interaction opportunities, and control and responsibility. Conclusion Study findings demonstrate linkages between job satisfaction, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and migration in a country suffering from a nursing shortage. Findings can be used by health care managers and policy makers in managing job satisfaction, intent <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and nurse migration. </p...|$|R

Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E

5|$|Even before Monitor was commissioned, she ran an {{unsuccessful}} set of sea trials on 19 February. Valve {{problems with the}} main engine {{and one of the}} fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March. Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson's carriage for the 11-inch guns. Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing, he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret, fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E

In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E

5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's {{draft was}} too much of a {{morality}} play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E
