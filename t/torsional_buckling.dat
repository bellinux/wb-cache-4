Since current design specifications only consider individual buckling between cross-frames formulti-girder systems, this study utilizes global lateral <b>torsional</b> vertical <b>buckling</b> strength of such girder systems. Elastic eigen value analysis was conducted using the finite element program, ABAQUS. Models with varying degrees of curvature, flange width-to-thickness ratio of 12, 10 and 8 and span length-to-depth ratio of 16, 20 and 24 were generated and their respective maximum cross-frame spacing was computed. These models were then subjected to uniform bending in orderto obtain the buckling strength and different buckling modes from the analysis. Finally, critical buckling capacity ratio (Mcurved/Mstraight) was used to establish the effect of the existing cross-frame spacing limit on the buckling strength of horizontally curved multi-girder systems. Using comparative analysis, the results showed that the existing cross-frame spacing limit gave conservative critical buckling capacity ratio for models with high degree of curvature.

40|$|The current design {{procedure}} for steel frame structures is a two-step process including an elastic analysis to determine design actions {{and a separate}} member capacity check. This design procedure is unable to trace {{the full range of}} load-deflection response and hence the failure modes of the frame structures can not be accurately predicted. In recent years, the development of advanced analysis methods has aimed at solving this problem by combining the analysis and design tasks into one step. Application of the new advanced analysis methods permits a comprehensive assessment of the actual failure modes and ultimate strengths of structural steel systems in practical design situations. One of the advanced analysis methods, the refined plastic hinge method, has shown great potential to become a practical design tool. However, at present, it is only suitable for a special class of steel frame structures that is not subject to lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> effects. The refined plastic hinge analysis can directly account for three types of frame failures, gradual formation of plastic hinges, column buckling and local buckling. However, this precludes most of the steel frame structures whose behaviour is governed by lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling.</b> Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop a practical advanced analysis method suitable for general steel frame structures including the effects of lateral-torsional buckling. Lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> is a complex three dimensional instability phenomenon. Unlike the in-plane buckling of beam-columns, a closed form analytical solution is not available for lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling.</b> The member capacity equations used in design specifications are derived mainly from testing of simply supported beams. Further, there has been very limited research into the behaviour and design of steel frame structures subject to lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> failures. Therefore in order to incorporate lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> effects into an advanced analysis method, a detailed study must be carried out including inelastic beam buckling failures. This thesis contains a detailed description of research on extending the scope of advanced analysis by developing methods that include the effects of lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> in a nonlinear analysis formulation. It has two components. Firstly, distributed plasticity models were developed using the state-of-the-art finite element analysis programs for a range of simply supported beams and rigid frame structures to investigate and fully understand their lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> behavioural characteristics. Nonlinear analyses were conducted to study the load-deflection response of these structures under lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> influences. It was found that the behaviour of simply supported beams and members in rigid frame structures is significantly different. In real frame structures, the connection details are a decisive factor in terms of ultimate frame capacities. Accounting for the connection rigidities in a simplified advanced analysis method is very difficult, but is most critical. Generally, the finite element analysis results of simply supported beams agree very well with the predictions of the current Australian steel structures design code AS 4100, but the capacities of rigid frame structures can be significantly higher compared with Australian code predictions. The second part of the thesis concerns the development of a two dimensional refined plastic hinge analysis which is capable of considering lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> effects. The formulation of the new method is based on the observations from the distributed plasticity analyses of both simply supported beams and rigid frame structures. The lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> effects are taken into account implicitly using a flexural stiffness reduction factor in the stiffness matrix formulation based on the member capacities specified by AS 4100. Due to the lack of suitable alternatives, concepts of moment modification and effective length factors are still used for determining the member capacities. The effects of connection rigidities and restraints from adjacent members are handled by using appropriate effective length factors in the analysis. Compared with the benchmark solutions for simply supported beams, the new refined plastic hinge analysis is very accurate. For rigid frame structures, the new method is generally more conservative than the finite element models. The accuracy of the new method relies on the user's judgement of beam segment restraints. Overall, the design capacities in the new method are superior to those in the current design procedure, especially for frame structures with less slender members. The new refined plastic hinge analysis is now able to capture four types of failure modes, plastic hinge formation, column buckling, local buckling and lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling.</b> With the inclusion of lateral <b>torsional</b> <b>buckling</b> mode as proposed in this thesis, advanced analysis is one step closer to being used for general design practice...|$|E

40|$|Plated {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in many engineering structures. Most designs are poor in resisting compressive forces. Usually, the buckling phenomena observed in compressed conditions take place rather suddenly and may lead to catastrophic structural failure. Therefore {{it is important to}} know the buckling capacities of the plates and stiffeners in order to avoid premature failure. However not every model and/or analysis is suitable for an accurate buckling assessment by a FEM analysis. Buckling is a complicated phenomenon. Many properties and parameters influence the buckling strength. Most of the time, details such as imperfections, material properties or residual stresses are not included within the model. Hence, the lack of a satisfying analysis is tried to resolve with a combination of linear FEM results and standards. In the standards, just as in most literature, the behaviour of a panel is simplified by subdividing it into individual sections; plate fields and beam-columns. This study mainly aims to define the conversion of linear FEM stress results into input design stresses needed to check buckling of plated structures with the standards. The report first contains an in-depth research into what problems arise with different buckling modes and the parameters that define these problems. Furthermore several proposals for implementation of the standards are explained; plate buckling, local stiffener buckling, flexural stiffener <b>buckling</b> and <b>torsional</b> stiffener <b>buckling.</b> A more extensive part is about the validation of the plate buckling implementation.

40|$|A {{circular}} arch with in-plane radial loads uniformly distributed around the arch axis is primarily sub-jected to uniform compression. Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed radial loads. Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed radial loads always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform radial loads may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section. In this case, the radial loads produce an additional <b>torsional</b> moment during <b>buckling</b> which affects the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch.
