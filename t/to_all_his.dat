5|$|Following {{the death}} of Mary II from {{smallpox}} in 1694, William III restored Anne’s honours, as she was then become next in line to the throne, and provided her with apartments at St. James's Palace. He also restored the Earl of Marlborough <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, {{and he did not}} make her regent in his absences though she was now his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|In French drawings, Vengeur {{is often}} {{depicted}} as flying the Tricolour, {{which had been}} recently ordered by the Convention to be flown as battle ensign; however, {{due to a lack}} of bunting in Brest, Villaret had not been able to distribute this flag <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> ships, and thus Vengeur probably still flew the white flag with a canton of three equal columns of red, white, and blue.|$|E
5|$|Leleiohoku had {{received}} thirty-six ʻāina (land parcels), {{mainly on the}} island of Hawaiʻi and Maui from King Kamehameha III. Thus after Leleiohoku's death, Kīnaʻu became the heir <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> father's property, including Huliheʻe Palace in Kailua-Kona.

5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or {{come to grips with}} the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans Pareil, Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E

His wife died not long after the union and was buried on 18 September 1702. The artist lived above his means and was forced in 1703 <b>to</b> sell <b>all</b> <b>his</b> paintings.

25|$|To further those ends {{he founded}} and edited a journal, Labour World, in September 1890, then {{initiated}} in January 1891 in Cork the Irish Democratic Labour Federation, an organisation which adopted an advanced social programme including proposals for free education, land settlement, worker housing, reduced working hours, labour political representation and universal suffrage. The Federation reflected his conviction, {{to which he}} adhered <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> life, that farmers' land proprietorship must {{go hand in hand}} with land nationalisation.|$|E

In 2010, Wynn switched to a vegan diet after watching the documentary Eating by Mike Anderson. According to Wynn, his vegan diet was also inspired by a guest on his yacht in St. Tropez, who discussed the environmental and health consequences of eating meat. After becoming a vegan, Wynn announced that he would add animal-free menus <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> restaurants.|$|E

Even during his arrival from Dubai back to Pakistan, {{a few days after the}} rest of the team, fans chanted 'Boom Boom Afridi' at the airport amidst high security.|$|E

25|$|Still, the {{recalcitrant}} Burmese king {{tried to}} hold on <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> gains. To reinforce the Chinese front, he recalled from Siam {{a major portion of}} the army, which arrived back to Ava with the Siamese captives in July 1767. As it turned out, the remaining Burmese forces in Siam, which {{could not have been more}} than 10,000 at most, were too scattered among many garrisons, and too small to hold the conquered kingdom together. Indeed, the Burmese had little control outside their garrisons, and no control over the Siamese countryside where gangs of bandits roamed.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Masters {{was hired}} as head of {{production}} for Catalina Video. William Higgins had founded Catalina in 1978. Catalina Video had been distributing Nova Studios' films to adult bookstores and video stores since about 1982. With Nova Studios in financial distress, Higgins and Masters struck a deal: Catalina would purchase {{the rights to the}} unreleased Boys Town. Masters would be free to sell the rights <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> other films to another vendor. Catalina would also hire Masters as its head of production, where he would also be free to write and direct films on an occasional basis.|$|E
25|$|To {{successfully}} govern a territory, Senapati {{also established}} alliance with supernatural power by performing austere meditation. According to Babad Mangkubumi, while performing {{a meditation on}} a stone {{in the middle of}} a river in between mount Merapi and the Indian Ocean, a gigantic mythical fish named Tunggulwulung offered Senapati a ride to venture south of the ocean where the most powerful spirit of Java governed the netherworld, named Kangjeng Ratu Kidul. Overwhelmed by the aura of Senapati, the queen offered support for his great efforts to conquer the people of Java.
