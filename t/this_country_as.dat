Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E

[...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15.

500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other and gazed at one another.

500|$|One {{consequence}} of the Cornwallis Code was that it, in effect, institutionalised racism in the legal system. [...] Cornwallis, in a manner not uncommon at the time, believed that well-bred gentlemen of European extraction were superior to others, including those that were the product of mixed relationships in India. [...] Of the latter, he wrote [...] "as on account of their colour & extraction they are considered in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> inferior to Europeans, I am of opinion that those of them who possess the best abilities could not command that authority and respect which is necessary in the due discharge of the duty of an officer." [...] In 1791 he issued an order that [...] "No person, {{the son of a}} Native Indian, shall henceforward be appointed by this Court to Employment in the Civil, Military, or Marine Service of the Company." [...] Cornwallis's biographers, the Wickwires, also observe that this institutionalisation of the British as an elite class simply added another layer on top of the complex status hierarchy of caste and religion that existed in India at the time. Cornwallis could not have formalised these policies without the (tacit or explicit) agreement of the company's directors and employees.|$|E
500|$|As {{the fourth}} season {{was about to}} begin, almost {{two years after the}} {{previous}} season's end, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that The Wire [...] "has tackled the drug war in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> it simultaneously explores race, poverty and 'the death of the American working class,' the failure of political systems to help the people they serve, and the tyranny of lost hope. Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner-city African Americans and none—not one—has done it as well." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety wrote at the time, [...] "When television history is written, little else will rival 'The Wire.'" [...] The New York Times called the fourth season of The Wire [...] "its best season yet." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times was more reserved in his praise, calling it the [...] "most ambitious" [...] show on television, but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline. The Los Angeles Times took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show, stating that [...] "even in what is generally acknowledged to be something of a golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas—both on cable channels and on network TV—The Wire stands out." [...] TIME magazine especially praised the fourth season, stating that [...] "no other TV show has ever loved a city so well, damned it so passionately, or sung it so searingly." [...] The website Metacritic, which gathers reviews from news sources and translates them into a percentage score, assigned The Wires fourth season a weighted average score of 98%, the second highest score for any television season in Metacritic history (with the fifth season of Breaking Bad being the first).|$|E

500|$|In 1813, {{with the}} tide of the Napoleonic Wars having turned firmly in Britain's favour, George began to seriously {{consider}} the question of Charlotte's marriage. [...] The Prince Regent and his advisors decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. [...] Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself {{and many of the}} guests. [...] Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers. [...] Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. [...] According to Charlotte, [...] "He spoke as if he had the most improper ideas of my inclinations. [...] I see that he is compleatly [...] poisoned against me, and that he will never come round." [...] She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry [...] "the Orange or the Cheese" [...] (a reference to Gloucester cheese), [...] "Slender Billy" [...] or [...] "Silly Billy". [...] The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that [...] "I could not quit <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> Queen of England still less" [...] and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to [...] "visit his frogs solo". [...] However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. [...] She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him.|$|E
