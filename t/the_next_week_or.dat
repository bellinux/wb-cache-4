He made his way southeast to Knoxville, Tennessee, through the Cumberland Gap. Bragg was quickly called to the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia, to explain to Jefferson Davis the charges brought by his officers about how he had conducted his campaign, who were demanding that he be replaced as head of the army. Although Davis decided to leave the general in command, Bragg's relationship with his subordinates would be severely damaged. Upon rejoining the army, he ordered a movement to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.|$|E
500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows {{all he has to}} do is keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility he might be able to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

Thus, he undertook the seemingly impossible [...] voyage to Timor, the nearest European settlement. [...] Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47-day voyage, the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua. From 4 May until 29 May, {{when they reached the}} Great Barrier Reef, the 18 men lived on [...] of bread per day. The weather was often stormy, and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat's heavily laden condition. On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia, which they named Restoration Island, 29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the British monarchy. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more they island-hopped north along the Great Barrier reef—while Bligh, cartographer as always, sketched maps of the coast. Early in June they passed through the Endeavour Strait and sailed again on the open sea until they reached Coupang, a settlement on Timor, on 15 June 1789. Several of the men who survived this ordeal with him soon died of sickness, possibly malaria, in the pestilential Dutch East Indies port of Batavia, the present-day Indonesian capital of Jakarta, as they waited for transport to Britain.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePatients with cystic {{fibrosis}} have increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant systems. Moderate intake of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may favor the lowering of oxidative stress.

After 9 weeks of wash-out, patients took placebo or DHA capsules. Biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and vitamin E were measured at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment in each phase.

40|$|Objective: Some {{patients}} with schizophrenia may need mirtazapine augmentation to improve negative and cognitive symptoms. However {{there have been}} a few studies about the tolerability of mirtazapine augmentation to antipsychotics such as akathisia, extrapyramydal symptoms, weight gain, and body mass index (BMI). Methods: This study was an eight-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mirtazapine augmentation to risperidone. Twenty-one stabilized participants diagnosed with schizophrenia and undergoing treatment with risperidone were randomized to adjunctive treatment with mirtazapine (15 mg/day for the first two weeks, 30 mg/day for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> six <b>weeks)</b> <b>or</b> placebo. Eleven patients were assigned to the mirtazapine group, and nine patients were given placebo. Results: There was no significant difference between the mirtazapine and placebo groups with respect to Barnes Akathisia rating Scale (BAS) and Sympsom-Angus Scale (SAS). However, the mirtazapine group exhibited a statistically significant increase in weight and BMI (p＜ 0. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest that mirtazapine augmentation can be tolerable in schizophrenic patients treated with risper-idone; however, we should pay attention to the weight gain with mirtazapine. Our results should be replicated in a large-scale lengthy trial...|$|R

He and Warner did not file suit against Paramount, largely because Straczynski didn't see it as a productive option, with negative repercussions for both TV series.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{decaffeinated}} versus regular coffee on {{blood pressure and}} heart rate was investigated. In a randomized double-blind, crossover trial, 45 healthy volunteers (23 women and 22 men, 25 - 45 years old) with a habitual intake of 4 - 6 cups coffee/day received 5 cups of regular coffee each day {{for a period of}} 6 weeks, and 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> vice versa. The background diet was kept constant. The total amount of caffeine ingested was 40 mg during the decaffeinated coffee period and 445 mg during the regular coffee period. Use of decaffeinated coffee led to a significant but small decrease in systolic (mean +/- SEM, - 1. 5 +/- 0. 4 mm Hg; p = 0. 002) and diastolic (- 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 mm Hg; p = 0. 017) ambulant blood pressure and to a small increase in ambulant heart rate (+ 1. 3 +/- 0. 6 beats/min; p = 0. 031). Individual differences in rate of caffeine metabolism did not explain differences in long-term response of blood pressure to caffeine. We conclude that in normotensive adults replacement of regular by decaffeinated coffee leads to a real but small fall in blood pressure. However, it remains to be established whether a mass switch from regular to decaffeinated coffee would significantly reduce the total incidence of hypertension-related disorders...|$|R

60|$|It is a {{remarkable}} circumstance, that different trades appear to partake of the disease to which elephants and dogs are especially liable, and to run stark, staring, raving mad, periodically. The great distinction between the animals and the trades, is, that the former run mad with {{a certain degree of}} propriety—they are very regular in their irregularities. We know the period at which the emergency will arise, and provide against it accordingly. If an elephant run mad, we are all ready for him—kill or cure—pills or bullets, calomel in conserve of roses, or lead in a musket-barrel. If a dog happen to look unpleasantly warm in the summer months, and to trot about the shady side of the streets with a quarter of a yard of tongue hanging out of his mouth, a thick leather muzzle, which has been previously prepared in compliance with the thoughtful injunctions of the Legislature, is instantly clapped over his head, by way of making him cooler, and he either looks remarkably unhappy for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> six <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> becomes legally insane, and goes mad, as it were, by Act of Parliament.
