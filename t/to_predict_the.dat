5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible <b>to</b> <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many {{theories}} in cognitive psychology assume that per-ception and action systems are clearly {{separated from the}} cognitive system. Other theories suggest that important cognitive functions re-side in the interactions between these systems. One consequence of the latter claim is that the action system may contribute <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> future consequences of currently perceived actions. In particular, such predictions might be more accurate when one observes one’s own ac-tions than when one observes another person’s actions, because in the former case the system that plans the action is the same system that contributes <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> action’s effects.

50|$|A {{knowledge}} of environmental soil chemistry is paramount <b>to</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> fate of contaminants, {{as well as}} the processes by which they are initially released into the soil. Once a chemical is exposed to the soil environment myriad chemical reactions can occur that may increase or decrease contaminant toxicity.
