5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and {{equal protection of}} the law, though not the right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills.

5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866, or {{to ensure that no}} subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. <b>The</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau {{enforced}} {{the amendment}} locally, providing {{a degree of}} support for people subject to the Black Codes. Reciprocally, the Thirteenth Amendment established the Bureau's legal basis to operate in Kentucky. <b>The</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> circumvented racism in local jurisdictions by allowing blacks access to the federal courts. The Enforcement Acts of 1870–1871 and <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1875, in combating the violence and intimidation of white supremacy, were {{also part of the}} effort to end slave conditions for Southern blacks. However, the effect of these laws waned as political will diminished and the federal government lost authority in the South, particularly after the Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction in exchange for a Republican presidency.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{campaign}} successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, sit-ins, pickets, and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until passage of <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964, which ended overt, legally sanctioned segregation nationwide.

5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to pass <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action {{by a state}} to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the States had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Although Wilson's bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson's veto on April 9, 1866.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. <b>The</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E
5|$|U. S. v. Rhodes (1866), one of {{the first}} Thirteenth Amendment cases, tested the Constitutionality of {{provisions}} in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1866 that granted blacks redress in the federal courts. Kentucky law prohibited blacks from testifying against whites—an arrangement which compromised the ability of Nancy Talbot ("a citizen of the United States of the African race") to reach justice against a white person accused of robbing her. After Talbot attempted to try the case in federal court, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled this federal option unconstitutional. Noah Swayne (a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Kentucky Circuit Court) overturned the Kentucky decision, holding that without the material enforcement provided by <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> slavery would not truly be abolished. With In Re Turner (1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase ordered freedom for Elizabeth Turner, a former slave in Maryland who became indentured to her former master.|$|E

5|$|The Birmingham {{campaign}} {{was a model}} of nonviolent direct action protest and, through the media, drew the world's attention to racial segregation in the South.

5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional {{passage of}} <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans.

Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.|$|E
