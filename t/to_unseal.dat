5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how <b>to</b> <b>unseal</b> the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E

Water was taken from the well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.|$|E

Access from the north of Mittagong is via Mittagong, while access from the south is via the half {{interchange}} {{at the southern end}} of the Mittagong Bypass section of the Hume Highway. It passes through farmland and the locality of High Range as a sealed road. Further west, it changes <b>to</b> <b>unsealed</b> and continues through farmland before entering the Wombeyan Caves area. The road conditions deteriorate substantially as the road goes further west until it reaches the main Wombeyan Caves reserve camping area. West of the camping area, the road is sealed as it climbs a tight, winding section up the mountain side. At the top of that hill, the road reverts <b>to</b> <b>unsealed</b> but is wider and straighter. Close to its western end, the road is a reasonable standard sealed road.|$|R

The Dungeon consists {{of a series of}} enemy-filled corridors which are found during exploration of the Labyrinth. The player's objective in the Dungeon is to progress through each corridor and defeat the boss at the end. Upon completion, the player destroys the corridor and is returned to the Labyrinth, where a power-up (and sometimes a warp panel key) is collected as a reward. While some corridors can be accessed freely, others can only be entered by performing a particular action in the corridor room. Some rooms in the Labyrinth contain clues that indicate how <b>to</b> <b>unseal</b> these corridors.

500|$|Although {{his efforts}} dealing with video games have {{generally}} focused on juveniles, Thompson {{got involved in}} a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant {{in a series of}} highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court <b>to</b> <b>unseal</b> a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the [...] "functional equivalent of a 15-year-old," [...] and [...] "the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense".|$|E

He had been using his life force to power the undercity of New New York, which was sealed {{off from the rest}} of the planet to save the only survivors from the now-extinct virus. The Face of Boe needed the Doctor's help to free the people from the undercity, and he uses the last of his life energy to provide a power boost <b>to</b> <b>unseal</b> the exits. As was foretold in legend, initially introduced in spin-off media, the sky (of the undercity) splits asunder just before the Face of Boe dies. In his final moments, the Face of Boe reveals his great secret to the Doctor: [...] "You are not alone."

[...] However, Chase didn't report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it told the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency that the performance of Madoff's investments was [...] "too good to be true." [...] The suit also claimed that Chase bankers were making profitable deals with Madoff even as risk management executives expressed concern about the nature of Madoff's business. [...] It also claimed that Chase officials knew that Friehling & Horowitz wasn't peer reviewed or registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (it subsequently emerged that the Friehling firm had stated in writing {{for more than a decade}} that it didn't conduct audits). [...] Almost as seriously, Picard charged that Chemical/Chase's retail bankers failed to perform even basic oversight of Madoff's banking activities, despite several transactions dating as far back as the 1990s that raised the appearance of money laundering or check kiting. [...] Picard argued that even a cursory glance at Madoff's account activity at Chase would have revealed his business could not possibly have been legitimate. [...] He also argued that even after Chase reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, it didn't put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.|$|E
