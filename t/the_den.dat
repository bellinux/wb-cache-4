Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and <b>the</b> <b>den</b> is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share <b>the</b> <b>den</b> with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers, or because they have survived capture.|$|E
5|$|Millwall {{moved to}} a new stadium, named <b>The</b> <b>Den,</b> in New Cross, South London in 1910. The club had {{previously}} occupied four different grounds in the 25 years since their formation in East London; limited expansion space on the Isle of Dogs meant The Lions had to move to boost support and attendances. The estimated cost of <b>The</b> <b>Den</b> was £10,000. The first match played at the new ground was on 22 October 1910 against reigning Southern League champions Brighton & Hove Albion, who won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1910, Millwall {{crossed the}} river to South London, moving to Cold Blow Lane in New Cross. The fifth ground was called <b>The</b> <b>Den,</b> built {{at a cost of}} £10,000 by noted {{football}} ground architect Archibald Leitch. The first game played there was against Brighton & Hove Albion, which Brighton won 1–0. Millwall remained there for 83 years, until moving to their sixth and current ground, at first known as The New Den but now called simply <b>The</b> <b>Den,</b> on 4 August 1993. The ground has an all-seated capacity of 20,146. A Sporting Lisbon team, managed by Bobby Robson helped open the ground by playing a friendly, which The Lions lost 2–1.|$|E

50|$|The {{distances}} between <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> and surrounding structures are also key features that can suggest the diagnosis, with the normal distance between <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> and basion (BDI) measuring less than 9 mm on CT, {{and the distance}} between <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> and atlas (ADI) measuring less than 3 mm on CT, although this can be increased in cases of rheumatoid arthritis due to pannus formation. Lastly, the atlanto-occipital interval can be measured.|$|R
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. <b>The</b> <b>den</b> is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should <b>the</b> <b>den</b> be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
5|$|Millwall, who had {{now also}} dropped 'Athletic' from its name, {{were invited to}} join the Football League in 1920 for the 1920–21 season, along with 22 other clubs, through the {{creation}} of the new Football League Third Division. The Southern League was shorn of its status, with almost all its clubs deciding to leave—Millwall followed suit. Millwall's first Football League match was on 28 August 1920 at <b>The</b> <b>Den,</b> and they were 2–0 winners against Bristol Rovers.|$|E

5|$|The loss of so {{many young}} men during the Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. <b>The</b> <b>Den</b> sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to <b>The</b> <b>Den,</b> to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club was fighting for Third Division survival.|$|E

5|$|Facing continual {{threats from}} the Acrocanthosaurus, Red, {{her sister and}} the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They {{encounter}} ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning <b>the</b> <b>den</b> into their nest. The older chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; the older chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing the weakness of the Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Millwall won the Second Division {{championship}} and gained promotion, joining West Ham in the First Division {{for the first}} time in the club's history. Paul Ince scored the only goal at <b>The</b> <b>Den</b> on 3 December 1988, as West Ham won the game 1–0. They also won 3–0 at home on 22 April 1989, with goals from Julian Dicks, George Parris and Alan Dickens. This is the first and only time either side has completed a Football League double over the other. At the end of the season West Ham finished 19th and were relegated. Millwall finished 10th, the highest league finish in their history. The 1988–89 season is the only season both teams have been in the top division of English football. Millwall were relegated from the First Division in the 1989–90 season, the last time they appeared in the top tier. During the foundation of the Premier League in 1992, the two teams competed the tier below in the newly formed First Division. The last game played between the teams at <b>The</b> <b>Den</b> was on 15 November 1992. It was the featured Sunday game on The London Match, an LWT sports show. Millwall won the game 2–1, with goals from Malcolm Allen and Phil Barber. Mark Robson replied for West Ham.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave <b>the</b> <b>den</b> to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|The river otter, {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. <b>The</b> <b>den</b> typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside <b>the</b> <b>den</b> with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

40|$|Peripheral {{quantitative}} {{computed tomography}} scans of the axis in 20 fresh cadaveric specimens obtained at autopsy were studied {{to investigate the}} internal structural properties of the axis. In all specimens, serial scans were done in three planes. The area of <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> consisted of dense cortical and trabecular bone (Region 1, above the base of <b>the</b> <b>dens)</b> and showed statistically significantly greater peripheral quantitative computed tomography values {{when compared with the}} anterior part of the body of the axis (Region 2, below the base of <b>the</b> <b>dens).</b> An age-related progressive decrease of peripheral quantitative computed tomography values was observed, with specimens from subjects younger than 40 years showing statistically significantly greater peripheral quantitative computed tomography values when compared with those from subjects older than 40 years. A small area of trabecular bone with decreased density was found close to the anteroinferior edge of the body of the axis in the specimens from younger subjects. In contrast, a large area of trabecular bone with decreased density extending anteroinferiorly to superoposteriorly to the base of <b>the</b> <b>dens</b> was found in the specimens from older subjects. Based on these findings, we think that dens fracture classification systems and fixation techniques-should be reconsidered...|$|R

5|$|Barry Kitchener {{holds the}} record for Millwall appearances, having played 596 matches between 1966 and 1982. The goalscoring record is held by Neil Harris, with 138 in all competitions. He broke the {{previous}} record of 111 goals, held by Teddy Sheringham on 13 January 2009, during a 3–2 away win at Crewe Alexandra. The club's widest victory margin in the league is 9–1, a scoreline which they achieved twice in their Football League Third Division South championship-winning year of 1927. They beat both Torquay United and Coventry City by this score at <b>The</b> <b>Den.</b> Millwall's heaviest league defeat was 8–1 away to Plymouth Argyle in 1932. The club's heaviest loss in all competitions was a 9–1 defeat at Aston Villa in an FA Cup fourth-round second-leg in 1946. Millwall's largest Cup win was 7–0 over Gateshead in 1936. Their highest scoring aggregate game was a 12-goal thriller at home to Preston North End in 1930 when Millwall lost 7–5.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing <b>the</b> <b>den</b> on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 1938, 42,200 spectators at Upton Park saw a Second Division {{game between}} the sides end 0–0. , this remains the record {{attendance}} for the fixture. Between 1939 and 1946 the two clubs played non-competitive fixtures in the League South (A) Division, South Regional League, London League, Football League South and the Football League War Cup. They played 19 games against each other during the Second World War: Millwall won 3, West Ham 12 and 4 were drawn. <b>The</b> <b>Den</b> was severely damaged by a German bomb in 1943, and {{for a brief time}} Millwall were invited by their neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham to play their games at The Valley, Selhurst Park and Upton Park. To offset the shortage of professional players during the Second World War, a guest player system was introduced. Players such as Sailor Brown, Louis Cardwell and Jimmy Jinks played for both clubs during this period. West Ham lost 2–1 to Chelsea at White Hart Lane in the 1944–45 War Time Cup semi-final, with two Millwall guest-players in their team– both of whom went on to play for Millwall in the South Final, which they lost to Chelsea 2–0.|$|E
