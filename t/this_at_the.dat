5|$|Amid renewed rumours of an {{impending}} Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London {{at the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{and again}} in 1970, Wilton {{recommended}} {{the creation of a}} single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the Liberals in the December 1972 Federal election. The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.|$|E

5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{remains of}} each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate <b>this.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to reduce the weight of the head. The short, tall skulls of woolly and Columbian mammoths are the culmination of this process.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Claxton Shield was contested {{between five}} teams from around Australia. In {{previous}} years, {{many of the}} teams had played their home games at multiple venues. This season each team held their home games at only one venue. There was one scheduled exception to <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the season: the New South Wales Patriots' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval, whereas all of their other home games were held at Blacktown Baseball Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of <b>this,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of its release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for riskâ€”particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of his death ten years later.|$|E

5|$|While with Doenia Bergerak, Kartodikromo {{wrote an}} attack on the Dutch Advisor on Native Affairs R.A. Rinkes; in his editorial, he wrote that the Dutch loved {{themselves}} far more than the natives they were subjugating. On 26 January 1915, Kartodikromo came under investigation by the Justice Office of the Dutch East Indies for publishing several further anti-Dutch editorials. The journalist unsuccessfully attempted to raise money to protest <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Dutch parliament in The Hague. He was convicted of revolutionary activity and sentenced to nine months at Mlaten Prison; however, due to public outcry he was released after 100 days. When Doenia Bergerak went bankrupt, Kartodipuro then headed the Saro Tomo.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883. The current weatherboard town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to <b>this.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water. It relied on wells, rainwater and the inconstant river.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E

5|$|In January1975, Caltrans {{presented}} {{plans to}} realign SR76 away from Mission Avenue {{and move it}} to {{the south side of}} the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After <b>this,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the environmental impact report. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.|$|E
5|$|That year Clements and Musker {{expanded}} the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating {{the role of}} the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Oliver & Company as more immediate releases. In 1987, songwriter Howard Ashman became involved with the writing and development of Mermaid after he was asked to contribute a song to Oliver & Company. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect <b>this.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make Mermaid a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film. Ashman and composer Alan Menken, both noted for their work as the writers of the successful Off-Broadway stage musical Little Shop of Horrors, teamed up to compose the entire song score. In 1988, with Oliver out of the way, Mermaid was slated as the next major Disney release.|$|E
