50|$|In 1993, Edelstein was {{recruited}} by Thomson Financial, {{which was in}} the early stages of developing straight-through processing systems for equity market investors. He was named president and CEO of its newly established post-trade processing business, Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group. In that role, Edelstein eventually succeeded in securing an SEC ruling to overturn a longstanding New York Stock Exchange rule that had given the Depository Trust & Clearing Company (“DTCC”) a monopoly on equity trade confirmation services. Thomson’s electronic network replaced the industry’s paper-based processes to enable speedy, efficient, straight-through transaction processing. In 2000, the Boston Globe estimated that Edelstein's Thomson Financial Electronic Settlements Group was responsible for processing one third of the world's daily stock transactions. A year later, Edelstein orchestrated the merger of Thomson's trade confirmation business with a subsidiary of the DTCC to create the new company, Omgeo, which was the first commercial provider of such services. In 2003, Edelstein became president and CEO of Radianz, a joint venture of Reuters and Equant that operated a financial industry <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platform.</b> The company had not yet turned a profit at the time, and Edelstein redefined the Equant's mandate to embrace an early version of cloud computing.

40|$|The {{trends in}} todays tele- and datacommunication market point toward using IP {{for all sorts}} of service {{delivery}} ranging from voice calls to TV. The next natural step in this evolution is to provide the same set of services to the end users independent of the access technology and device used. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is an IP based <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platform</b> which targets this and lets the operators develop new services once which can then be used on many different devices. This thesis examines the integration of IPTV and IMS. Can IMS be used to deliver TV services and can the IPTV set-top-boxes of today be used as clients in IMS? Since this is a new and previously unexamined area an explorative approach is taken. The aim is to identify how such an integration could be performed and the possible problems which have to be solved. To assist in this exploration a TV-push service based on IMS technology is constructed. Based on the experiences from this service a general architecture for IPTV in IMS is suggested. A number of problems crucial to solve for a successful integration are identified and possible solutions to these are discussed...|$|E

These candidate designs may all be feasible, but they will likely have different attributes in several dimensions, such as technical performance, risk, costs, etc. The designers must then trade off design choices for the platform and the variants to determine an adequate overall family result.

40|$|Large volume {{processes}} {{within the}} aerospace industry, such as final wing build or telecommunications spacecraft integration, are commonly {{at the mercy}} of challenging assembly tolerances that require modern metrology instruments to be successfully realised. Holistic capability models for widely used instruments such as the laser tracker and photogrammetry systems are not currently utilised within the early stage design phases to aid tolerance design. The goal of the work presented within this thesis was to create, test and prove a set of design guidelines for the aerospace industry titled ‘Design for Verification’ that consider estimated measurement uncertainty within the early design stages when {{there is a lack of}} historical data to adequately inform simulation based design. The guidelines were created to inform design engineers within low rate, high value manufacturing industries, where process capability data are unattainable, to set realistic and achievable tolerances whereby ensuring product conformance and measurability. This was achieved by introducing an additional parameter to the widely established Design for X toolbox, Design for Verification. The focus of Design for Verification is primarily upon the use of metrology and how it impacts large volume assemblies in modern aerospace manufacturing. The Design for Verification guidelines were created with the key objectives of promoting assembly process optimisation, product conformance and reduced cost. The DfV guidelines were applied to an existing product, detailing existing processes in order to baseline a process for comparing the guidelines against. The DfV guidelines were then applied to the same product to demonstrate how they should be used within the early design phase and the results of before and after implementation of the guidelines were compared. A physical demonstrator was designed around the existing Eurostar 3000 telecommunications satellite platform, from Airbus Defence and Space, to test the proposals and design changes derived through following the Design for Verification guidelines. Application of the Design for Verification guidelines resulted in: reduced measurement uncertainty, optimised assembly sequencing, improved tooling design, informed tolerance synthesis and analysis and advanced metrology processes. This has resulted in direct cost benefits for the Airbus Defence and Space <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platform</b> with an estimated saving of 20 % for the next generation NEOSAT spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{inclusion}} {{policy has}} been ignited globally {{by the rise of}} money transfer services over mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platforms.</b> Explanations for the success of the leading example in Kenya have focussed on conditions of supply side development and the demand for domestic urban to rural remittances. This paper investigates this phenomenon by examining the financial practices of low income people and in particular the social relational dimensions of debt that underlie these mobile money transactions. By contrasting the social relations involved in mobile money to those of informal groups and banks which are the next most used services, this evidence highlights a 'fiduciary culture' in which relationships of equality and 'negotiability' dominate and which are seamlessly facilitated by mobile money in contrast to relations with banks which tend towards relations of hierarchy. I argue that this reveals a competing emic vision that questions policy makers expectations that mobile money transfer will itself seamlessly facilitate engagement with the formal sector for savings and credit...|$|R
40|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} the competition among <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platforms</b> that demands deregulation is not ubiquitously effective, I endorse and expatiate on the objective 'bright line' test proposed by the Canadian company TELUS for determining when and within what geographic market boundaries to deregulate. In accordance with that test, I then discuss the nature of the antitrust policy upon which falls responsibility for preserving the competition that is the logical surrogate for direct regulation. Following the rule of reason prescribed by the United States Supreme Court 95 years ago, I would have that policy concentrate on the behavior of the incumbent access providers and the intent that may logically be inferred from it. Finally, applying the two preceding expositions to the highly politically charged, largely ideological demands for a legislatively imposed rule of "network neutrality," I contend that if the two previously recommended policies are followed, such a legislative mandate would be both supererogatory and counterproductive.

Although these solvers are commonly used for space vehicles and space launchers for trajectory optimization, few experimental papers exist on optimal control of small airships. The objective of this thesis is {{to evaluate the use}} of a pseudo-spectral optimal control solver for generating dynamically constrained, minimal time trajectories. A dynamical model of a small airship is presented, with its experimental virtual mass, drag and motor experimentally modeled. The problems are solved in PSOPT, a pseudo-spectral optimal control code. Experimental tests with a small scale model are performed to evaluate the generated paths. Although drift occurs, as a consequence of an open loop control, the vehicle is capable of following the path. This results of this thesis may find uses in verifying how close to optimal discreet path planners are, to plan complex trajectories on short distances, or to generate dynamic maneuverer such as take-off or landing. Ultimately, improving path planning of small airships will improve their safety, maneuverability and flight-time, which makes them fit for scientific monitoring, for search and rescue, or as mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
