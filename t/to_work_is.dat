25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep on the way <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> attractive to many commuters using public transport.|$|E

In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E

25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E

500|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review, though {{he gave it}} a 2.5star (out of 4) rating. While he positively called Gaga's performances outrageous and [...] "occasionally fierce", he questioned Gaga's authenticity, both on stage and in the pre-concert scenes. Ultimately, he wrote, [...] "Unsurprisingly, HBO's Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden raises more questions about Stefani Germanotta (Gaga's birth name) than it answers, which is probably as it should be." [...] Radio host Howard Stern also compared the black-and-white scenes of the special to Madonna: Truth or Dare, adding that when he darts a glance at Lady Gaga, she is occasionally registered in his brain as Madonna. On his show, Stern was also critical of inappropriateness and unreasonability of the numerous speeches Gaga gave between the songs in the special, calling them [...] "", [...] "drivel", and [...] "condescending". Dedicating over {{half an hour of}} his show on May 9 and 10, 2011, to express his criticism of the concert, Stern compared the manner of Gaga's speaking to professional wrestling due to echoing, Gaga's gasping between the words, and the audience's arguable inability to hear the words enough to understand them. In particular, Gaga claimed in the concert that her incentive <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>is</b> to [...] "set [...] free", not money. Stern attempted to debunk that claim by arguing that Gaga takes potentially psychiatric problems of her audience lightly by urging her fans to [...] "forget all of [...] insecurities" [...] overnight.|$|E

Results: Twenty-one occupational physicians followed 54, 026 employees. The all-cause incidence of being unfit <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> 0. 772 %.
