500|$|All {{the while}} {{plans to build}} a new Reich {{chancellery}} had been underway since 1934. Land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at Voßstraße. Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. He had been commissioned to renovate the Borsig Palace on the corner of Voßstraße and Wilhelmstraße as a headquarter for the SA, who were about to be relocated from Munich to Berlin {{in the aftermath of the}} Röhm purge. and completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by May1936. In June 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30,000 Reichsmark and estimated that the chancellery would be completed within three to four years. Detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on 1January1938. On 27January1938 Speer received plenipotentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancellery by 1January1939. Yet for propagandistic reasons, to prove the vigor and organizational skills of National Socialism, Hitler claimed during the topping-out ceremony on 2August1938 that he had ordered Speer to build the new chancellery just that year. Speer reiterated this claim in his memoirs to show that he had been up to <b>that</b> <b>supposed</b> challenge, and some of his biographers, most notably Joachim Fest, have followed that account. The building itself, hailed by Hitler as the [...] "crowning glory of the greater German political empire", was designed as a theatrical set for representation, [...] "to intimidate and humiliate", as historian Martin Kitchen puts it. Because of shortages of labor, the construction workers had to work in two ten- to twelve-hour shifts to have the chancellery completed by early January 1939.|$|E
