You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

"Kicking {{off with}} a deliciously angry grunt that plays on loop (UHH!!!) the Shellback-produced track finds Lloyd ruing the day she ever stepped out on her man…who’s now being made all the happier by some other chick: 'Remember all the things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did first? And now you’re doing them with her?!' Lloyd sings incredulously on the {{bouncing}} electro-pop beat, dissing the chick’s jeans and denying all charges of jealousy in the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2015, {{following}} {{the onset of}} the Cuban Thaw, O'Brien became the first American television personality to film in Cuba {{for more than half a}} century. Conan O'Brien then visited Armenia. In April 2016, O'Brien visited South Korea in response to a fan letter urging him to visit, as well as a growing fan base online. His visit included a trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, which resulted in O'Brien and Steven Yeun to also 'visit' North Korea by stepping across the border line at the DMZ. Conan commented on the significance during the sketch, claiming, [...] "The idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could be in North Korea, talking and communicating freely, seems like kind of a cool message." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not quite; but I {{have got}} {{the fact that there}} is a mystery. She told me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> and she herself ought not to be here. When I asked her why, she said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ought to be gentlemen and that she ought to be a lady. I told her <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were gentlemen, in spite of our trousers. [...] "Ah," [...] she said, [...] "there comes the difference; I'm not a lady any longer!" [...] When I contradicted her she snubbed me, and said that I hadn't seen enough of the world to know {{anything}} about it. But I'll have it all out of her before I've done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Violet, [...] "you {{are very}} generous. After all, <b>I</b> {{expected}} <b>that</b> from <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{think it will}} not hurt you very much to give me up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vanderbank, {{in quick}} response, called it up. [...] "Dear yes--wasn't it charming? <b>And</b> <b>that</b> morning <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> spent there"--he was so careful {{to be easy}} about it--"talking under the trees." ...|$|R
