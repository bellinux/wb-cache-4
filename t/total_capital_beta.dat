The NRR is illustrated with a case study of the New England multispecies groundfish fishery, showing how ignorance by managers of tolal capital components (i. e. social, economic, cultural, human, biophysical) significantly destabilized the fishery. A NRR approach to marine policy and management is anticipated to improve the sustainability of both natural resources and natural-resource dependent communities.

40|$|Background : The Health through Sport {{conceptual}} model links sport participation with physical, {{social and psychological}} outcomes and stresses {{the need for more}} understanding between these outcomes. The present study aims to uncover how sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health are interrelated by examining these outcomes in one model. Methods : A cross-sectional survey was conducted in nine disadvantaged communities in Antwerp (Belgium). Two hundred adults (aged 18 - 56) per community were randomly selected and visited at home to fill out a questionnaire on socio-demographics, sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health. A sample of 414 adults participated in the study. Results : Structural Equation Modeling analysis showed that sport participation (beta =. 095) and not total physical activity (beta =. 027) was associated with better mental health. No association was found between sport participation and community social <b>capital</b> (<b>beta</b> =. 009) or individual social <b>capital</b> (<b>beta</b> =. 045). Furthermore, only community social capital was linked with physical activity (beta =. 114), individual social <b>capital</b> was not (<b>beta</b> = -. 013). In contrast, only individual social capital was directly associated with mental health (beta =. 152), community social <b>capital</b> was not (<b>beta</b> =. 070). Conclusion : This study emphasizes the importance of sport participation and individual social capital to improve mental health in disadvantaged communities. It further gives a unique insight into the functionalities of how sport participation, physical activity, social capital and mental health are interrelated. Implications for policy are that cross-sector initiatives between the sport, social and health sector need to be supported as their outcomes are directly linked to one another...|$|R

Faster growth in annual gross investment in commercial software {{is necessary in}} Mexico to promote faster development of the country’s information technology (IT) infrastructure, increase <b>total</b> IT <b>capital,</b> stimulate employment growth, and increase gross domestic product (GDP). In order to more aggressively stimulate the economy, governments should target policies to enhance {{the growth of a}} commercial software industry. Major Findings: • A direct correlation exists between investment in IT infrastructure and economic performance; the economies of countries where IT investments represent greater than 7. 5 percent of <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> investments far outperform the economies of countries where investment in IT infrastructure represents less than 2. 1 percent of <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> outlays. • Mexico is under invested in IT capital. IT capital as a share of <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> is 1. 5 percent. • The mix of investments in countries with low levels of IT investment differs from the mix found in countries with high levels of IT investment. Currently, in countries with low levels of IT investment, most of the annual investment is in hardware (62. 2 percent) and least is in commercial software (13. 3 percent) ...|$|R
