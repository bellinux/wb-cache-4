40|$|The mode of {{road freight}} {{transportation}} changes from single vehicle transport to drop and pull transport. The efficiency, safety, {{and reliability of}} coupling between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers {{is the key to}} developing drop and pull transport. Some technical clauses of standards on connection between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers are not suitable requirements for drop and pull transport, and application status is not optimistic. This paper puts forward some suggestions based on analysis of articulated vehicle dimensions, interchangeability between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers, electrical and pneumatic connector, fifth wheel kingpin, <b>trailer</b> landing <b>gears,</b> and so on, that would provide a reference to revise the relevant standards.

40|$|LNG is the {{abbreviation}} for liquefied natural gas, which {{is recognized as}} one of the world’s clean energies. LNG is one product at natural gas that through purification and ultra-low temperature is liquefied. The liquefied natural gas is very suitable for LNG transportation by a truck. China is a big country rich in natural resources. The use of natural gas is in favor of Chinese energy structure adjustment. It has important strategic significance to improve the ecological environment and the quality of people’s lives. A LNG carrier vehicle is a cryogenic liquid tanker truck used to transport liquefied natural gas in an ultra-low temperature environment. Because LNG is flammable, explosive, and cryogenic and so on, it is very important the safety design of LNG carrier vehicle demanded in the road transport safety. LNG carrier vehicles usually consist of LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks, <b>trailer</b> running <b>gears,</b> piping systems, a control box and other components. Among them prone to accidents are mainly LNG cryogenic liquid storage tanks and safety accessories. This paper dealt with the safety design research to these two systems.

40|$|Introduction: Tractor {{drivers are}} {{continuously}} exposed to whole body vibration during driving that, this may cause disorders {{in the system}} of musculoskeletal, nervous, circulatory and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate exposed to whole body vibration among tractor driver.. Material and Method: In this study, whole-body vibration parameters such as root mean square (rms) of acceleration, total equivalent acceleration, vibration dose value (VDV) and crest factor (CF) were separately compared in three directions (x, y, and z), in 3 Massey Ferguson Model 165 Tractor it was done during 3 different modes of transport (without trailer, with empty trailer and with a trailer load of soil), plowing the land and loading trailer in working conditions with various gear according to the guidelines of ISO 2631 standard.. Result: The results showed that in all measuring points, exposure to whole body vibration was higher than permissible level and the risks of disorders exist. Exposure to vibration were as with empty trailer (43. 11 m/s 2). The maximum of crest factor was obtained for transportation mode of empty <b>trailer</b> with 3 <b>gear</b> (10. 7), then plowing (7. 35) and loading soil(6. 50). The maximum of vibration dose value was eventuated for transportation mode with empty <b>trailer</b> with 4 <b>gear</b> (189. 92 m/s 1. 75) and 3 gear (108. 15 m/s 1. 75). In all measuring modes exposure with vibration in Y direction was greater than X and Z axes.. Conclusion: This study shows that the need to provide intervention, controlling and managing measures to eliminate or reduce exposure to whole body vibration among tractor drivers its necessary. And, preventing main disorder Including musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and early fatigue is of circular importance. More studies are also necessary to identify the sources of vibration among various of tractors...|$|R
5000|$|Although Raiden {{does not}} appear in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, his {{character}} is the subject of parody throughout the game by debuting character Raikov. Raiden also appears in an early promotional <b>trailer</b> for Metal <b>Gear</b> Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, fighting for control of the franchise with Solid Snake in a series of comic scenes. A sequel to the trailer was produced entitled [...] "Metal Gear Raiden: Snake Eraser" [...] in which Raiden travels to the past to assassinate Big Boss but fails comically. In the trailer's English version, Raiden was voiced by Charlie Schlatter (the voice actor for Raikov) instead of Quinton Flynn. Raiden's Metal Gear Solid 2 version appears in the Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus expansion pack, where he is an unlockable character. His Metal Gear Solid 4 incarnation appears as a playable character in Metal Gear Online.|$|R
500|$|The VR {{training}} mode {{from the}} original Metal Gear Solid has been expanded into 300 stages, which are now stored on a separate third disc known as the [...] "VR Disc". These new set of missions are divided into four main categories: Sneaking, Weapons, Advanced and Special. The first three categories feature standard training exercises that tests the player's sneaking, shooting and combat skills, while the fourth category contains less conventional tests involving murder mysteries, giant genome soldiers and flying saucers. One particular set of missions has the player controlling the Cyborg Ninja, unlocked by either completing a minigame on the PocketStation and uploading the data to the VR Disc or by achieving the Fox rank on the main game. Completing all 300 missions will unlock a concept artwork of Metal Gear RAY, a mech that would later appear in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Additional content include preview <b>trailers</b> of Metal <b>Gear</b> Solid from trade events and a photoshoot mode where the player can take photographs of fully expressive polygonal models of Mei Ling and Dr. Naomi after completing the main game. Famitsu magazine rated Metal Gear Solid: Integral a 34 out of 40.|$|R
5000|$|On August 6, 2010, {{the first}} Top <b>Gear</b> <b>trailer</b> was {{published}} on the web, giving fans a preview on what to expect on the upcoming episodes to be broadcast on the History Channel. In this trailer, new hosts Adam Ferrara, Tanner Foust, and Rutledge Wood were seen participating in a Moonshine Challenge and Tanner Foust also takes a Dodge Viper for a test drive. The first season premiered on November 21, 2010, and as of 2014, the series has been renewed for its fifth season. Commenting on the second season renewal, UK host Jeremy Clarkson noted, [...] "Top Gear is our baby so {{you can understand why}} Hammond, May and I were anxious about passing it on to the presenters of the US show. We needn’t have worried because Top Gear is clearly in safe hands, even if they do insist on speaking in those stupid accents. Watching an episode from series 1 with Richard and James, we found ourselves in a genuinely heated debate about which of the presenters’ cars was best. We were just three ordinary chaps watching a car show and loving it, which is exactly what Top Gear should be. Bring on series 2." ...|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>trailer</b> for Guilty <b>Gear</b> Xrd -Sign- {{was shown}} to the public during the annual Arc System Works Festival on May 19, 2013. The trailer {{demonstrated}} the 3D cel-shaded graphics—modeled by Softimage—being used {{in place of the}} series traditional 2D sprites. The game was projected to be visually impacting as a way to attract new players and because of Ishiwatari's guess that it was a fundamental factor on the success of games like Street Fighter 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. 3D camera cutaways, which gives [...] "a more dramatic perspective", were added on the special move scenes to help reach this purpose. However, this cinematic moves in which the camera orbit the scene required the background objects to be modeled 360 degree. [...] Because of this rotation, special effects such as smoke should be convincing in 3D; so they modeled it with meshs. The objects also had to be scaled down or deformed to give the impression they are far from when they are. Designers did that because if they were actually placed in a far depth, their horizontal movement would seem to be motionless. In contrast, cutscene backgrounds and distant characters in the stages are billboards. Each scene has 160 MB in textures and 70-80 different shaders on it. Each character model uses around 400 to 600 bones, along with significant use of scale animation.|$|R
500|$|Raiden's {{replacement}} of fan favorite Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2 proved controversial, and GamesRadar considered the event {{a reason to}} dislike the series overall. The same site criticized his role in Metal Gear Solid 2 several times, and called his inclusion {{one of the worst}} aspects of the game. In 2004, GameAxis Unwired published a fake interview in which Hideo Kojima expressed regret for creating the character. While calling Metal Gear Solid 2 one of the biggest disappointments in video-game history, UGO Networks' Marissa Meli cited Raiden's debut as a key problem with the game. Meli also commented on Raiden's design, placing him 12th in a list of the most androgynous video game characters. The book Playing with Videogames states that Raiden's inclusion was to surprise Metal Gear fans who, instead of playing as Snake, played as his opposite. Writer James Newman commented that fans' reactions were highly negative, as though their expectations had been [...] "betray" [...] by Kojima. He compared Raiden to the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks. <b>Trailers</b> for Metal <b>Gear</b> Solid 3: Snake Eater (in which Raiden is mocked) were considered by Newman to be Konami's comic response to fans' disapproval. Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan, with Yoji Shinkawa commenting it was because he matched the stereotype of manga hero. In 2012, manga artist Hiro Mashima drew an illustration of Raiden in anticipation of the series' following games. He mentioned having had difficulties illustrating the character.|$|R
