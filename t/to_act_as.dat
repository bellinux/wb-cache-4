5|$|As the {{celebrations}} {{in honor of}} Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began {{to consider the possibility}} of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.|$|E
