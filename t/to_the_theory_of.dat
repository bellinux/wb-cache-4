5|$|As Eddington {{pointed out}} in 1924, densities of this order implied that, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> general relativity, the light from Sirius B should be gravitationally redshifted. This was confirmed when Adams measured this redshift in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Since photons {{contribute}} to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a gravitational attraction on other objects, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in gravitational lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical electromagnetic waves.|$|E
5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} sets {{of numbers}} such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product {{of all the other}} numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E

5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> black holes may have warranted the prize had he {{lived long enough to}} see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers {{less than or equal}} to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E

5|$|Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in {{vessels that}} {{contained}} a filter to prevent particles from passing {{through to the}} growth medium, and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not {{come in contact with}} the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths {{at the beginning of his}} experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous generation and supported the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> finite differences, {{and was the first}} to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E

5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory {{on the origin of}} species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On the Origin of Species. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On the Origin of Species would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E
