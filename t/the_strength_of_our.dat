25|$|Organizers {{released}} a statement about {{the purpose of the}} demonstration: The Women's March on Washington, Portland is aligned with the mission of the national march, which is a national movement to unify and empower everyone who stands for women's rights, human rights, immigrant rights, civil liberties, and social justice for all. This is a non-partisan, permitted and peaceful event where we march in solidarity with our partners and children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families — recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country. Oregon and Greater Portland NOW and Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette are two of our several sponsors and allies.|$|E
500|$|The Florida recount {{was stopped}} {{a few weeks}} later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be {{completed}} by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, [...] "for the sake of our unity as a people and <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> democracy, I offer my concession." ...|$|E

2500|$|By February 1942 Japanese {{forces had}} gained footholds in territories {{adjoining}} northern Australia {{which made it}} seem probable that the advance southwards would continue, culminating in the invasion of Australia. This threat of invasion in 1942 is summarised in a statement made by Prime Minister Curtin in 1944, {{in which he said}} now that Singapore was lost and we were unable to concentrate a superior fleet, <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> defences was inadequate to defend Australia ... against an enemy with command of the sea and air.

2500|$|Also in 1992, the New York museum building's {{exhibition}} and other space was expanded {{by the addition}} of an adjoining rectangular tower, taller than the original spiral, and a renovation of the original building. [...] The same year, the foundation opened a small Guggenheim Museum SoHo in the SoHo neighborhood of downtown Manhattan. This space was kept after the main museum was re-opened, but it closed in 2002 due to an economic downturn. [...] To finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani to raise $47 million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for [...] "trendy" [...] latecomers. In The New York Times, critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales [...] "stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do." [...] Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its [...] "postwar collection to <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> pre-war holdings" [...] and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.|$|E
2500|$|A fierce {{opponent}} of xenophobia, he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This {{clashed with the}} Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia's [...] "special place" [...] in the world. [...] " [...] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [...] above the West just on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being Orthodox," [...] Tolstoy wrote in a letter. All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia's potential guiding light. [...] "What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity," [...] Tolstoy argued. Being neither a westernizer nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on {{the cult of the}} nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy's critique of the West's amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile Moscovia State being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic [...] "political romanticism" [...] appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time.|$|E

60|$|A still {{stronger}} {{argument against}} ascribing an objective existence to force or power, on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> supposed direct intuition {{of power in}} voluntary acts, may be urged from the unquestionable fact, {{that we do not}} know, and cannot know, that volition does cause corporeal motion; while {{there is a great deal}} to be said in favour of the view that it is no cause, but merely a concomitant of that motion.
