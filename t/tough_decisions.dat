In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E

GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner was also forced to resign. GM bondholders rejected the government's first offer, but the unions agreed to the preferential terms. A bondholder debt to equity counteroffer was ignored.|$|E

25|$|San Jose General Manager Doug Wilson {{announced}} on June 22, 2010 that Nabokov {{would not return}} to the team for the 2010–11 season, a consequence of the NHL's salary cap. The decision received negative reviews from San Jose fans as Nabokov has been a pivotal part of the team's regular season success. He is considered {{to be one of the}} team's two greatest draft picks, along with Patrick Marleau. Nabokov has also taken heat for being at the center of the team's playoff failures and with <b>tough</b> <b>decisions</b> looming in the form of major free agents Marleau and Joe Pavelski, Wilson felt that keeping Nabokov was less of a priority in a cap era.|$|E
25|$|Zhou's {{political}} {{fate was}} subject to rife speculation in the lead-up to the 16th Party Congress held {{in the fall of}} 2002. Widely regarded as a rising political star, Zhou was said to be a leading candidate for Vice-Premier or entry into the top ranks of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (Zhengfawei). The central government was also in need of a tough and uncompromising figure to take reins of China's security system in the post-9/11 global security paradigm. With his quasi-military style training in the oil sector and a reputation for being able to make <b>tough</b> <b>decisions,</b> Zhou got the nod to become Minister of Public Security in December 2002. He also earned a series of powerful posts in the party and government within the span of a few months, including membership in the Politburo, State Councilor, Deputy Zhengfawei Secretary, First Political Commissar of the People's Armed Police (China's paramilitary police force), and Secretary of the party's Central Secretariat (the party's internal policy execution and coordination body).|$|E
25|$|It was in 1943, {{while on}} {{holidays}} in Glengariff, West Cork, that Lynch met his future wife, Máirín O'Connor, {{the daughter of}} a Dublin judge. Lynch was to be her first and only boyfriend, and the couple were married three years later on 10 August 1946. Although she was apprehensive about her husband's decision to become active in politics, to become a Minister and even to become Taoiseach, she stood by him through it all and helped him make the <b>tough</b> <b>decisions</b> that would affect Lynch's life and her own. One story exists where Lynch, in spite of tremendous pressure from Seán Lemass and the entire Fianna Fáil party to stand for the leadership, only accepted the nomination after Máirín had agreed. The fact that the couple didn't have any children allowed Lynch to embark on a political career, without having to worry about his commitment to the family. However, he remained totally devoted to Máirín throughout his, and she became just as easily recognisable as her husband.|$|E

25|$|After several {{visits to}} friends who lived Kamloops, Lake and his wife, {{along with their}} three daughters, decided to move there. He got a {{teaching}} position at Thompson Rivers University's animal-health technology program beginning in 1997. He became active in the community, playing in the soccer league, coaching youth soccer and lobbying to ban performances by exotic animals within the city, like during a circus or rodeo. In 1999, he sought to be elected to the city council. During the campaign, he noted {{that he was in}} favour of installing residential water meters, a moratorium on new big-box stores until an impact assessment was completed, and he was opposed to using referendums to make <b>tough</b> <b>decisions.</b> With eight council seats in contention, Lake finished in ninth place with 5,400 votes and claimed $4,562 in election expenses. Lake complained afterwards, and sought legal advice, regarding illegal advertising by the third-place finisher, Brian Husband, who ran radio ads on election day. Lake continued to help organize the World Small Animal Veterinary Association's annual (2001) conference which he helped attract to Vancouver. He returned to Kamloops advocating that the city develop a modern conference centre.|$|E

She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close. Minister Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was re-elected by just 40 votes. The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated {{in an interview that}} <b>tough</b> <b>decisions</b> were looming in the industry.

[...] Director Cliff Bole felt the episode was [...] "well-accepted", and both he and the producers liked it. [...] Actor Tom Wright explained the episode's popularity saying it resounded with viewers because it had no outright moralizations or specific good and evil characters; the episode deals with a no-win scenario.

[...] Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's The Globe and Mail was also positive: [...] "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the <b>tough</b> <b>decisions</b> of his prime ministership, he does {{a pretty good job}} of persuading otherwise in A Journey."

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea {{considered}} {{movement through}} the city a pleasure, but many fights tedious. Eurogamer's Donlan stated Infamous 2 is [...] "video games' true master of parkour" [...] and found the combat struggled to match the thrills of traversal but that the combat had improved since the original. Game Informers Reiner enjoyed combat, describing the situations as [...] "amazing open-world superhero fights." [...] Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker felt enemies were overwhelming at times during combat like in the original Infamous. Mc Shea found the pacing uneven and the morality system [...] "laughable". Shoemaker felt the powers of Good and Evil Cole were better balanced than {{in the first game}} and saw morality as only a gateway to cutscenes and the possible powers. GameTrailers's reviewer said the morality system did not provide <b>tough</b> <b>decisions,</b> but provided two dramatically different gameplay experiences. Both Mc Shea and Reiner thought UGC was a [...] "great" [...] addition to the game. 1UP reviewer Thierry Nguyen hoped Sucker Punch would mix the combat and traversal of the game with the pacing and storytelling of the first Infamous to create an [...] "utterly fantastic" [...] superhero game.|$|E
500|$|Both the {{physical}} appearance {{and behavior of}} Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect {{the physical}} resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was {{in that they are}} both forced to make <b>tough</b> <b>decisions</b> over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly {{due to the fact that}} he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. [...] "You don't have to plan ... because you get to just be the character," [...] Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was [...] "exciting" [...] and helpful. The team felt that Henry's actions are dedicated to protecting Sam, and that Scott introduced that dedication to the character. Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was [...] "genuinely scared", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters.|$|E
