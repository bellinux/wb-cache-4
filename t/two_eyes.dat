5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with <b>two</b> <b>eyes,</b> eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the <b>two</b> <b>eyes</b> come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when <b>two</b> <b>eyes</b> instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture speckled images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E

25|$|Stereoacuity {{is limited}} by the visual acuity of the eyes, and in {{particular}} by the visual acuity of the weaker eye.

Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} eye {{trackers}} {{is becoming more}} and more popular in the field of information visualization. In this project <b>two</b> <b>eye</b> trackers, The Eye Tribe nd Mirametrix S 2, are used to obtain eye tracking data for visualizations. It is planned to use the eye trackers with OnGraX, a network visualization system, where they will provide data for the implementation of visualizations, specifically, heatmaps. OnGraX already uses heatmaps to show regions in a network that have been in the viewport of the user. One aim of this thesis will be the comparison between the <b>two</b> <b>eye</b> trackers, and if the use of eye tracking data gives better results thatn the already existing viewport-based approach. At the same time, we provide the foundation for adaptive visualizations with OnGraX. Our research problem is also of interest for visualization in general, because it will help to improve and develop eye tracking technology in this context. To support the outcome of our implementation, we carried out a user study. As a result, we concluded that one of the <b>two</b> <b>eye</b> trackers appears to have more capabilities than the other, and that using the eye tracking data is a more preferred way of depicting the heatmaps on OnGraX. ...|$|R
25|$|Spiders of the ecribellate haplogyne family Caponiidae are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They differ from other spiders in lacking book lungs and having the {{posterior}} median spinnerets anteriorly displaced to form a transverse row with the anterior lateral spinnerets. Most species have only <b>two</b> <b>eyes,</b> which is also unusual among spiders. A few species of Caponiidae variously have four, six or eight eyes. In some species the number of eyes will increase when the spiderling changes its skin as it grows towards adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic acuity is {{the ability}} to detect {{differences}} in depth with the <b>two</b> <b>eyes.</b> For more complex targets, stereoacuity is similar to normal monocular visual acuity, or around 0.6–1.0 arc minutes, but for much simpler targets, such as vertical rods, may be as low as only 2 arc seconds. Although stereoacuity normally corresponds very well with monocular acuity, it may be very poor, or absent, even in subjects with normal monocular acuities. Such individuals typically have abnormal visual development when they are very young, such as an alternating strabismus, or eye turn, where both eyes rarely, or never, point in the same direction and therefore do not function together.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, {{objective}} {{factors that}} prevent the illusion from succeeding completely: (1) the canvas is two-dimensional while reality is three-dimensional, (2) {{the uniqueness of}} the view-point (humans have <b>two</b> <b>eyes).</b> Metzinger compensates for the missing spatiality in his two-dimensional representation by giving other cues for depth, in addition to relative size: shading and shadows, source of light, occlusion (e.g., the stage or table upon which the woman dances cuts 'in front' of the woman sitting at the table). Metzinger represents a subjective effect objectively on the canvas, imitating subjective phenomena (of vision) objectively. Henri Poincaré, in Science and Hypothesis, 1902, discusses 'representative' space (visual, tactile and motor space) versus 'geometrical' space.|$|E
