40|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>leveling</b> is {{a process}} used in the steel {{industry}} in order to eliminate any shape imperfections of cold-rolled thin strips. The master thesis deals with developing a computer program that generates basic parameters of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> line. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes the types of the shape imperfections in strips, their causes and the principles of their elimination. This part also presents the mechanism of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> and describes the present-day design of tension levelers. The practical part of the thesis starts with an analytical description of stress-strain behaviour of strip during <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> (supposing the simplified conditions). A computer program that allows devising basic parameters of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> line is created {{on the basis of}} these analytical relations. The program results are successfully verified by numerical model based on the finite element method (FEM) created in the program ANSYS. Then the interdependencies of certain input and output parameters of created program are determined. These interdependencies can be used as effective design of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> lines...|$|E
40|$|In <b>tension</b> <b>leveling,</b> {{elongation}} {{is determined}} {{by a combination of}} tension and deformation curvature, so how to set up optimization of the processing parameters has been emphasized by researchers. In this paper, the deformation work in <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> was introduced. According to the calculation used in a tension leveler, the tension and deformation curvature which results in less deformation work under a certain elongation is presented. The method can determine the leveling processes parameters for different strip with various properties and sizes...|$|E
40|$|The shape defects such as edge {{waves and}} center buckles may be {{formed in the}} rolled strip because rolling can easily produce non-homogenous {{elongation}} across the strip width. The main purpose of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> is to remove such defects by eliminating the differences in elongation. In this paper, a new approach for the optimization of the process conditions in <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> is presented. The approach consists of an analytic model for the prediction of the strip curvature and the force at each roll. The accuracy of the proposed model is examined through comparison with the predictions from a finite element model...|$|E
40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (<b>tension</b> or roller) <b>leveling</b> or by {{skin-pass}} rolling, and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The evolvement of {{plate in}} 15 -roller {{combination}} leveler {{has been studied}} in this paper using both geometrical analysis and FEM. The {{results show that the}} bending deformation and curvature evolvement are different from those obtained by general leveler. The technologies of parallel leveling and <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> are adaptive to the roll system of combination leveler, which not only can improve leveling precision, but also can erase the influence of negative torque on leveling roll, thus improving the leveling strength capacity of leveling materials. Meanwhile, a new calculating method of leveling process was pointed out, whose results were basically consistent to those of experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Combining {{with both}} working {{condition}} of working roll in tension leveler and wear classification, this paper maintains that abrasive wear {{is the main}} type of working roll’s abrasion, and states that shape defects of hot rolled strip is {{the main cause of}} the abnormal abrasion of working roll, and concludes that to reduce the wear of working roll relying solely on technology of <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> has its limits. So, combining with the materials of working roll in tension leveler and rolling mill, the surface hardness and the wear rates of different materials after heat treatment are experimentally analyzed to provide a theoretical guidance for the further improvement of working roll’s materials...|$|E
40|$|Pinholes {{or other}} defect sites in a {{protective}} oxide coating provide pathways for atomic oxygen in low Earth orbit to reach underlying material. One concept for enhancing {{the lifetime of}} materials in low Earth orbits is to apply a leveling coating to the material prior to applying any reflective and protective coatings. Using a surface <b>tension</b> <b>leveling</b> coating concept, a low viscosity epoxy {{was applied to the}} surface of several composite coupons. A protective layer of 1000 A of SiO 2 was deposited on top of the leveling coating, and the coupons were exposed to an atomic oxygen environment in a plasma asher. Pinhole populations per unit area were estimated by counting the number of undercut sites observed by scanning electron microscopy. Defect density values of 180, 000 defects/sq cm were reduced to about 1000 defects/sq cm {{as a result of the}} applied leveling coating. These improvements occur at a mass penalty of about 2. 5 mg/sq cm...|$|E
