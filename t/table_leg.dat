5|$|Later during World War II, with Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his fellow}} conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, establish a new government and save Germany from total destruction. Stauffenberg had his opportunity on 20 July 1944 at a military briefing at Hitler's East Prussian headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze). He managed to get through security and plant a briefcase bomb under the conference table. The bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and a stenographer who died shortly thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the bomb blast by the conference <b>table</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated propsâ€”first a <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E

On 20 July 1944, during a military conference at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb underneath Hitler's conference table and then quickly left, claiming {{he had to make}} an important telephone call.

5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a <b>table</b> <b>leg,</b> which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E

Meanwhile, Block becomes infected along with others, while Cherry and El Wray take refuge at the Bone Shack.|$|E

In his right hand he holds a <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> instead of the original sword and myths abound {{as to how the}} switch was carried out and by whom. In 1704, the University's first astronomical observatory was built on top of the gatehouse. Beneath the founder's statue are the coats of arms of Edward III, the founder of King's Hall, and those of his five sons who survived to maturity, as well as William of Hatfield, whose shield is blank as he died as an infant, before being granted arms.|$|E

500|$|The alien suits {{were made}} more {{flexible}} and durable {{than the ones}} used in Alien to expand on the creatures' movements {{and allow them to}} crawl and jump. Dancers, gymnasts, and stunt men were hired to portray the aliens. Various [...] tall mannequins also were created to make aliens that stood in inhuman poses, and could have their bodies exploded to simulate gunshot wounds. Stan Winston's team created fully articulated facehuggers that could move their fingers; these were moved by wires hidden on the scenery or the actors' clothing. The one that walked towards Ripley had a mechanism akin to a pull toy, with pulleys that moved the fingers, and its jump combined three models shot separately: the walking facehugger, a stationary model dangling on a <b>table</b> <b>leg,</b> and another model being pulled towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "there {{may be more}} {{entertaining}} and less problematic movies, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a <b>table</b> <b>leg.</b> The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a good movie, but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Ernest Thayer's 1888 baseball poem [...] "Casey at the Bat." [...] The episode makes several allusions to the film The Natural. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created [...] "Wonderbat", is akin to Roy Hobbs's [...] "Wonderboy", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film. The end song [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] is a parody of [...] "Talkin' Baseball" [...] by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the {{new version of the}} song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it. The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is {{a reference to}} the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees. Carl batting with a piano leg is a reference to Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers, who once tried to bat with a <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering and threw a no-hitter.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, Reith {{directly}} {{oversaw the}} abdication broadcast of Edward VIII. By then his style had become well-established {{in the public}} eye. He personally introduced the ex-King (as 'Prince Edward'), before standing aside to allow Edward to take the chair. Doing so, Edward accidentally knocked the <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> with his foot, which {{was picked up by}} the microphone. Reith later noted in an interview with Malcolm Muggeridge that some headlines interpreted that as Reith [...] "slamming the door" [...] in disgust before Edward began broadcasting.|$|E

[...] "It was so competitive, they broke a leg from a table and they threw it, it went right through his heart and he died right on the court. So I'm accustomed to playing basketball really rough." [...] The player to whom Artest was referring was 19-year-old Lloyd Newton, who was stabbed in the back with a broken-off <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> during an altercation at a 1991 YMCA-sanctioned basketball tournament.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 1973 Wandrey created two tables, one {{featuring}} axes as <b>table</b> <b>legs,</b> Hatchet-Table (1977), {{and the other}} featuring saws as legs, Saw-Table (1977).

2500|$|In 1973, Ryan set {{his first}} major record when he struck out 383 batters in one season, beating Sandy Koufax's old mark by one. Remarking on this feat, Koufax joked, [...] "Yeah, and he also surpassed my total for bases on balls in a single season by 91. I suspect half of those guys he struck out swung rather than get hit." [...] Ryan threw two no-hitters in 1973. In the second one, on July 15 against the Detroit Tigers, he struck out 17 batters â€“ most in a {{recorded}} no-hitter. (This record would later be tied by Max Scherzer on October 3, 2015.) Ryan was so dominant in this game, it led to one of baseball's best-remembered pranks. Tigers first baseman and cleanup hitter Norm Cash came to the plate with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, having already struck out twice, and was carrying a clubhouse <b>table</b> <b>leg</b> instead of a bat. [...] Plate umpire Ron Luciano ordered Cash to go back and get a regulation bat, to which Cash replied, [...] "Why, I won't hit him anyway!" [...] With a regulation bat in hand, Cash did finally make contact, but popped out to end the game.|$|E

50|$|Florentine Console {{tables were}} often richly {{decorated}} and sumptuous.

Most of their themes were copied or nearly identical to their Roman counterparts, but the Florentines became famous for these designs.|$|R
