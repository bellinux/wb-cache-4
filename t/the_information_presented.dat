5|$|Marcinkus {{was seldom}} {{mentioned}} during the Cold War and his pre-war biography was only reprinted in the Lithuanian émigré press, {{particularly in the}} US During the 1950s articles about Marcinkus {{began to appear in}} these newspapers, including Karys, Vienas iš daugelio (1950), Paskutinis žuvusiojo lakūno atvirukas (1955), and Kapitono Marcinkaus mirtis nelaisvėje (1956). The first significant publication discussing Marcinkus in Soviet Lithuania appeared in a 1967 issue of the journal Švytūrys. Thereinafter Marcinkus's life was more frequently mentioned, although much of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> was inaccurate and incomplete.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E

50|$|Haploid yeast switch mating type by {{replacing}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> at <b>the</b> MAT locus. For example, an a cell will switch to an α cell {{by replacing}} the MATa allele with the MATα allele. This replacement of one allele of MAT {{for the other}} is possible because yeast cells carry an additional silenced copy of both the MATa and MATα alleles: the HML (Hidden MAT Left) locus typically carries a silenced copy of the MATα allele, and the HMR (Hidden MAT Right) locus typically carries a silenced copy of the MATa allele. The silent HML and HMR loci are {{often referred to as}} the silent mating cassettes, as <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> there is read into the active MAT locus.|$|R
50|$|The {{repair of}} the MAT locus after cutting by the HO {{endonuclease}} almost always {{results in a}} mating type switch. When an a cell cuts the MATa allele present at the MAT locus, the cut at MAT will almost always be repaired by copying <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> at HML. This results in MAT being repaired to the MATα allele, switching the mating type of the cell from a to α. Similarly, an α cell which has its MATα allele cut by the HO endonuclease will almost always repair the damage using <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> at HMR, copying the MATa gene to the MAT locus and switching the mating type of α cell to a.|$|R
25|$|On 27 September, Admiral Murray {{arrived at}} Halifax from Bermuda. Although <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> {{to him was}} still confused, the {{apparent}} lack of transports and troops indicated that the expedition was a raid rather than a serious attempt to take Newfoundland.

50|$|Because of <b>the</b> way <b>information</b> is {{encoded in}} {{analogue}} circuits, {{they are much}} more susceptible to noise than digital circuits, since a small change in the signal can represent a significant change in <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> in <b>the</b> signal and can cause <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>present</b> to be lost. Since digital signals take on one of only two different values, a disturbance would have to be about one-half the magnitude of the digital signal to cause an error. This property of digital circuits can be exploited to make signal processing noise-resistant. In digital electronics, because <b>the</b> <b>information</b> is quantized, as long as the signal stays inside a range of values, it represents <b>the</b> same <b>information.</b> Digital circuits use this principle to regenerate the signal at each logic gate, lessening or removing noise.|$|R

On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> to him.|$|E
25|$|Gazetteers {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented.</b> World gazetteers usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form gazetteers, {{often used in}} conjunction with computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|E
500|$|The creators' and producers' {{goals were}} to [...] "empower, challenge, {{and build the}} {{self-esteem}} of preschoolers" [...] while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research. [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and take it one step further," [...] Santomero said. [...] Like Sesame Street, formative research which the producers called their [...] "secret sauce," [...] was used during {{all aspects of the}} creative and decision-making process during the production of Blue's Clues. In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by Variety its [...] "call and response style," [...] that encouraged mastery of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented,</b> positive reinforcement, and prosocial messages. In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra. The research team and creators worked collaboratively.|$|E

2500|$|Rough {{set theory}} {{is one of}} many methods that can be {{employed}} to analyse uncertain (including vague) systems, although less common than more traditional methods of probability, statistics, entropy and Dempster–Shafer theory. However a key difference, and a unique strength, of using classical rough set theory is that it provides an objective form of analysis (Pawlak et al. 1995). Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical rough set analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995). [...] More recent adaptations of rough set theory, such as dominance-based, decision-theoretic and fuzzy rough sets, have introduced more subjectivity to the analysis.|$|E

[...] Evidence presented in court proceedings is subject to extreme scrutiny, so {{it is very important that}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>presented</b> to the judge and jury has been obtained using the Scientific Method.
