5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> for dry laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} phases in Virginia's Reconstruction era: wartime, presidential, and congressional. Immediately {{after the war}} President Andrew Johnson {{recognized}} the Francis Harrison Pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government. The Virginia legislature passed Black Codes that severely restricted Freedmen's mobility and rights; they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens, nor could <b>they</b> <b>vote.</b> The state ratified the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the 1861 ordnance of secession. Johnson was satisfied that Reconstruction was complete.|$|E

Puerto Rico, unlike several other U.S. territories such as Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, {{is not on the}} United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. As it is not a state, its citizens do {{not have the right to}} full representation in the U.S. Congress nor can <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> in presidential elections.

25|$|In the November 1860 Presidential election, Kentucky voters gave native Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln {{less than}} one percent of the vote.

25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion that {{democracy is}} government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
25|$|The series also sidesteps {{issues of}} {{stereotyping}} by having characters {{in both the}} Muslim and non-Muslim communities who cross the entire spectrum of political opinion. Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't care what anybody's religious beliefs are as long as <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> for her on election day.|$|E
25|$|From 1970 to 2009, the House {{expanded}} delegates, {{along with}} their powers and privileges representing U.S. citizens in non-state areas, beginning with representation on committees for Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner in 1970. In 1971, a delegate for the District of Columbia was authorized, and in 1972 new delegate positions were established for U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. 1978 saw an additional delegate for American Samoa, and another for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands began in 2009.

25|$|In England, senior Church {{appointments}} are Crown appointments; the Church {{carries out}} state {{functions such as}} coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual {{as opposed to the}} lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when <b>they</b> <b>vote</b> as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and euthanasia (where their views differ from the majority of the population). A of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.|$|E
