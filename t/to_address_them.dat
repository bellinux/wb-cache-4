5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The {{ranks of the}} companions were greatly increased {{during the reign of}} Philip II when he expanded this institution to include Upper Macedonian aristocrats as well as Greeks. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence also suggests that an assembly of the army during times of war and a people's assembly during times of peace existed in ancient Macedonia. The first recorded instance dates to 359 BC, when Philip II called together a number of assemblies <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them</b> with speech and raise their morale following the death of Perdiccas III of Macedon in battle against the Illyrians.|$|E

25|$|In this {{interview}} he also expressed {{his belief that}} currently, the global market is the largest force shaping {{the lives of people}} throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that {{the most effective way to}} solve social problems in individual countries is <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them</b> at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to bring about change would be to make a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's own clothes.|$|E

A report by UCL’s Academic Committee Review Panel noted that, according to the Institute’s own review findings, senior members of UCL staff had been aware of issues affecting students' results but had not taken action <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them.</b> The Review Panel concluded that there had been an apparent lack of ownership of these matters amongst the Institute’s senior staff.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} several years, many {{enterprises}} have created data warehouses (and data marts) in order to run applications. Data warehousing technologies used have been primarily extract-transform-load (ETL) tools, database modeling and design tools, and relational database (RDB) systems. There are three major holes in data warehousing today. These include inadequate attention to dirty data, inadequate performance and scalability in supporting scan-oriented operations, and inadequate selection of source data to load into the data warehouse. In this article, these three problematic areas are explored and approaches <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>them</b> are outlined. ...|$|R

While never blindly loyal to any organization, Gordimer saw the ANC as the best hope for reversing South Africa's treatment of black citizens. Rather than simply criticizing the organization for its perceived flaws, she advocated joining it <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them.</b> She hid ANC leaders in her own home to aid their escape from arrest by the government, and she said that the proudest day of her life was when she testified at the 1986 Delmas Treason Trial on behalf of 22 South African anti-apartheid activists. (See Simon Nkoli, Mosiuoa Lekota, etc.) Throughout these years she also regularly took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa, and traveled internationally speaking out against South African apartheid and discrimination and political repression.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, the long-contemplated {{building}} of the north-south Delaware Railroad finally got underway. In the works since the company was chartered in 1836, funds were finally raised and a route laid out. Constitutional reform was also seriously considered at this time. By 1850, New Castle County had nearly half {{the population of the}} state, but only one third of the representation in the Delaware General Assembly. This and other populist measures led the Democrats to call for a Constitutional Convention <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them.</b> Using methods that were probably unconstitutional, the Democrats managed to get the Convention convened in December 1852, but the majority of the delegates were Whigs. After several months of negotiation, compromises were reached that satisfied no one and the whole effort was resoundingly rejected at the polls. The Constitution of 1831 would remain in effect.|$|E
25|$|International catastrophes such as {{the wreck}} of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal {{disaster}} in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them</b> needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity {{such as the}} Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.|$|E

25|$|Membership in Fair Labour Association: In 2011, Nestlé {{started to}} work with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a non-profit, multi-stakeholder {{association}} that works with major companies to improve working conditions in developing countries, to assess labor conditions and compliance risks throughout Nestlé’s supply chain of hazelnuts and cocoa. On 29 February 2012, Nestlé became the first company in the food industry to join the FLA. Building on Nestlé's efforts under the Cocoa Plan, the FLA will send independent experts to Ivory Coast in 2012 and where evidence of child labour is found, the FLA will identify root causes and advise Nestlé how <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them</b> in sustainable and lasting ways.

25|$|The {{government}} of Uzbekistan has acknowledged {{the extent of}} the country's environmental problems, and it has made a commitment <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>them</b> in its Biodiversity Action Plan. But the governmental structures to deal with these problems remain confused and ill-defined. Old agencies and organizations have been expanded to address these questions, and new ones have been created, resulting in a bureaucratic web of agencies with no generally understood commitment to attack environmental problems directly. Various nongovernmental and grassroots environmental organizations also have begun to form, some closely tied to the current government and others assuming an opposition stance. For example, environmental issues were prominent points in the original platform of Birlik, the first major opposition movement to emerge in Uzbekistan. By the mid-1990s, such issues had become a key concern of all opposition groups and a cause of growing concern among the population as a whole.|$|E
