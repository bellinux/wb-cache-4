25|$|Aristotle {{taught that}} {{to achieve a}} virtuous and {{potentially}} happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses {{to do the best}} things. When <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> {{in the world}} {{not only because of}} their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). He adds that Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E

They held two meetings, one in March 1888 and a second more {{significant}} meeting at Gladstone's home in Hawarden on 18–19 December 1889. On each occasion, Parnell's demands were entirely within the accepted parameters of Liberal thinking, Gladstone noting {{that he was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> he had known to deal with, a remarkable transition from an inmate at Kilmainham to an intimate at Hawarden in just over seven years. This was the high point of Parnell's career. In the early part of 1890, he still hoped to advance the situation on the land question, with which a substantial section of his party was displeased.|$|E

25|$|Katie Starks {{was born}} September 25, 1909 in Redwater, Texas. Katie was 36 {{at the time}} of the attack. She was married to Virgil Starks and lived at their {{farmhouse}} of five years on 500 acres of farmland off Highway 67 East almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana. Her sister, Mrs. Allen, lived directly across the street from her. She was the daughter of Jim Strickland. She and Virgil went to school together growing up because their parents lived on neighboring farms in Red Springs, Texas. A friend had stated that she and Virgil were two of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> he had ever known. After discovering her husband dead, she ran to telephone police. She rung the phone twice when she was shot two times in the face. One bullet went through the right cheek beside the nose, emerging behind the left ear, and the other went in her lower jaw below the lip, breaking her jaw and splintering several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She ran to a neighbor's house who then took her to the hospital where she recovered.|$|E

Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, [...] "We selected <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts.

[...] Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a [...] "mind's eye" [...] view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences.

500|$|Whenever {{there is}} talk about new {{policies}} regarding new work time policies, there is often the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> in the field.|$|E

Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees; Cooke states that his [...] "standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme". There can be no doubt about some of his qualities. [...] He was exceptionally hardworking, and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic. [...] He was a good judge of men, which enabled him to select <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> to be his agents. He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies, supporting them financially at their times of need. He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. [...] He paid his men fairly and generously.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, {{she thought of the}} song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. She had always been a fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>people</b> out there...we kind of did what we both do and having O.D.B took it to another level. He was my ultimate choice, so I was really happy with the way it turned out." [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] was a song that Carey wrote with the R group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E
