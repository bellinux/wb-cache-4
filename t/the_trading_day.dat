5|$|Ireland became {{home to one}} of Microsoft's {{international}} {{production facilities}} in 1985, and on November 20 Microsoft released its first retail version of Microsoft Windows (Windows 1.0), originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system. In August, Microsoft and IBM partnered {{in the development of a}} different operating system called OS/2. OS/2 was marketed in connection with a new hardware design proprietary to IBM, the PS/2. On February 16, 1986, Microsoft relocated their headquarters to a corporate office campus in Redmond, Washington. Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to OEMs. By then the company was the world's largest producer of software for personal computers—ahead of former leader Lotus Development—and published the three most-popular Macintosh business applications. That year the company purchased Forethought, the developer of PowerPoint and Microsoft's first major software acquisition.|$|E

40|$|We develop several {{hypotheses}} regarding short-selling activity around Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

We find {{a substantial increase in}} short-selling activity in <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> prior to <b>the</b> landfall of Rita and relatively less short-selling activity in <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> after landfall. There is little evidence that suggests that traders short insurance stocks with more potential exposure in the Gulf region than other insurance stocks in the days before landfall.

25|$|The {{ability to}} {{purchase}} and redeem creation units gives ETFs an arbitrage mechanism intended {{to minimize the}} potential deviation between the market price and the net asset value of ETF shares. Existing ETFs have transparent portfolios, so institutional investors will know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble {{if they wish to}} purchase a creation unit, and the exchange disseminates the updated net asset value of the shares throughout <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> typically at 15-second intervals.|$|E
25|$|ORB {{offers an}} open and {{transparent}} market model for trading in retail-size.

This creates a greater efficiency of electronic on-book execution and option to use straight-through-processing to settlement system.|$|E
25|$|In early November 2012, Groupon {{reported}} they had missed their third quarter revenue estimates, posting a revenue of $586.6 million while estimates were at $591 million. This caused Groupon's stocks {{to fall to}} as low as $2.93/share early in <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day.</b> Groupon has said to have lost 80% of its value since its initial public offering over one year ago. The stock has since rebounded and was trading around $8 in Q1 2015 before plunging as low as $2.15 in early 2016.|$|E

Since both the equity and equity options markets have multiple exchanges, quotation and last trades data from all must be consolidated in real time to provide a market view, rather than an individual exchange view.|$|E
25|$|An ETF {{combines}} the valuation feature of {{a mutual fund}} or unit investment trust, which can be bought or sold {{at the end of}} each trading day for its net asset value, with the tradability feature of a closed-end fund, which trades throughout <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day</b> at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value. Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been index funds, but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E
25|$|When Microsoft {{went public}} and {{launched}} its {{initial public offering}} (IPO) in 1986, the opening stock price was $21; after <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> the price closed at $27.75. As of July 2010, with the company's nine stock splits, any IPO shares would be multiplied by 288; {{if one were to}} buy the IPO today given the splits and other factors, it would cost about 9cents. The stock price peaked in 1999 at around $119 ($60.928 adjusting for splits). The company began to offer a dividend on January 16, 2003, starting at eight cents per share for the fiscal year followed by a dividend of sixteen cents per share the subsequent year, switching from yearly to quarterly dividends in 2005 with eight cents a share per quarter and a special one-time payout of three dollars per share for the second quarter of the fiscal year. Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years.|$|E

25|$|The NYSE's {{opening and}} closing bells mark the {{beginning}} and the end of each trading day. The 'opening bell' is rung at 9:30am ET to mark the start of the day's trading session. At 4pm ET the 'closing bell' is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed. There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a single-stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence. A third, red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring.|$|E
