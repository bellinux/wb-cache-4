5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress.</b> The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest {{should not be allowed}} to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after the charges against him were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake on the part of the Company's chief Factors.|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress</b> for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of New Amsterdam, unlike most other colonies in the New World, were thoroughly documented in city maps. During {{the time of}} New Netherland's colonization, the Dutch were the pre-eminent cartographers in Europe. The delegated authority of the Dutch West India Company over New Netherland required maintaining sovereignty {{on behalf of the}} States General, generating cash flow through commercial enterprise for its shareholders, and funding the province's growth. Thus its directors regularly required that censuses be taken. These tools to measure and monitor the province's progress were accompanied by accurate maps and plans. These surveys, as well as grassroots activities <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress</b> of grievances, account for the existence {{of some of the most}} important of the early documents.|$|E

500|$|Herzig-Yoshinaga and her husband, John [...] "Jack" [...] Herzig, {{pored over}} {{mountains}} of {{documents from the}} War Relocation Authority, a task that [...] "was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a card catalog that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors." [...] Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the United States Supreme Court in the 1944 cases Korematsu v. United States, Hirabayashi v. United States, and Yasui v. United States which challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} relocation and incarceration. The government had presented falsified evidence to the Court, destroyed evidence, and had withheld other vital information. [...] This evidence provided the legal basis Japanese Americans needed <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress</b> and reparations for their wartime imprisonment. The Herzigs' research was also valuable in their work with the National Coalition for Japanese American Redress (NCJAR), which filed a class-action lawsuit against the US Government on behalf of the incarcerees.

2500|$|The Associated Press {{explained}} {{the outpouring of}} sympathy for Qian by observing that many citizens could relate to his tale of victimization {{at the hands of}} authorities, and to his frustration at the lack of channels <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress.</b> The Associated Press observed that [...] "Qian's grievances resonate widely in China, where land disputes have mushroomed amid a fast-paced economic boom.

Even though the delegates had been U.S. allies during the Black Hawk War, they were pressured to sign a removal treaty ceding all Ho-Chunk land west of the Mississippi River to the United States. Decorah signed this treaty as [...] "Wa-kaun-ha-kah (Snake Skin)". The delegates thought that the treaty gave the Ho-Chunks eight years to leave Wisconsin, which would leave them time to negotiate a new treaty, but the wording on the document gave the tribe eight months to vacate Wisconsin and resettle on reservations in Iowa and Minnesota. Ho-Chunks who refused to leave were rounded up by General Henry Atkinson and escorted west, though many later returned.|$|E

In 1923, Chief Flying Hawk, with the support of McCreight, called upon the Council to file the case of United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians. In a later visit to The Wigwam, McCreight asked Flying Hawk about the status of the case.

[...] It was the first mass demonstration at the Zhongnanhai compound in PRC history, and the largest protest in Beijing since 1989. Several Falun Gong representatives met with then-premier Zhu Rongji, who assured them that the government was not against Falun Gong, and promised that the Tianjin practitioners would be released.

2500|$|Rather than {{interpret}} the First Amendment {{to require the}} exemption that Smith and Black sought, the Court encouraged them <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress</b> from the legislature. It observed that Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico already specifically exempted religious uses from their otherwise generally applicable peyote bans. [...] "Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to the press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster the dissemination of the printed word, so also a society that believes in the negative protection afforded to religious belief {{can be expected to}} be solicitous of that value in its legislation as well." [...] Requiring claims for religious exemptions to be vetted through the legislative process might put less popular religions at a disadvantage, but the Court held that this situation was preferable to the relative anarchy that would result from [...] "a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Service members {{discharged}} under DADT continued <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>redress</b> {{through the}} courts without success. Courts often cited the Supreme Court's 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld the constitutionality of state sodomy laws. After the Supreme Court reversed Bowers in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that the Lawrence v. Texas decision applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which banned all acts of sodomy. In both United States v. Stirewalt and United States v. Marcum, the court found Article 125 constitutional, but ruled that the [...] "conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court," [...] but also said that despite the application of Lawrence to the military, Article 125 could still be upheld in cases where there are [...] "factors unique to the military environment" [...] that would place the conduct [...] "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in Lawrence", such as fraternization, public sexual behavior, or anything that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the Lawrence in United States v. Meno and United States v. Bullock. In the course of reviewing the end of DADT, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group recommended repealing or amending Article 125 to eliminate any ban on consensual sodomy between adults.|$|E
