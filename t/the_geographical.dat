5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with <b>the</b> <b>geographical</b> and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of <b>the</b> <b>geographical</b> and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>geographical</b> name changes {{occurred}} in the eastern provinces {{of the country and}} on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live.

5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to <b>the</b> <b>geographical</b> distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote <b>The</b> <b>Geographical</b> Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing <b>the</b> <b>geographical</b> distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E
