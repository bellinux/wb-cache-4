A total of 180 quail chicks were used in the study; comprises 90 males and 90 female birds. The quail were kept on separate floor system and were feed ad libitum. Data were obtained on live weight, body weight, Drumstick weight, <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> shank weight, breast weight, back weight and as well as inedible giblets such as heart weight, gizzard weight, liver weight and offal weight on both sexes of the birds. It was determined that there were significant (P < 0. 05) difference between the carcass component and the sex of the birds. The female quail had higher significant values for live weight (139. 43 g), body weight (133. 93 g), <b>thigh</b> <b>weight</b> (11. 40 g) and shank weight (2. 68 g) than its counterparts male quail of 128. 5 g, 122. 13 g 10. 55 g and 2. 60 g for live weight, body weight, <b>thigh</b> <b>weight</b> and shank weight respectively. Meanwhile, the visceral organs were also significantly (P< 0. 05) differed among the sexes of the used quails. Higher values were obtained for female quails in respect of heart weight (1. 33 g), Gizzard weight (4. 68 g) liver weigh (5. 15 g) and offal weight (12. 18) than the male quails. Consequently, it was concluded that quail breeding for carcass components both edible and visceral organs were favored for female Japanese quail and meat production female quails were better than the male quails...|$|E

The {{experiment was}} carried out in a completely randomized design with 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, including two levels of BBSP, two levels of SO and two methods of amino acids balance (TAA or DAA) in diets. The results showed that main effects of BBSP, SO and feed formulation procedures (TAA or DAA) had no effects on all growth performance parameters (P > 0. 05). Carcass traits, except for <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> were not influenced by all dietary treatments (P > 0. 05). The birds fed diets with BBSP had a greater <b>thigh</b> <b>weight</b> than the other group.

50|$|<b>Thigh</b> <b>weights</b> are {{the most}} {{reasonable}} form of resistance. The location of the mass more readily duplicates the natural fat-storage mechanism {{of the human body}} and being closer to the core. In leg raise exercises, it allows more activation of the hip flexors (and abdominals) without putting more strain on the quadriceps muscles for extension, making it good for sports-specific training on movements like knees and jumping. The greater area and safe location allow it to handle much more weight. For those with wide thighs, such as bodybuilders with large quadriceps, or people with large amounts of fat stores on the inner thigh, it may cause chafing. If worn on both legs, however, the chafing would be between the weights and only damage them, possibly only chafing with a lack of tightness.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of genetic and non-genetic factors on body weight and carcass traits of Japanese quails. Two strains of Japanese quail (150 wild quails and 150 white quails) were used as base population. Four mating groups were used to produce progenies: wild male × wild female, white male × wild female, wild male × white female and white male × white female. Quails were weighed then slaughtered at 35 days of age. The carcass traits consisting carcass weight, breast meat weight, thigh meat weight, skin weight, and abdominal fat weight were recorded after slaughter and after removing feathers, internal organs, and digestive system. Based on these weights, the percentages of carcass, breast, thigh, skin, and abdominal fat were estimated. The effects of sex, hatch, and mating group on body and carcass composition traits were investigated. Sex had a significant effect on all traits (P < 0. 01), {{with the exception of the}} thigh percentage. Moreover, female birds showed higher values for all traits. There were significant differences between hatches and mating groups and wild male × wild female offspring showed highest values of carcass weight, breast weight, <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> skin weight and abdominal fat weight (P < 0. 01). The heritability estimates for body and carcass related traits were moderate to high (0. 22 to 0. 66). The carcass percentage traits showed lower heritability, ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 33. Genetic correlations between body weight and carcass weight, skin weight, breast weight, <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> and abdominal fat weight were moderate to high (0. 37 to 0. 94).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} beak trimming, stocking density (D) and sex (S) on live weight (LW), carcass yield and its component, and plasma glucose (PG) and triglyceride levels in Large White turkeys. To accomplish this aims, totally 288 d old large white turkey chicks (144 in each sex) were used. Beaks of 77 male and female poults were trimmed when 8 d old with an electrical beak trimmer. The birds were fed by commercial turkey rasion. Experiment was designed as 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 3 replications in each group. Beak trimming and stocking density did not affect live weight, carcass composition and its components. The higher LW and carcass weight observed in trimmed groups. As expected, male birds are heavier than female, and carcass percentage (CP) would be adverse. However, in this study, CP of male was higher in trimmed, in 0. 25 m 2 /bird. (D) × sex (S) interaction had an effect on both CP and <b>thigh</b> <b>weights</b> (p< 0. 05). Significantly D×S was observed in LW, CP and PG. The weight of carcass and its some components were higher in male. S×D interaction had an effect on plasma glucose level (p< 0. 05). Triglyceride level was affected (p< 0. 05) by sex. Significant relationships were found between percentage of thighs (r= 0. 447, p< 0. 01) and percentage of breast (r= 0. 400, p< 0. 01). According to this study, it can be said that trimming is useful with density of 0. 25 m 2 /bird in turkey fattening...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of weaner bucks fed raw and processed pigeon pea based diets were evaluated in a 60 -day trial. Twenty four 6 -week-old rabbits averaging 550 g in weight were randomly {{divided into four}} groups of 6 animals each and assigned 4 pigeon pea based diets in a completely randomized design. The diets generally contained maize, wheat offal, soya meal, blood meal, oyster shell, common salt as well as 20 % raw, boiled, toasted and soaked pigeon Pea Seed Meal (PSM), respectively. The Crude Protein (CP %) and metabolizabble energy (Kcal DE kg 1 DM? 103) contents of the diets were 13. 2, 2. 63; 18. 3, 2. 67; 14. 3, 2. 71 and 16. 4, 2. 61, respectively. The parameters measured were Average Daily Feed Intake (ADFI), Average Daily Gain (ADG), Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) as well as carcass characteristics. Results showed that ADFI (g), ADG (g) and FCR differed significantly (p< 0. 05) among treatment groups. The values were 64. 4, 10. 1, 7. 15; 78. 5, 13. 2, 5. 97; 85. 0, 12. 4, 6. 85 and 81. 8, 11. 7, 6. 98 for rabbits fed raw, boiled, toasted and soaked PSM based diets, respectively. Rabbits fed diet containing boiled PSM had significantly (p< 0. 05) lower FCR and higher ADG than those of other treatment groups. The animals subsisting on boiled PSM diet also had significantly higher (p< 0. 05) dressed percentage as well as superior (p< 0. 05) shoulder, loin and <b>thigh</b> <b>weights</b> relative to their counterparts in other treatment groups.

40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} 300 day-old Hubbard Classic broiler chicks with initial body weight (BW) of 43. 6 ± 1. 33 (mean±SD) were {{randomly}} and equally distributed into 15 pens, representing five feeding treatments with three replication per treatment {{to evaluate the}} performance of chicks fed varying dietary levels of cassava root chips (CRC) replacing corn grain (CG). Treatments were replacement of CG with CRC at 0 (T 1), 25 (T 2), 50 (T 3), 75 (T 4) and 100 % (T 5) levels. Isocaloric and isonitrogenous starter and finisher rations were used. Four birds 2 from each sex were randomly taken from each replication and slaughtered for carcass evaluation {{at the end of}} the study. The metabolizable energy content of CRC and CG were 3852 and 3753 kcal/kg dry matter (DM), respectively. Daily DM intake during the entire experimental period ranged 61 to 67 g/bird and was greater (P 0. 05) among treatments. Replacement of CRC for CG at higher levels (75 and 100 %) lowered (P< 0. 05) yield of most carcass parameters such as slaughter weight, dressed weight, eviscerated weight, breast weight, <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> drumstick weight and giblet weight. The same carcass parameters were greater (P< 0. 05) for male than female birds but abdominal fat percentage was higher for females. In conclusion, based on DM intake and growth performance of broilers obtained in this study, CRC could completely replace corn grain in broiler diets as energy feed ingredient. However, looking on the results of yields of major carcass parameters, CRC should substitute corn grain not more than 50 %...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aim of Italian pig {{selection is}} to obtain animals having high aptitude for protected {{designation of origin}} (PDO) dry-cured ham production. The efforts of the last years were directed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identification for large-scale association studies. In this work, SNPs in seven candidate genes for meat quality traits (inositol polyphosphate- 1 -phosphatase, INPP 1, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinases, PIK 3 R 2, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D, PTPRD, phospholipase C gamma 1, PLCG 1, CASP 2 and RIPK 1 domain containing adaptor with death domain, CRADD, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 C, CDKN 1 C, calpain, small subunit 1, CAPNS 1) were found analyzing 22 animals representing the extreme tails of the distribution for phenotypes related to meat quality of 231 Large White×Landrace individuals. Association analysis revealed that the CRADD c. 343 A>G SNP was significant associated with muscle compactness, and the PTPRD c. 2449 C>A polymorphism and the PIK 3 R 2 c. 2966 C>T SNP with muscle compactness and backfat thickness. The five SNPs were then analyzed in 560 Italian Large White with extreme EBVs for fat thickness and in 600 individuals belonging to three Italian breeds (Large White, Duroc, Landrace), with extreme estimated breeding values (EBVs) for fat or growth traits. The PIK 3 R 2 c. 2966 C>T mutation showed significant associations with backfat thickness, average daily gain, feed conversion rate and lean cut yield.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of broilers strain and carcass size on broiler cut's characteristics under Sudan conditions. Two broiler strains (Ross 308) and (Hubbard), and three carcass weights (SMALL (800 g), MEDIUM (1000 g) and LARGE (1300 g)) formed the material of this study. Each carcass was cut into different commercial cuts (including skin and bone) which were breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings and back. The different commercial cuts were first weighed and expressed as a percentage of cold carcass weight. The breast, thighs and drumsticks were further deboned into meat and bone, and then the bones of three commercial cuts were weighted and expressed as a percentage of cut's weight. The results revealed that average <b>thigh</b> <b>weight</b> and percentage; average wing weight and percentage; and average carcass weight loss percentage were not significantly (P≥ 0. 05) affected by strain. The results concerning the effect of strain on cut's bone characteristics indicated that both average thigh bone weight and percentage; average breast bone weight and percentage and average drumsticks bone percentage were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) higher for Hubbard versus Ross. Average weights of thigh, breast, drumsticks, back and wings were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) increased with the increase of carcass weight. The results showed that, with the exception of average thigh bone weight and average drumstick bone percentage, bone weight and percentage was significantly (P≤ 0. 05) different in all other commercial cuts studied. There were no interaction between the strain and carcass size on broilers cut's characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effects of different plantain ash sources (plantain root base ash (PRA) and plantain stalk ash (PSA) supplementation on the performance of pullets fed commercial diets. Ninety six Isa brown pullets aged 15 weeks were therefore used to assess the effect of supplementing commercial diets with plantain root base (PRA) and stalk ashes (PSA) on growth performance, carcass and organ characteristics of pullets during 4 weeks before point of laying (19 weeks of age) and 6 weeks of laying period (25 weeks of age). The pullets were divided into two groups of 48 each for supplementation with either PSA or PRA. Each group was divided into four groups of 12, which were further replicated 3 times with 4 birds per replicate in a completely randomized design. At each developmental stage, the feed offered to the birds was supplemented with 0 (control), 1, 2, and 3 g/kg body weight of PSA or PRA. One g/kgBW of PRA supplementation elicited observable growth performance effects on the birds, while for PSA it was 2 g/kgBW. The 2 g/kgBW PSA supplemented birds gained significantly (P< 0. 05) more weight than the other groups except the control, which consumed significantly (P< 0. 05) more feed. At point of laying, the 1 g/kgBW PRA group recorded significantly (P< 0. 05) higher body weight and weight gain than the control. Plantain root base ash affected dressing percentage significantly (P< 0. 05) resulting in higher <b>thigh</b> <b>weights,</b> while organ weights decreased with increasing ash supplementation levels. Plantain ash therefore has positive effect on growth and edible carcass cut...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal {{muscle mass}} and {{function}} were assessed in 24 adults (16 males, 8 females) with severe, longstanding GH deficiency. Compared to 41 untrained controls (26 males, 15 females), adults with GH deficiency had reduced cross-sectional area of <b>thigh</b> muscle/body <b>weight</b> (p = 0. 01), reduced quadriceps force/weight (males: P = 0. 002; females: P < 0. 0001), and reduced quadriceps force/muscle area (males: P = 0. 005). This suggests (a) that adults with GH deficiency have reduced skeletal muscle mass due, in part, {{to the absence}} of the anabolic effects of GH, and (b) that skeletal muscle force may be reduced due to altered muscle mass, contractile elements/muscle fibre, anaerobic energy supply, neural recruitment of fibres, or a combination of these...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of various pectin to cellules ratios on carcass characteristics and visceral organs of broiler chickens. A total of 400 chickens were allocated to 4 treatments, 4 replications and 25 chickens in each at a completely randomize design. Treatments were consisted of control (treatment 1) or diets containing different pectin: cellulose ratios; 2 : 1 (treatment 2), 1. 5 : 1. 5 (treatment 3) and 1 : 2 (treatment 4), respectively. Carcass weights was significantly decreases at 21 days of age and increases at 42 days of age by treatment 2 (P< 0. 05). The lowest breast weights was obtained by treatment 4 at 21 days of age (P< 0. 05). The lowest and highest <b>thighs</b> <b>weights</b> were related to treatment 3 and 4 at 42 days of age, respectively (P< 0. 05). All treatments convinced a significant decreases in backside and neck weights rather than control at 21 and 42 days of age (P< 0. 05). A significantly decreases in wing weights were observed by treatments 3 and 4 rather than control and treatment 2 at 42 days of age (P< 0. 05).
