5|$|On July 7, 1941, Hansell went to London, England, as {{a special}} {{observer}} attached to the military attaché, where he was privy to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> RAF intelligence and their target folders on the German industrial infrastructure. In his memoir, Hansell stated that in the exchange of information, the AAF received nearly a ton of material, shipped back to the United States in a bomber.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent several}} months of his {{imprisonment}} dictating {{a detailed account of}} his travels to a fellow inmate, Rustichello da Pisa, who incorporated tales of his own as well as other collected anecdotes and current affairs from China. The book soon spread throughout Europe in manuscript form, and became known as The Travels of Marco Polo. It depicts the Polos' journeys throughout Asia, giving Europeans their first comprehensive look into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> the Far East, including China, India, and Japan.|$|E

5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access to Hitler, this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> the Third Reich.|$|E

5|$|The biggest off-the-field {{incident}} was revealed {{on the final}} weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back Ron McKelvey was revealed to be using an assumed name. In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named Ron Weaver who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used the assumed name in order to gather information for a book about <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> Texas football. Weaver later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing Social Security numbers, but he avoided jail and paid no fine. Texas was not sanctioned by the NCAA, but Longhorns players later said the event was a severe distraction from pre-game preparations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} {{years of his}} {{presidency}} at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order {{to spend more time}} programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> the company.|$|E
5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
50|$|Baughman was {{the first}} Secret Service Chief to pen a memoir {{concerning}} the office he held.

The medical drama was a critical and ratings hit in South Korea, gaining praise for its acting (particularly by Kim), writing, direction, and its intelligent and uncompromising story without concessions to melodrama or romance.|$|R
40|$|The {{simulation}} of facial movements {{is a difficult}} task because the complex and sophisticated structure of the human head involves the motion, deformation, and contact handling between bio-tissues that are viscoelastic, nonlinear, anisotropic, and structurally heterogeneous. This {{makes it hard to}} formulate a mathematical model able to represent <b>the</b> biomechanical <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face. Nonetheless, high accuracy and precision are required because, as humans, we are used to observe and decode facial expressions from the moment we are born, and we are expert at easily detecting the smallest artifacts in a virtual facial animation...|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} idea is {{to highlight}} similarities between Islam and other Abrahamic faiths and to celebrate the cultural richness and diversity brought into the American mix by Muslim communities. The film aims to become a dialogue between Americans who might not otherwise interact. It is also a much needed platform for moderate Muslims to express their views about what’s happening in the world. By being both American and Muslim they have a unique insight into <b>the</b> complex <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> American foreign policy {{and the role of}} the media.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> precise <b>inner</b> <b>workings</b> <b>of</b> {{cellular}} mechanisms {{remain largely}} unknown and, therefore, their modeling is usually based on conjectures. The availability of {{large amounts of}} genetic data, {{and the lack of}} abstract mathematical models, makes computer algorithms the only tool available for searching for these hypothetical realities. We call the conjectured algorithmic-independent reality that underlies the method design and intention, the semantics of the algorithm. This article is a brief semantics analysis exercise performed with four binary quantization algorithms for time series of gene expression data. Keywords- binary quantization; gene expression; quantitative semantics I...|$|R

25|$|A {{proof of}} concept virus has used the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to avoid {{detection}} from anti-virus software.

25|$|Detecting {{rootkits}} is a {{major challenge}} for anti-virus programs.
