For the specimens loaded on their <b>tangential</b> <b>sections,</b> the radial shrinkages were even higher than the tangential shrinkages; thus, the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio was decreased by 0.27.

30|$|With {{the lateral}} load applied on the column (Fig.  2 a) gradually, the {{distance}} between the top and bottom surfaces of the mortise in the column is getting increasingly close with the top and bottom surfaces of the tenon. The forces that hinder the relative displacement of the mortise and tenon are gradually arising. When the mentioned surfaces are in contact, they start to transfer the occurred normal stress and tangential stress between the mortise and tenon. The interaction conditions of the joint during the pulling-out of the tenon from the mortise are complicated and parts of the contact surface pairs (CSP) can be clearly seen from Fig.  2 b. The Ι type CSP (CSP-Ι) is the most direct contact surface, which represents the friction area between the transverse section of the mortise and the <b>tangential</b> <b>section</b> of the tenon. CSP-ΙΙ, another contact surface existing in the joint area, represents the friction area between the transverse section of the beam and the <b>tangential</b> <b>section</b> of the column. CSP-ΙΙΙ represents the lateral friction surface pair between the mortise and tenon, the friction between the <b>tangential</b> <b>section</b> of the mortise and the <b>tangential</b> <b>section</b> of the tenon, which cannot be directly seen from Fig.  2 b. Overall, the friction mechanism of the mortise and tenon can fully be reflected by the friction behavior between transverse and tangential sections as well as the transverse and transverse sections of wood. The corresponding mechanical parameters in the following established theoretical model are equally related with the mentioned wood surfaces.|$|E

A juvenile-mature pattern of variation was observed in ray area and ray density. Ray area increased in the inner part of stem and fluctuated around a certain value in the outer part of the stem, and ray density decreased in the inner part of stem and tended to be constant in the outer part of the stem. The maturation age of ray density was similar to the age at the boundary between the early and the middle stages of radial stem increment, but ray area and ray proportion did not relate to the stages of radial stem increment.|$|E

40|$|The {{microfibril}} angle (MFA) of crystalline cellulose {{in the wood}} cell wall along the stem axis has major effects on stiffness and longitudinal shrinkage of wood and is of key importance to timber quality. The aims of this study were: (1) to develop partial least square (PLS) regression models for {{microfibril angle}} (measured on <b>tangential</b> <b>sections</b> by X-ray diffraction) based on NIR spectra measured on tangential and on radial surfaces; (2) to develop PLS regression models for MFA based on radial NIR spectra collected from wood surfaces of different quality; and (3) to verify the reliability of these PLS-R models by external validations. T values were recorded by X-ray diffraction on <b>tangential</b> <b>sections</b> while NIR spectra were taken on tangential and radial wood surfaces. PLS-R calibrations for MFA based on tangential NIR spectra were better (r 2 p = 0. 72) than those using radial NIR spectra (r 2 p = 0. 64). The key role of the chemical components {{and the effect of}} surface quality of wood on NIR spectroscopy calibrations are discussed. Considering the differences between experimental conditions, these findings showed the potential of the NIR-based models for predicting MFA in Eucalyptus wood, even using spectra taken from different wood faces and surface qualities.

40|$|In {{various species}} {{and areas of}} the {{cerebral}} cortex, apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons form clusters which extend through several layers of the cortex also known as dendritic bundles. Previously, {{it has been shown}} that 5 -HT 3 A receptor knockout mice show hypercomplex apical dendrites of cortical layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons, together with a reduction in reelin levels, a glycoprotein involved in cortical development. Other studies showed that in the mouse presubicular cortex, reelin is involved in the formation of modular structures. Here, we compare apical dendrite bundling in the somatosensory cortex of wildtype and 5 -HT 3 A receptor knockout mice. Using a microtubule associated protein- 2 immunostaining to visualize apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, we compared dendritic bundle properties of wildtype and 5 -HT 3 A receptor knockout mice in <b>tangential</b> <b>sections</b> of the somatosensory cortex. A Voronoi tessellation was performed on immunostained <b>tangential</b> <b>sections</b> to determine the spatial organization of dendrites and to define dendritic bundles.
