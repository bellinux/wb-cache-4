5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final. It was assembled and marketed by German sport firm Adidas, and was the ninth ball in the European Championship series, as well {{as part of the}} Adidas Finale. The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making it more comfortable <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> and smoother to control. The Terrestra Silverstream was later unveiled as {{the official}} match ball of the UEFA Euro 2000.|$|E

Its limb control system {{allowed it to}} walk with the lower limbs, and <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E

When two S.latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or {{to engage in a}} tug of war.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a granivore {{and adapted}} for {{the consumption of}} seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and agile feet <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard <b>to</b> <b>grip,</b> and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch {{on the fourth day}} so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E
5|$|Once a colossus is found, {{the player}} must {{discover}} its weaknesses to defeat it.

5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced <b>to</b> <b>Grip</b> Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult <b>to</b> <b>grip.</b> The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{passed his}} century and began {{accelerating}} before finally falling for 141, leaving Australia at 2/296 in 277 minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball off the inside edge, but Miller survived a loud lbw appeal on Yardley's hat-trick ball. Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century {{in his last}} Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time because of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but Bedser then moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. It was the fourth time out of four innings in the series that Bedser had dismissed Bradman. This left Australia at 4/329 and the next day, Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch {{so that he could}} attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. The Australian captain declared on the following day of play at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. England lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> {{the inside of a}} shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced <b>to</b> <b>Grip</b> Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would be accessible to all players.|$|E
