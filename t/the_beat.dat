5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is punctuated by a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> and the upper strings those off <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> This leads into the second fugato episode in the key of C minor.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> from the music.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved method for simulating and modifying <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect in piano tones. <b>The</b> <b>beating</b> effect is an audible phenomenon, which is characteristic to the piano, and, hence, {{it should be}} accounted for in realistic piano synthesis. The proposed method, which is independent of the synthesis technique, contains a cascade of second-order equalizing filters, where each filter produces <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect for a single partial by modulating the peak gain. Moreover, the method offers a way to control <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> frequency and <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> depth, {{and it can be}} used to modify <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> envelope in existing tones. The results show that the proposed method is able to simulate <b>the</b> desired <b>beating</b> effect. 1...|$|R

5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and exhalation should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air deep within for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E
5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> in the oboes and off <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> in the alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5|$|Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in {{particular}} {{were influenced by}} the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry.

5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major.

5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them....

5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> or moving through <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game called}} kitsune-ken (fox-fist) references the kitsune's powers over human beings.

40|$|Although prostanoids {{are known}} to be {{involved}} in regulation of <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>beating</b> rate of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the various subtypes of prostanoid receptors have not been investigated in detail. In our experiments, prostaglandin (PG) F 2 a and prostanoid FP receptor agonists (fluprostenol, latanoprost and cloprostenol) produced a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate. Two prostanoid IP receptor agonists (iloprost and beraprost) induced first a marked drop in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate and then definitive abrogation of <b>beating.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> prostanoid DP receptor agonists (PGD 2 and BW 245 C) and TP receptor agonists (U- 46619) produced increases in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate. Sulprostone (a prostanoid EP 1 and EP 3 receptor agonist) induced marked increases in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate, which were suppressed by SC- 19220 (a selective prostanoid EP 1 antagonist). Butaprost (a selective prostanoid EP 2 receptor agonist), misoprostol (a prostanoid EP 2 and EP 3 receptor agonist), 11 -deoxy-PGE 1 (a prostanoid EP 2, EP 3 and EP 4 receptor agonist) did not alter <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate. Our results strongly suggest that prostanoid EP 1 receptors are involved in positive regulation of <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> rate. Prostanoid EP 1 receptor expression was confirmed by western blotting with a selective antibody. Hence, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes express both prostanoid IP and FP receptors (which negatively regulate <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>beating</b> rate) and prostanoid TP, DP 1 and EP 1 receptors (which positively regulate <b>the</b> spontaneous <b>beating</b> rate) ...|$|R

5|$|The social {{repression}} of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named <b>the</b> <b>Beat</b> poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E
