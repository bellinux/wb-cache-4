50|$|Screen {{scraping}} {{is normally}} {{associated with the}} programmatic collection of visual data from a source, instead of parsing data as in Web scraping. Originally, screen scraping referred {{to the practice of}} reading text data from a computer display terminal's screen. This was generally done by reading the terminal's memory through its auxiliary port, or by connecting the <b>terminal</b> <b>output</b> port of one computer system to an input port on another. The term screen scraping is also commonly used to refer to the bidirectional exchange of data.

5000|$|Pressing the [...] {{key in the}} Linux console while text is {{scrolling}} {{through the}} screen freezes the console output (but not input) — during which no further text is printed on the screen, but the program keeps on running as usual. When [...] is pressed again the screen is unfrozen and all text generated during the freeze is printed at once. This allows the user to pause the display and read long messages that scroll through the screen too quickly to read, for example when the system is booting up (provided the keyboard driver has already been loaded).

5000|$|A popular {{program called}} [...] "flash", which sent malformed {{information}} via the talk protocol, was frequently used by pranksters to corrupt the <b>terminal</b> <b>output</b> of the unlucky {{target in the}} early 1990s. It did this by including terminal commands in the field normally designated for providing {{the name of the}} person making the request. When the victim would receive the talk request, the name of the person sending the request would be displayed on their screen. This would cause the terminal commands to execute, rendering the person's display unreadable until they reset it. Later versions of talk blocked flash attempts and alerted the user that one had taken place. Later it became clear that, by sending different terminal commands, it is even possible to have the user execute commands. As it has proven impossible to fix all programs that output untrusted data to the terminal, modern terminal emulators have been rewritten to block this attack, though some may still be vulnerable.|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, {{work began}} on adding {{time-sharing}} capability to Exec 8. It was delivered with level 23 {{of the executive}} in 1969.

In demand mode, job stream I/O was attached to a terminal handler rather than card image (input) and spool (output) files. The same run control language was used for both. A few years later, more specific time sharing commands were added, and some control statements could be issued asynchronously for immediate processing, even when neither the executive or the running program were expecting data. Those commands, which could be entered only from a terminal, began with [...] "@@". Because they could be performed without stopping other work in progress from the same terminal, they were called transparent commands.

40|$|A {{high-order}} terminal iterative {{learning control}} (ILC) scheme is proposed where only the <b>terminal</b> <b>output</b> tracking error {{instead of the}} entire output trajectory tracking error is used to update the control profile.

40|$|The Double Modulation Converter (Dmc) Is A Dc-Ac Converter For Driving An Ac-Dc Converter.

The Other Output Line Connects The Other <b>Output</b> <b>Terminal</b> To One Of The Input Terminals. During Operation, The Two Switches Periodically And Alternately Open And Close, The Closure Of One Switch Causing A Pulse Of One Polarity To Appear Across The <b>Output</b> <b>Terminals,</b> And The Closure Of The Other Switch Causing A Pulse Of Opposite Polarity To Appear Across The <b>Output</b> <b>Terminals.</b> A Switch Is Closed Only When A Near-Zero Voltage Exists Across The Switch. In Order To Bring About This Result, A Diode And Capacitor Are Connected In Parallel With Each Switch And An Inductor Is Placed In Output Line. When One Switch Opens, The Other Switch Closes Only When There Is Less Than 0. 7 Volts Across The Switch. The Time Period During Which The Voltage Across The Switch To Be Closed Is Less Than 0. 7 Volts Is A Function Of The Resonant Frequency Of The Capacitance Associated With The Switch To Be Closed And The Inductance Associated With The Output Lines And The Load To Which The Output Lines Are Connected. One Or More Capacitors Are Placed In One Of The Output Lines To Block Dc.
