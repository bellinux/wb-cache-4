40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{friendship}} impacts upon the overall experience of mainstream school for autistic children. Using a unique combination of quantitative, qualitative and social-network methods, we investigated the extent and nature of autistic children’s <b>friendships</b> from <b>their</b> perspective and from those of their mothers, teachers and classroom peers. Consistent with previous research, children with autism (n= 12), aged between 9 and 11 years, rated <b>their</b> <b>friendships</b> to be of poorer quality than their non-autistic classroom peers (n= 11). There was, however, much variability in autistic children’s ratings, which, unexpectedly, was related to neither children’s cognitive ability nor their theory of mind ability. Encouragingly, the children generally reported satisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>friendships</b> and, although no child was socially isolated, the degree of inclusion in friendship networks varied widely. Furthermore, autistic children’s social motivation emerged as {{a key factor in}} parents’ and teachers’ reports in determining both {{the nature and extent of}} <b>their</b> <b>friendships.</b> Adults played an active role in supporting children’s friendships but this sometimes conflicted with what the children wanted. These findings highlight the need to ascertain the perspectives of young people with autism on <b>their</b> <b>friendships</b> and to consider the social and ethical implications of when and how to intervene...|$|R

40|$|The best friendships of emotionally distressed and typical young {{adolescents}} were investigated. A group of 5 th and 6 th grade {{young adolescents}} completed ratings on friendship quality {{and participated in}} videotaped friendship tasks. Emotional distress was identified using a T score cut-point of 60 on the Internalizing symptoms subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were 131 friendship dyads available for analyses. Of these, 48 were considered distressed dyads (24 female dyads; 24 male dyads) and 83 were considered typical dyads (47 female dyads; 36 male dyads). Results demonstrated similarity of internalizing symptoms between best friends of typical adolescents, but not distressed adolescents.

Distressed targets rated <b>their</b> <b>friendships</b> lower on validation/caring, help/guidance and total positive friendship quality than did typical targets. However, friends of distressed adolescents did not rate <b>their</b> <b>friendships</b> differently than friends of typical adolescents.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} effects {{of participation in}} the friendship enrichment program, an intervention that is designed to stimulate improvement in friendship, self-esteem and subjective well-being, as well as reduction in loneliness among older women. The intervention group was compared to a control group of women who were interested in the program or in improving <b>their</b> <b>friendships.</b> All respondents had been studied at three points in time: at a baseline, prior to the program; three months later, and 9 - 10 months after baseline. The results indicate that the program was successful in attracting lonely older women who were willing to work on <b>their</b> <b>friendships.</b> Many participants reported improvement in {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>their</b> <b>friendships.</b> The program was moderately successful in stimulating improvement in subjective well-being and awareness of the need for an active stance toward achieving goals in social relations, especially in friendship. Loneliness among the participants was reduced, but it also declined in the control group, and both groups continued to experience loneliness. One conclusion is that an effective intervention to help older women reduce their loneliness should be multi-dimensional focusing not only on friendship but also on other personal and situational factors contributing to loneliness...|$|R
