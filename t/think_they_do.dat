500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> have feelings {{for each other}} in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E

I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
