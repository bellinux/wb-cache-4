However, the availability of a durable <b>traffic</b> <b>simulator</b> capable of producing dynamic force is limited. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate a novel <b>traffic</b> <b>simulator</b> with improved durability and capable of producing dynamic force and 2) evaluate the bio-physical effects of the <b>traffic</b> <b>simulator</b> on a native soil turfgrass system. The Baldree <b>Traffic</b> <b>Simulator</b> is a modified Ryan GA 30 riding aerification unit, equipped with fabricated, spring loaded steel plate feet studded with screw in cleats. The effects of this unit on a ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L. ] Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) system established on a Tifton loamy sand (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) were evaluated at the Coastal Plains Experiment Station, Tifton, GA. Factors included location (1 and 2) and traffic rate (0, 12 and 24 passes applied over a 6 week period). Field data included soil bulk density, turf density, and percent green turf cover.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the application of}} Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Antithetic Variables (AVs) to reduce the variance of estimated performance measures from microscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>simulators.</b> LHS and AV allow for a more representative coverage of input probability distributions through stratification, reducing the standard error of simulation outputs. Two methods of implementation are examined, one where stratification is applied to headways and routing decisions of individual vehicles and another where vehicle counts and entry times are more evenly sampled. The proposed methods have wider applicability in general queuing systems. LHS is found to outperform AV, and reductions of up to 71 % in the standard error of estimates of traffic network performance relative to independent sampling are obtained. LHS allows for {{a reduction in the}} execution time of computationally expensive microscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>simulators</b> as fewer simulations are required to achieve a fixed level of precision with reductions of up to 84 % in computing time noted on the test cases considered.
