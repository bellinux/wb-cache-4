5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore <b>the</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
50|$|The input {{impedance}} of the circuit is almost zero {{because of the}} Miller effect. Hence all <b>the</b> stray <b>capacitances</b> (<b>the</b> cable <b>capacitance,</b> <b>the</b> amplifier input <b>capacitance,</b> etc.) are virtually grounded {{and they have no}} influence on the output signal.|$|R
25|$|It {{follows that}} <b>the</b> total <b>capacitance</b> of <b>the</b> {{capacitor}} Ce-cap is mainly determined by <b>the</b> anode <b>capacitance</b> CA when <b>the</b> cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is very large compared with <b>the</b> anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This requirement is given when <b>the</b> cathode <b>capacitance</b> CK is approximately 10 {{times higher than}} <b>the</b> anode <b>capacitance</b> CA. This can be easily achieved because the natural oxide layer on a cathode surface has a voltage proof of approximately 1.5V and is therefore very thin.|$|R
25|$|Measured with an AC {{measuring}} method with 100/120Hz <b>the</b> measured <b>capacitance</b> value is <b>the</b> closest {{value to the}} electrical charge stored in the capacitor. The stored charge is measured with a special discharge method and is called DC <b>capacitance.</b> <b>The</b> DC <b>capacitance</b> is about 10% higher than <b>the</b> 100/120Hz AC <b>capacitance.</b> <b>The</b> DC <b>capacitance</b> is of interest for discharge applications like photoflash.|$|R
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make <b>the</b> <b>capacitance</b> as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E
