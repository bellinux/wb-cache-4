500|$|On 11 November 2005, he and Rupert Grint {{presented}} Liz Carnell {{with the}} Daily Mirrors Pride of Britain Award {{for all of}} her work {{to raise awareness of}} the dangers of bullying. Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco. If they give me a line and I do not think it is something he would say, I suggest changing it. They do listen <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> do feel a part of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... becomes a part of you, and you [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will always be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E
500|$|Kat George of VH1 gave a {{positive}} review for the album, describing the scenes as [...] "moving, inspirational and infectious" [...] while also calling them [...] "immaculately produced." [...] She further wrote that [...] "Tight and succinct, there's no filler in the Live At Roseland DVD — it's high {{energy from the}} beginning to the end, and doesn't {{give you a chance to}} lag or lose interest." [...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really speaking <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that it was interesting to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E

2500|$|Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy {{in all of}} the Harry Potter films. Prior to landing {{the part}} of Malfoy, Felton auditioned to play Harry and Ron. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflects: [...] "I have had input into Draco. If they give me a line and I don't think it is {{something}} he would say, I suggest changing it. They do listen <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> do feel a part of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German {{language}} part of [...] "I treni di Tozeur" [...] {{performed by}} three female opera singers, [...] "Doch wir wollen dir ihn zeigen/Und du wirst...", is {{a quote from}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera or singspiel The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), Act II Scene 27, in its original form only a mere second in duration, 3 bars long, in 6/8 time, usually sung by three young boys or genii. The full sentence goes: [...] "Doch wir wollen dir ihn zeigen, und du wirst mit Staunen sehn, daß er dir sein Herz geweiht". Translated: [...] "Still {{we want to show}} him <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will with astonishment see that he consecrates his heart to you".|$|E
2500|$|When Ji Yan {{proposed}} introducing drastic {{reforms in}} the Wu administration (which included the dismissal of many officials he deemed incompetent), Lu Xun cautioned Sun Quan against that and accurately predicted that {{it would lead to}} problems. Lu Xun once told Zhuge Ke, [...] "I respect those who are superior to me in status; I assist those who are subordinate to me. I see you behave arrogantly in front of those superior <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> belittle those subordinate to you. This isn't the way to build a stable career." [...] In another incident, Yang Zhu (楊笁) became famous in his youth, but Lu Xun predicted that he was doomed to failure, so he advised Yang Zhu's elder brother, Yang Mu (楊穆), to break ties with Yang Zhu. Lu Xun's prediction came true as Yang Zhu later got into trouble during the Sun He-Sun Ba succession struggle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{deceleration}} of war {{included the}} Sancak-i Serif. Sancak-i Serif {{is used as}} a gathering point for the military units. The banner was occasionally carried into battles to encourage troops and ensure victory. The banner would be taken out of its box by the Sultan and affixed to a staff. He would carry it from the Chamber of the Holy Relics to the Throne Room while officials called out “God is great”. After this, the banner was carried from the Throne Room to the Gate of Felicity and placed there. The grand vizier would receive the banner from the sultan in a ceremony in the Throne Room. While the grand vizier and the şeyhülislâm stood in attendance, the sultan would kiss the Holy Banner and entrust it to his grand vizier with the words: “I entrust the Sacred Standard <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> to God. May He be your helper (a better translation: “May He become your Defender and Supporter”)!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> are as a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|E
