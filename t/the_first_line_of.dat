5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, {{a note of}} hope is struck by <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'. This refers to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray'. Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so also is persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted {{the forces of}} the defenders, further weakening the crew manning <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence. The garrison dropped to 28,000 regular soldiers and 10,000 fresh troops, poorly trained and often armed only with scythes.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the two stanzas of the chorale is identical. The tune {{is not a simple}} four-part setting as in most of Bach's later cantatas, but the voices are {{embedded}} in a concerto of the orchestra, led by violin I and oboe I. The instrumental theme is derived from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the chorale tune.|$|E

5|$|Across the battlefield, as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Persian ships {{was pushed}} {{back by the}} Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons {{appear to have been}} pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> trenches.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall the words of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% {{of respondents said they}} liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport was}} officially renamed McCarran International Airport in September 1968. Further {{expansion}} {{took place between}} 1970 and 1974 {{with the construction of}} the A and B gates. After the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, the number of airlines serving McCarran doubled from seven to fourteen in only two years. In response, the county launched an expansion plan named McCarran 2000, detailing expansion projects to be undertaken into the year 2000. Expanded baggage claim facilities, an esplanade, and a parking garage were inaugurated in 1985. The C Gates and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the people mover system followed in 1987.|$|E

5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If assailants made it past <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence they would {{be caught in the}} killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E

5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> treatment.|$|E

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first subway opened in 1904, the lines had been {{consolidated}} into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended {{to compete with the}} private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but stayed within the core of the City due to its small startup capital. This required it to be run 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{suffering}} a significant setback at the outset, when {{part of their}} small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Allied aircraft as they attempted {{to land on the}} coast behind the Australian defenders, the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields. Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence. These troops were steadily pushed back, but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This was the {{beginning}} of a new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich’s industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection. He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|South Indian mercenaries {{were often}} {{employed}} in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages. Manavamma and Moggallana I (491–508) obtained {{the assistance of the}} Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne. However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king. Gajabahu I also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, and brought back 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives. Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. This would have been <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> defence for the island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India.|$|E
