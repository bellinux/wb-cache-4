2500|$|A third type of heat {{exchanger}} is {{a plate and}} shell {{heat exchanger}}, which combines plate heat exchanger with shell and <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> technologies. The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together. Nozzles carry flow {{in and out of}} the platepack (the 'Plate side' flowpath). The fully welded platepack is assembled into an outer shell that creates a second flowpath ( [...] the 'Shell side'). Plate and shell technology offers high heat transfer, high pressure, high operating temperature, uling and close approach temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The {{research}} in this thesis focuses on the theoretical thermal modelling and design of a Latent Heat Storage system (LHS) for an absorption refrigeration machine. A shell-and-tube latent <b>heat</b> storage <b>exchanger</b> retaining any excess solar thermal energy is selected. Here, solar thermal energy supplied by a collector is transferred to and stored by the LHS. During low insolation, stored thermal energy is transferred by a Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) into the generator, a component of an Ammonia Absorption Refrigerator (AAAR), to ensure efficiency of the cooling cycle. The shell-and-tube LHS contains Phase Change Material (PCM) which fills space outside the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The HTF flowing through the tubes exchanges thermal energy with the PCM. The selection of a suitable PCM for a LHS is based on several factors. A primary criterion for an efficient, reliable storage unit is the correct melting point of the PCM at a desired operating temperature of the heating application. An analytical model describing both the freezing process in the PCM and increased HTF temperature in the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is investigated. The model is developed using energy balance equations. It is solved in terms of dimensionless parameters. The thermal resistance of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is considered for this model. From {{the result of the}} analytical model, the design approach to size the LHS is provided and the different steps are given {{in order to determine the}} volume, mass, number of <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> inner and outer radius of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> and other parameters of the LHS. The dimensions of LHS are given as a function of a storage period, PCM properties, HTF properties, inner and outer radius of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> material of construction of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> and the nature of load on the heating process. Simulations from the analytical model developed are provided for the output thermal parameters of the storage system. These thermal parameters of the shell-and-tube latent exchanger are given in terms of the HTF outlet temperature, the front solidification of the PCM and the heat transfer rate during the solidification process of the PCM. A case study to demonstrate the application of the design approach with respect to the size shell-and-tube latent <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is provided. The integration of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> thermal conductivity in the modelling of the LHS resulted in an increase of 2 % in mass of the storage material compared to an analytical model neglecting the thermal conductivity of the <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The results of the model developed compared well with the results obtained from other analytical models at similar operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOptimization {{of shell}} and <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in {{industrial}} processes {{has always been}} a major goal for engineers and designers. The aim of the present study is to investigate application of alumina nanofluid to enhance the efficiency of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> while reducing energy consumption and overall cost. Alumina nanofluid increases the Nusselt number and thereby increases the heat transfer coefficient of shell and <b>tube</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> Increased <b>heat</b> transfer coefficients reduce the required tube length leading to reduced pressure drop in the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> In the case studied in this paper, over 185 % increase in <b>tube</b> side <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient allows reduction of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> length and flow velocity and thereby reduction of pressure drop up to 94 %.
