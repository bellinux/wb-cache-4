5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2013, Michigan (#1 AP/#2 Coaches) {{appeared}} on ESPN's College GameDay against Indiana (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) who hosted {{the game at}} Assembly Hall. Michigan lost 81–73, but the television broadcast of the game on ESPN set a Big Ten record for viewership with 4.035 million viewers. Morgan only played two minutes behind replacement starter Horford. Michigan then defeated Ohio State (#10 AP/#10 Coaches) in overtime in the rematch at home on February 5. Starting center Morgan only played 4 minutes. Coach Beilein noted that Morgan's absence affected the team's ability <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> defensively and substitute as it desired.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1994-1995 college {{football}} season, the Gator Bowl was snubbed by the newly formed Bowl Alliance, a group of football conferences, bowl games, and television networks created <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the No. 1 and No. 2 college football teams at the conclusion of each season. Though the Gator Bowl offered to pay $115 million for the right to become a Bowl Alliance game, the Orange Bowl was selected in place of the Gator Bowl. This event had repercussions at the end of the season, when the bowl was passed over by high-ranked teams that elected to accept bids to bowls in the new Bowl Alliance.|$|E

Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were not expected <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the frequency {{distribution of the}} letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Virginia Tech {{received}} its first bid to a Bowl Coalition game. The Bowl Coalition, predecessor {{to the modern}} Bowl Championship Series, was intended <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> the two best teams in the Sugar, Orange, Fiesta, and Rose Bowls, with the two highest-ranked teams playing in a National Championship Game. Following the 1995-1996 college football season, Virginia Tech was selected {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl {{as a result of this}} coalition. The No. 13 Hokies, who finished 9–2 during the regular season and were named Big East Conference champions, played against the No. 9 University of Texas, who finished 10–1–1 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>up</b> against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
