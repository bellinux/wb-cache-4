5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by meteorologist and <b>tornado</b> expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond <b>Tornado</b> was the first determined F/EF5 in American history to cause a death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez <b>tornado</b> has never been officially determined and the St. Louis-East St. Louis <b>tornado</b> ranked as only an F/EF4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie <b>tornado</b> outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville <b>tornado</b> outbreak tornadoes have also both been classified as only F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond <b>Tornado</b> the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E
5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State <b>Tornado</b> Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} <b>tornado</b> {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a <b>tornado</b> in 1728 or 1729. This <b>tornado</b> was nearly as violent as the Wallingford <b>Tornado</b> of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the <b>tornado</b> lifted outside of the town. What may have been another <b>tornado</b> caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another <b>tornado</b> struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|In Terms of fatalities, the New Richmond <b>Tornado</b> {{presently}} {{ranks as}} the ninth deadliest <b>tornado</b> in United States history. At {{the time of its}} occurrence, it ranked as the third deadliest <b>tornado</b> in American history, outflanked only by the 1840 Great Natchez <b>Tornado</b> and the 1896 St. Louis-East St. Louis <b>tornado.</b> Since 1899, the record has only been surpassed six times, those being the Amite-Purvis <b>Tornado</b> in 1908, the Tri-State <b>Tornado</b> in 1925, the Tupelo and Gainesville tornadoes in 1936, the 1947 Woodward <b>Tornado</b> and most recently the 2011 Joplin <b>Tornado.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tornadoes</b> vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong <b>tornadoes</b> are typically larger than weak <b>tornadoes.</b> The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track (and longer lived) <b>tornadoes</b> {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent <b>tornadoes,</b> {{only a small portion}} of the path area is of violent intensity; most of the higher intensity is from subvortices. In the United States, 80% of <b>tornadoes</b> are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) <b>tornadoes.</b> The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent <b>tornadoes</b> (EF4, T8 or stronger).|$|R
5|$|Although this is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} theory for how most <b>tornadoes</b> form, live, and die, it does not explain the formation of smaller <b>tornadoes,</b> such as landspouts, long-lived <b>tornadoes,</b> or <b>tornadoes</b> with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most <b>tornadoes</b> follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|R

5|$|RAF IDS {{variants}} {{were initially}} designated the <b>Tornado</b> GR1 with later modified aircraft designated <b>Tornado</b> GR1A, <b>Tornado</b> GR1B, <b>Tornado</b> GR4 and <b>Tornado</b> GR4A. The first of 228 GR1s was delivered on 5 June 1979, {{and the type}} entered service in the early 1980s. A total of 142 aircraft were upgraded to GR4 standard from 1997 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua <b>tornado</b> was {{an intense}} <b>tornado</b> that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this <b>tornado</b> ranks as the strongest <b>tornado</b> to touch down in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The <b>tornado</b> formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The <b>tornado</b> quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the <b>tornado</b> dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The <b>tornado</b> {{is known as the}} worst disaster in the history of Chappaqua.|$|E
5|$|The Panavia <b>Tornado</b> is {{a family}} of twin-engine, variable-sweep wing multirole combat aircraft, which was jointly {{developed}} and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. There are three primary <b>Tornado</b> variants: the <b>Tornado</b> IDS (interdictor/strike) fighter-bomber, the suppression of enemy air defences <b>Tornado</b> ECR (electronic combat/reconnaissance) and the <b>Tornado</b> ADV (air defence variant) interceptor aircraft.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tornadoes</b> in Japan are {{different}} from those in the USA; Japanese <b>tornadoes</b> have an intensity equal to or less than F 3 on the Fujita scale, and the low-level atmosphere in Japan is much more humid. Ensemble experiments to reproduce Japanese <b>tornadoes</b> are desirable for improving the forecast accuracy of <b>tornadoes</b> in Japan and for understanding the generation mechanisms of Japanese <b>tornadoes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|South Carolina averages around 64 days of {{thunderstorm}} activity per year. Most thunderstorms {{occur during}} the summer. South Carolina {{is vulnerable to}} <b>tornadoes.</b> Some notable <b>tornadoes</b> have struck South Carolina and the state averages around 14 <b>tornadoes</b> annually. [...] There have been no F-5 <b>tornadoes</b> on record but over a dozen F-4 <b>tornadoes</b> have occurred in many counties in South Carolina.|$|R
5|$|The fourth <b>tornado</b> of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the <b>tornado</b> struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the <b>tornado</b> dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} <b>tornado</b> and damages amounted to $30,000. The <b>tornado</b> was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth <b>tornado</b> of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the <b>tornado</b> destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the <b>tornado</b> struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the <b>tornado</b> blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the <b>tornado</b> and damages amounted to $75,000. The <b>tornado</b> was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} <b>tornado</b> to cause F5/EF5 damage in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park <b>tornado</b> on March 3, 1966. Additionally, the {{formation}} of the Smithville <b>tornado</b> later that day marked the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF5 tornadoes have been recorded in Mississippi on the same day. Prior to this, the last confirmed EF5 <b>tornado</b> was the Parkersburg, Iowa <b>tornado</b> on May 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tornado</b> myths are {{incorrect}} {{beliefs about}} tornadoes, {{which can be}} attributed to many factors, including stories and news reports told by people unfamiliar with tornadoes, sensationalism by news media, and the presentation of incorrect information in popular entertainment. Common myths cover various aspects of the <b>tornado,</b> and include ideas about <b>tornado</b> safety, the minimization of <b>tornado</b> damage, and false assumptions about the size, shape, power, and path of the <b>tornado</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tornadoes</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} in every U.S. state (not including the non-state territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico) at least once since 1950, although some regions and states are hit by <b>tornadoes</b> far more than others. For example, {{the average number of}} <b>tornadoes</b> to hit the states of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Vermont is less than one, while the state of Oklahoma receives an average of 52 <b>tornadoes</b> per year, and the state of Texas is hit with 126 <b>tornadoes</b> in an average year. The state with the most <b>tornadoes</b> per unit area is Florida, though most are weak <b>tornadoes</b> of EF0 or EF1 intensity. A number of Florida's <b>tornadoes</b> occur along the edge of hurricanes that strike the state. The state with the highest number of strong <b>tornadoes</b> per unit area is Oklahoma. States such as Oklahoma and Kansas have much lower population densities than Florida, so <b>tornadoes</b> may go unreported.|$|R
5000|$|... 180 <b>tornadoes</b> were {{reported}} in the U.S. in March. The Chicago area received the most <b>tornadoes</b> ever recorded, including several F2 and F3 <b>tornadoes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>tornadoes</b> are designated EF1 or EF0, also known as [...] "weak" [...] <b>tornadoes.</b> However, weak is a relative term for <b>tornadoes,</b> as even these can cause significant damage.

5|$|Tri-State <b>Tornado</b> – Deadliest <b>tornado</b> in North America, {{and made}} March 18, 1925 the deadliest <b>tornado</b> day {{recorded}} in United States.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe weather was issued for April 26 for {{portions}} of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas along and near the Interstate 30 corridor as conditions became even more favorable for extreme weather. A large PDS <b>tornado</b> watch with very high <b>tornado</b> probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread <b>tornado</b> warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{anticyclonic}} multivortex satellite <b>tornado</b> also formed {{southeast of}} the primary <b>tornado</b> at approximately 6:28pmCDT (2328UTC), and remained {{on the ground for}} 15 minutes before lifting at 6:43 (2343UTC). Such companion tornadoes tend to be observed with especially large and intense tornadoes, although this was the first documented multiple-vortex anticyclonic <b>tornado</b> of this kind.|$|E
50|$|In all, the two {{consecutive}} outbreaks {{killed at least}} 241 people and caused at least 19 <b>tornadoes,</b> though only significant events were recorded and other, weaker <b>tornadoes</b> may have gone undetected. The outbreak sequence also produced seven violent <b>tornadoes,</b> nearly half the documented total of <b>tornadoes</b> for the sequence. <b>Tornadoes</b> struck Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana. At least $9.68 million in damages were reported.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the three-day}} period, 73 <b>tornadoes</b> were confirmed. The {{high number of}} overall <b>tornadoes</b> is exaggerated, however, {{by the fact that}} most were weak F0 or F1 <b>tornadoes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>tornadoes</b> are designated EF1 or EF0, also known as [...] "weak" [...] <b>tornadoes.</b> However, weak is a relative term for <b>tornadoes,</b> as even these can cause significant damage.

5|$|An {{aerial survey}} later {{determined}} that the damage across the seven counties was caused by one continuous <b>tornado,</b> with a track estimated at 122miles (196km) in length. This was the longest single <b>tornado</b> track recorded in Arkansas since detailed record keeping began in 1950. Thirteen people were killed by this <b>tornado,</b> and about 140 people were injured. At least 200 homes and businesses were destroyed along the tornado's path. Damage from this <b>tornado</b> was estimated at nearly $120 million across the seven counties.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 <b>tornado</b> outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a <b>tornado</b> as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a <b>tornado,</b> and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak <b>tornado,</b> the <b>tornado</b> did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma <b>tornado</b> outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same <b>tornado</b> outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{has seen}} 58 F5 and EF5 (the highest {{intensity}} and damage ranking) <b>tornadoes</b> since records began in 1950. No <b>tornadoes</b> prior to 1950 were officially ranked F5, due to inadequate engineering data {{and other information}} on the historical <b>tornadoes.</b> From 1950 - 1970 <b>tornadoes</b> were assessed retrogressively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, and newspaper photographs and descriptions. Beginning in 1971, <b>tornadoes</b> were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys.|$|R

5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the <b>Tornado</b> {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the <b>Tornado</b> as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the <b>Tornado</b> ECR. The most extensive modification from the base <b>Tornado</b> design was the <b>Tornado</b> ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} thought that <b>tornadoes</b> only occur in North America. The {{majority}} of <b>tornadoes</b> do {{occur in the}} United States; however, <b>tornadoes</b> have been observed on every continent except Antarctica.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>tornadoes</b> {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. <b>Tornadoes</b> may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These <b>tornadoes</b> are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. <b>Tornadoes</b> can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{round of}} severe weather {{developed}} late that evening, producing another intense squall line with embedded <b>tornadoes</b> across the northern Gulf Coast region early on March 27, where several <b>tornadoes</b> were reported.
