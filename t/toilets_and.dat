5000|$|In the United States, {{there is}} a lack of a single, {{universal}} definition; this commonly results in discrepancies between advertised and actual number of baths in real estate listings. Bathrooms are generally categorized as [...] "master bathroom", containing a shower and a bathtub that is adjoining to the largest bedroom; a [...] "full bathroom" [...] (or [...] "full bath"), containing four plumbing fixtures: a <b>toilet</b> <b>and</b> sink, and either a bathtub with a shower, or a bathtub and a separate shower stall; [...] "half (1/2) bath" [...] (or [...] "powder room") containing just a <b>toilet</b> <b>and</b> sink; and [...] "3/4 bath" [...] containing <b>toilet,</b> sink, <b>and</b> shower, although the terms vary from market to market. In some U.S. markets, a <b>toilet,</b> sink, <b>and</b> shower are considered a [...] "full bath." [...] In addition, there is the use of the word [...] "bathroom" [...] to describe a room containing a <b>toilet</b> <b>and</b> a basin, and nothing else.|$|R
