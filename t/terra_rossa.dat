50|$|Its fossilized {{remains were}} {{retrieved}} {{in the late}} sixties and subsequent years from reworked reddish, massive or crudely stratified silty-sandy clays (<b>terrae</b> <b>rossae),</b> which partially fill the paleo-karstic fissures in the Mesozoic limestone substrate and that are on their turn overlain by Late-Pliocene-Early Pleistocene sediments of a subsequently marine, shallow water and terrigenous origin. In this way a buried paleokarst originated.|$|R
50|$|The surface {{features}} of the ancient karst developed in Mesozoic limestone. In these, sediment accumulated together with {{the remains of the}} local fauna, forming thick layers of reddish, massive or crudely stratified silty-sandy clays, known as <b>terrae</b> <b>rossae</b> ("red soils"). Through the mid-Pliocene, some of these deposits were flooded, probably due to tectonic movement of the Apulian Plate. Others were overlaid by other sediments of terrestrial or freshwater origin. In this way a buried, partially reworked paleokarst originated.|$|R
40|$|On the {{controversial}} nature of paleosols related to shallow marine carbonate depositional environments Recognition {{of the importance}} of exposure related features in shallow water carbonate sequences dates back to the late fifties–early sixties. They have raised interest first among sedimentologists working in carbonate diagenesis, then, as soon as the obvious implications in petroleum geology were recognized the study of paleosols/paleokarst and the related porosity evolution began to receive considerable industrial support. Paleosols occurring in shallow marine carbonate sequences are generally divided into two main groups: (a) paleosols related to long-lasting (tectonically controlled) exposure at major regional unconformities, (b) intraformational paleosols occurring in cyclically organized sequences where marine sedimentation is repeatedly interrupted by shorter or longer episodes of non-deposition and subaerial exposure (of either intrinsic or extrinsic control). Representatives of the first group are bauxites, <b>terrae</b> <b>rossae</b> and certain calcretes. They have received attention mainly from scholars of paleokarst and bauxites and much less from soil scientists proper. The reason for that is probably that they are soil derived sediments rather than in situ soils. Because of the long exposure and the associated usually mature paleorelief they are often used as paleotopographic indicators in areas whic...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) used earth colors, {{including}} ochre and sienna, in his frescos, {{including this}} {{painting in the}} Hall of the Five Hundred at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. In his writings Vasari called sienna <b>terra</b> <b>rossa.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pigment sienna {{was known}} and used, {{in its natural}} form, by the ancient Romans. It was mined near Arcidosso, {{formerly}} under Sienese control, now {{in the province of}} Grosseto, on Monte Amiata in southern Tuscany. It was called <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> (red earth), terra gialla, or terra di Siena. During the Renaissance, it was noted by the most widely read author about painting techniques, Giorgio Vasari, under the name <b>terra</b> <b>rossa.</b> It became, along with umber and yellow ochre, one of the standard browns used by artists from the 16th to 19th centuries, including Caravaggio (1571-1610) and Rembrandt (1606-1669), who used all the earth colours, including ochre, sienna and umber, in his palette.|$|E
50|$|It {{grows on}} the rocky and stony mountain-sides, {{at the edges of}} woodlands, or in scrub land. It can be found on heavy, {{limestone}} clays, basalt (rocks), or <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> and soft chalky rocks.They can be found at an altitude of up to 1300 m above sea level.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{so called}} [...] "bijela", [...] "siva", [...] "crvena" [...] Istra, (white, grey and red Istria).

50|$|The Mount Benson {{vineyards}} {{are planted}} on gently undulating terrain ranging {{from five to}} 50 metres above sea level and attracted the interest of viticulturalists due to prevalent loam-based <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soils that sit atop free-draining limestone, which formed {{over millions of years}} while the region was underwater. Shells and skeletal remains of marine animals deposited on the shallow sands of what is now the Limestone Coast, and under the ocean’s weight these remains fused together to form a layer of soft limestone. <b>Terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soil, arguably the most famous vineyard soil in Australia, is produced as the limestone weathers and the clay contained in the rocks is left behind. Where this clay sits above the water table oxidation occurs, forming rust and giving the soil is characteristic red colour.|$|E
50|$|In 1113, Renier donated his {{portion of}} the Langiano to the monastery of San Secondo di <b>Terra</b> <b>Rossa,</b> {{affiliated}} with the Abbey of Fruttuaria. On 23 May 1116, Renier was present with the Emperor when the latter bestowed the castles of Celle, Frassinello, Fubine, and Cuccaro on his nephew Conrad and Guido Cane.|$|E
5000|$|The Coonawarra covers an area {{centred on}} the strip of land {{adjoining}} {{both sides of the}} Riddoch Highway mainly north of the town of Penola and is bordered by the Wrattonbilly region in the north, by the Mount Gambier region in the south and by the Victorian border in the east. It is known for the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in its <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soil. For years there were disputes within the Coonawarra region about which vineyards could rightfully be considered [...] "Coonawarra", and which were outside the boundaries. The soil itself became the deciding factor, with the lands with red <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soil being visually distinguishable from the black soil found interspersed throughout the region. In addition to Cabernet, the region has also found some success with its Chardonnay, Malbec, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Pinot noir, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon and Shiraz.|$|E
50|$|Fortunes {{changed when}} Samuel Wynn {{recognised}} {{the potential of}} the strip of <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soil, and bought the original Riddoch cellars in 1951. Led by Wynns and Penfolds, Coonawarra was to play {{a leading role in the}} transformation of the Australian wine industry as it changed from making fortified wines to conventional table wines.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} running {{research}} projects in Jordan {{found that the}} erosion of the main agricultural soil, the <b>Terra</b> <b>Rossa,</b> took place {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age and during the Younger Dryas. It seems therefore that erosion of the today intensively used soils was limited during historical periods, and not connected with desertification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terra</b> <b>rossa</b> {{occurs in}} areas where heavy {{rainfall}} dissolves carbon from the calcium carbonate parent rock and silicates are leached out of the soil to leave residual deposits that are rich in iron hydroxides, {{the cause of the}} red colour. Such areas are usually depressions within the limestone, or areas where the vegetation is garrigue (low-lying scrub).|$|E

5000|$|Teran or Terrano - this refosko variety (and wine) {{is typical}} for Carso DOC and Slovenian Karst region {{under the name}} Teranno Carso or Kraški teran respectively. It is also grown in Croatian Istria on a very similar red soil under the name Istarski Teran. Some say that Teran is just other refosko {{varieties}} grown on <b>Terra</b> <b>Rossa,</b> while others consider it its own variety.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Terra</b> <b>rossa</b> ( [...] Italian for [...] "red soil") {{is a type}} of {{red clay}} soil {{produced}} by the weathering of limestone. When limestone weathers, the clay contained in the rocks is left behind, along with any other non-soluble rock material. Under oxidizing conditions, when the soils are above the water table, iron oxide (rust) forms in the clay. This gives it a characteristic red to orange colour.|$|E
5000|$|Indigenous Teran wine is {{produced}} exclusively from Teran grapes, a wine {{under the same}} name is made of Refosco grapes grown on <b>Terra</b> <b>Rossa,</b> which is the Slovenian produced [...] "Kraški teran", therefore it is often a misnomer when different synonyms may be used: Cagnina (in Emilia-Romagna), Crodarina, Gallizio, Gallizza, Istranin, Istranyun, Istrianka, Istrijanac, Istrijanka, Magnacan, Reffosco, Refosca, Refosco D'Istria, Refosco del Carso, Refosco Magnacan, Refoscone, Refošk, Refošk Istarski and Rifosco.|$|E
50|$|Coonawarra's <b>terra</b> <b>rossa</b> soil {{is one of}} {{the notable}} terroirs of the New World, {{covering}} an area of just 15 km x 2 km north of Penola. It lies on a shallow limestone ridge, raising it above the swampy land either side - {{it is no coincidence that}} the Riddoch Highway follows this ridge as carters sought the firmest ground in times past. This special bright red soil is clearly visible on an aerial photo.|$|E
