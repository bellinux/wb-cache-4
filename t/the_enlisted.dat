5|$|At NSGL, <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> African Americans who {{tested in}} the top 30 to 40 percent were {{selected}} for non-labor battalion assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's future {{had been}} {{referred}} to Sixth Army Group, the controlling formation, for further consideration; after some debate, they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men of the unit. The second inspection showed that <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men were broadly competent at their duties, but {{that most of them}} preferred rear-area duties over combat roles. The inspection recommended that <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men be transferred to one of the segregated infantry divisions. In the event, the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters, where it was used in a service role. It remained nominally active—to avoid the political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit—but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit.|$|E
5|$|Munitions transported {{through the}} {{magazine}} included bombs, shells, naval mines, torpedoes, and small arms ammunition. The munitions, {{destined for the}} Pacific Theater of Operations, were delivered to the Port Chicago facility by rail then individually loaded by hand, crane and winch onto cargo ships for transport to the war zones. From the beginning, all <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men employed as loaders at Port Chicago were African-American; all their commanding officers were white. All of <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men had been specifically trained {{for one of the}} naval ratings during his stay at Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) but the men were instead put to work as stevedores. None of the new recruits had been instructed in ammunition loading.|$|E

40|$|We {{wished to}} {{validate}} our recently devised 16 -item ENLIST ENL Severity Scale, a clinical tool {{for measuring the}} severity of the serious leprosy associated complication of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). We also wished to assess the responsiveness of <b>the</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale in detecting clinical change in patients with ENL. Participants, recruited from seven centres in six leprosy endemic countries, were assessed using <b>the</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale by two researchers, one of whom categorised the severity of ENL. At a subsequent visit a further assessment using the scale was made and both participant and physician rated the change in ENL using the subjective categories of "Much better", "somewhat better", "somewhat worse" and "much worse" compared with "No change" or "about the same". 447 participants were assessed with <b>the</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale. The Cronbach alpha of the scale and each item was calculated to determine the internal consistency of <b>the</b> scale. <b>The</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale had good internal consistency and this improved following removal of six items to give a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 77. The cut off between mild ENL and more severe disease was 9 determined using ROC curves. The minimal important difference of the scale was determined to be 5 using both participant and physician ratings of change. <b>The</b> 10 -item <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale is the first valid, reliable and responsive measure of ENL severity and improves our ability to assess and compare patients and their treatments in this severe and difficult to manage complication of leprosy. <b>The</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale will assist physicians in the monitoring and treatment of patients with ENL. <b>The</b> <b>ENLIST</b> ENL Severity Scale is easy to apply and will be useful as an outcome measure in treatment studies and enable the standardisation of other clinical and laboratory ENL research...|$|R
5|$|Monitor also {{required}} petty officers: {{among them was}} Daniel Toffey, Worden's nephew. Worden had selected Toffey to serve as his Captain's Clerk. Two black Americans were also among <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men in the crew. During Monitors service, commanders and several officers were replaced because of injuries or for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 49, {{with a college}} degree, or {{two years of college}} and two years of equivalent professional or business experience. <b>The</b> <b>enlisted</b> age requirements were between 20 and 35, with a high school or business diploma, or equivalent experience. United States citizenship was required in each case. WAVES were primarily white, middle class, and represented every state in the country. New York, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts and Ohio led the way.|$|E
5|$|The confederacy also {{implemented}} ready-made {{supplies of}} button, {{consisting of the}} U.S. Government stockpiles throughout the war.

5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no system}} at Port Chicago for making sure {{officers}} {{and men were}} familiar with safety regulations. Two formal lectures and several informal lectures were given to <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge did not take place. Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier but not {{within each of the}} barracksKinne did not think <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men would be able to comprehend such a list. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Each {{ship had}} {{a crew of}} 854{{officers}} and enlisted men. <b>The</b> <b>enlisted</b> crew spaces were located forward in the upper deck, and were cramped and unhygienic. The cabins for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime I wore two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime I was also repainted dark gray at this time.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, link trainer operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio technicians, and motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E

Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> cabins was set aside, and all six bunks in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting opportunities and help make up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E

5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1780, Washington issued orders {{approved}} by Congress that specified {{plans for the}} comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1, 1781.

The much-diminished unit comprised only 2 officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780. The officers received discharges on January 1, 1781, and <b>the</b> <b>enlisted</b> men of the unit were transferred to the Maryland Line. Relocation of the men from their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments, however, was not completed until November 1781, at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process.|$|E
