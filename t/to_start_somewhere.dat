For {{long term}} and {{sustainable}} economic development, countries have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from <b>somewhere.</b> Thus {{there is a}} distinction between short term planning and long term gaols setting. However countries like Pakistan have mostly fell {{into the trap of}} economic plans that focus on year to year goals setting or in other words macroeconomic stabilisation and usually fail to link policies with long term plans. The paper presents data that supports the hypothesis that it is the initiative of governments and not the donors to link long term economic progress with short term policies.

Of course, bridge builders have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from <b>somewhere</b> and the most promising constructors with a philosophy of science background are in my view Alvin Goldman (1999), Ilkka Niiniluoto (1999), and, last but not least, Jesús Zamora Bonilla (2000). In the latter’s contribution to this volume Zamora Bonilla continues his very specific project of clearly specifying a kind of research agenda for studying bridge issues, in critical response to Ilkka Kieseppä’s reservations about a methodological role {{of the theory of}} verisimilitude and David Resnik’s arguments against the explanation of scientific method by appeal to scientific aims.

40|$|Panspermia is {{the idea}} that life migrates {{naturally}} through space. Although an old idea, there has been much recent theoretical and experimental work developing the idea in recent years. In this review, this progress is considered and placed in context. Ideas concerning Panspermia now include mathematical treatments of the likelihood of transfer of life from Mars to Earth, the possibility of life transferring between the natural satellites of an outer planet such as Jupiter, and mathematical treatments and models of life migrating out of a Solar System. Not all predictions of the likelihood of successful Panspermia are positive, and some are contradictory. At present, Panspermia can neither be proved nor disproved. Nevertheless, Panspermia is an intellectual idea which holds strong attraction. However, at the heart of Panspermia is a still un-resolved mystery: in order to migrate, life has <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>somewhere,</b> and we still cannot tackle that moment of origin. ...|$|E

5000|$|Generation of {{the laser}} beam {{involves}} stimulating a lasing material by electrical discharges or lamps within a closed container. As the lasing material is stimulated, the beam is reflected internally {{by means of a}} partial mirror, until it achieves sufficient energy to escape as a stream of monochromatic coherent light. Mirrors or fiber optics are typically used to direct the coherent light to a lens, which focuses the light at the work zone. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than 0.0125 in. in diameter. Depending upon material thickness, [...] widths as small as 0.004 in are possible. In order to be able <b>to</b> <b>start</b> cutting from <b>somewhere</b> other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut.

Of course the Strategic Defence and Security Review, the practical measures by which they propose to implement the strategy, is full of flaws and absurdities.

40|$|In the Kiel classification, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas {{are divided}} into low grade and high grade {{categories}} [1]. The Working Formulation has an additional category of intermediate grade [2]. Histopathologists base their classification mainly on cell morphology: small cell (cystic) tumours are low grade, and large cell (blastic) tumours high grade. It is usually assumed that these morphological characteristics relate to the clinical behaviour of the neoplasm, and that low grade neoplasms will have an indolent clinical course, {{in contrast to the}} aggressive behaviour of high grade neoplasms. The study that established the Working Formulation supported this concept, although the intermediate grade encompasses both diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma (Kiel: centrocytic) and diffuse large cell lymphomas (Kiel: centroblastic). The sub-division of T cell lymphomas into low and high grade categories in the Kiel classification has been challenged on the grounds that insufficient data exist to reliably evaluate the clinical progress of these neoplasms [3]. This is a valid criticism but classifications have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>somewhere</b> and accumulated clinical data will eventually determine whether the histopathological classification of T cell lymphomas has relevance with respect to biological behaviour.

40|$|This paper {{discuss a}} {{relationship}} between mask and myth and how the appropriate analysis by Claude Levi-Strauss may make clearer a complex field of masks {{in the part of}} North America. Claude Levi-Strauss stressed the multi- layered character of myth structure. Similar multi-layered character can be seen at the level of expression, content and meaning of Salish, Kwakiutl and other unique masks of this part of North America. Claude Levi-Strauss analysed certain myths trying to explain ‘the path’ of the masks that belong to the people with similar languages, or those who lived nearby. The mythology of Tsimshian, Tlingit and Haïda people have certain common characteristics that point to the similarities with the nearby groups (Kwakiutl). Despite differences that exist at the level of meanings of the masks, there is also common ‘mythological heritage’ of the people who used to live in the Northern Pacific Coast. Claude Levi-Strauss showed that there is no final solution in the myth analysis, and that there is no possibility that the dissection of the problem will reveal some hidden unity. "As mythical though does not want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> clearly <b>somewhere</b> and come somewhere, it never goes through its whole trajectory: there is always something waiting to be fullfield. The same way as rituals, myths are infinite. " It seems that Levi-Strauss explanation of the Path of masks goes in that direction...|$|R
