5|$|Direct Ascent: The {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched {{as a unit}} and travel directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> land. It would return, leaving its landing stage on the Moon. This design would have required development of the extremely powerful Nova launch vehicle.|$|E

5|$|In a major {{space policy}} speech in April 2010, Obama {{announced}} a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended {{plans for a}} return of human spaceflight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>and</b> development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The Super-Heavy Lift Launcher (SHLL) would {{consist of}} a new {{cryogenic}} main stage, five liquid fly-back boosters, and a re-ignitable injection stage.

5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} surrounding the telescope's tracking of space probes, this only {{took up a}} fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations. These include using radar to measure the distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> to Venus; observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first gravitational lens and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.|$|E

5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining the whole body. Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>and</b> the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (goodness), Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the whole body, and nourish it.|$|E
5|$|Hanks {{made his}} debut as a {{director}} and screenwriter in the 1996 musical comedy That Thing You Do! Later in the same year, he founded with Gary Goetzman, his own film and television production company called Playtone. In 1998, Hanks executive produced the Emmy Award-winning docudrama miniseries From the Earth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> starred in Steven Spielberg-directed epic war film, Saving Private Ryan, which earned him his fourth nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Later that year, he reunited with Meg Ryan in another Ephron directed-romantic comedy, You've Got Mail. He also reprised his role in Toy Story, for its sequel, Toy Story 2. In 2000, Hanks starred in Cast Away, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Drama and a fifth nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2001, he executive produced Emmy Award-winning World War II mini-series Band of Brothers and the romantic comedy, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The following year {{at the age of}} 45, he became the youngest person to receive the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute. This was followed in 2004, by BAFTA Los Angeles awarding him the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.|$|E
