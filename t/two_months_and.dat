5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base. Mahesh met Sukumar {{on the set of}} Businessman (2012) in Goa, and listened to the script for 25 minutes. Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> considered it his dream project.|$|E

He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly because he was a capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry was anxious to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E

5|$|In December 2008, President-elect Barack Obama {{nominated}} two-term incumbent Senator Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, {{leaving an}} empty {{seat in the}} United States Senate. After <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> many potential names considered, then-Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand as the interim Senator from New York. Gillibrand was required to run in a special election in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} election campaign, {{the party was}} deeply divided and unable to organise an effective political strategy. It changed leaders five times in less than <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> in the 2002 general election decreased {{its share of the}} vote to 10.2%, almost two-thirds less than its previous share. Most of its voters sided with the ÖVP, which became the largest party in Austria with 43% of the vote. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the ÖVP and FPÖ was revived after the election; however, there was increasing criticism within the FPÖ against the party's mission of winning elections at any cost.|$|E

5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> based on the events {{surrounding}} the Communist Party and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah {{came at a time}} when literary works with similar themes– the victimisation of Communist Party members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its subject matter and criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E
5|$|When Genelia {{was offered}} a role in Tujhe Meri Kasam, {{initially}} she turned it down, as she was not keen {{to pursue a career}} in acting. But the crew insisted and kept contacting her for <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> she agreed when she saw the Telugu version of the movie. Tamil director, S. Shankar, was impressed with her performance in the Parker Pen commercial and decided to cast her in a leading role in his 2003 Tamil film Boys. Genelia was selected among 300 girls, who had auditioned for the movie. She signed three movies simultaneously in three different languages, Tujhe Meri Kasam (Hindi), Boys (Tamil), and Satyam (Telugu).|$|E

Vanstabel {{would bring the}} convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly would reinforce him {{for the rest of}} the journey. Together, these officers mustered six ships of the line and numerous smaller craft. The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed France for a year.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{sustained}} on 25 August 1990 kept Gibbs out for <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> {{once he had}} regained full fitness, {{his team}} were bottom of the table. His return coincided with a winless run of seven league matches, leaving Watford seven points from safety with nearly half the season gone. Nonetheless, Watford managed to climb to 20th place, and despite missing 14 games, Gibbs was once again shortlisted for the club's end of season award. In 1991–92 Gibbs finally became Player of the Season. Missing only three matches, he rounded off a good season by scoring his first goal in four years in Watford's last league game, cementing a top-ten finish in the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|As the day (26 January 1965) of {{switching}} over to Hindi as sole {{official language}} approached, the anti-Hindi movement gained momentum in Madras State with increased support from college students. On 25 January, a full-scale riot {{broke out in}} the southern city of Madurai, sparked off by a minor altercation between agitating students and Congress party members. The riots spread all over Madras State, continued unabated for the next <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> were marked by acts of violence, arson, looting, police firing and lathi charges. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long as the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation.|$|E

5|$|Boulding {{worked in}} the family {{business}} but returned to football in March 2006, with Rotherham United. He did not play for Rotherham in <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> instead returned to Mansfield Town, along with his brother, Rory, {{at the end of}} the season. Boulding scored just six goals in his first season with Mansfield. However, after he scored 25 in his second season, when the team were relegated from The Football League, he attracted interest from a number of League One and Two clubs. He eventually decided to join Bradford City, again with his brother, but the pair were released early from their contracts after less than two years with the club. The brothers were given trials back at Mansfield Town, but while Rory joined Accrington Stanley, Michael returned to Barnsley on short-term deal and later had a similar contract at Derby County but never featured in either first team. He has also been involved with running the family's property business.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was born}} on October 14, 1859 in Petersburg, Virginia. He grew up in Central Virginia until he was {{appointed}} to the United States Naval Academy at the age of sixteen years and eight months. He began classes at the academy on June 21, 1876 and was the only member of his class from Virginia. Cabaniss was an average student while at the Naval Academy; he finished 40th in his class of 69 in his second year, earning near-top marks in drawing and mathematics but very low marks in history and French language. He also spent the mandatory <b>two</b> <b>months</b> <b>and</b> eighteen days at sea. Cabaniss had the fewest demerits of any member of his sophomore class and earned a spot on the academy's summer cruise on the USS Constellation.|$|E
