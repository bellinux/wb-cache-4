For example, controlling <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> condition in a barn could improve agricultural productivity.

5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say <b>the</b> <b>light</b> comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three months into its operation. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 {{was installed}} before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles, respectably.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As <b>the</b> <b>light</b> streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest <b>the</b> <b>light</b> source. But because her face is turned from <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards <b>the</b> <b>light</b> source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
