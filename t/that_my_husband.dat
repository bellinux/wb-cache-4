500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the statue}} was very positive. [...] The New York Times {{described it as}} producing [...] "an impression of dignity, beauty, and power." [...] But in the weeks following the dedication ceremony, praise turned to criticism and reporters noted [...] "absurdities" [...] in the relief panels. [...] They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely. [...] The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President Chester A. Arthur was called [...] "impossible" [...] and [...] "ridiculous." [...] Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881. [...] Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877. [...] Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered. [...] In a heated letter to the Evening Star, she said the reliefs were {{not meant to be}} historically accurate: [...] "Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it because we wanted these panels to portray the most prominent men {{of the history of the}} country who were in the Senate during the 16 years <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was Senator." [...] She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been [...] "absurd." ...|$|E

The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner attributed his death to a subdural hematoma, aggravated by hemophilia.

2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E

50|$|Writer Kim Soo-hyun {{strongly}} {{denied the}} accusations of plagiarism by Ryu Gyeung-ok, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>My</b> <b>Husband's</b> Woman {{was very similar}} to her own TV drama That Woman, Ok-hui.|$|R
60|$|I {{should not}} omit {{to tell you}} in this {{quantity}} of egotism <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> father and sister have received me most affectionately. She is highly accomplished, with a heart to suit the head.|$|R
2500|$|Abed Abu Jamal's widow, Nadia, {{was served}} with a {{demolition}} order on her house in East Jerusalem. her residency rights have been revoked, and she will be expelled to her family home in the West Bank. Her 3 children, Walid (6), Salma (4) and Mohammed (3), the last of which suffers from a heart condition, are permitted to stay in East Jerusalem, as their birth-place, but their rights to all social benefits, including medical coverage has been cancelled. She is protesting the measures, which she calls an example of collective punishment. She said that [...] "If we'd known <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was planning an attack, of course we would have stopped him" [...] while her in-laws said [...] {{that they could not}} come to terms with what pushed Ghassan and Uday to attack the place of worship.|$|E
2500|$|Emerson had {{convinced}} a devastated Loos {{that he needed}} to take a break from his marriage once a week. It was on these days he would date younger women, while Loos consoled herself by entertaining her friends: the Talmadge sisters, Mama Peg Talmadge, Marion Davies, Marilyn Miller, Adele Astaire and an assortment of chorus girls kept by prominent men. These [...] "Tuesday Widows" [...] soireés would influence her later writings, and it was with the [...] "Tuesday Widows" [...] that she visited one of her favorite hangouts, Harlem, where she developed a deep and lifelong appreciation for African-American culture. [...] "Sometimes I get enquiries (sic) concerning my marriage to a man who treated me with complete lack of consideration, tried to take credit for my work and appropriated all my earnings", Loos wrote in Cast of Thousands. [...] "The main reason is <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> liberated me; granted me full freedom to choose my own companions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot {{conceive}} {{a person}} {{less able to}} advise you," [...] she answered. [...] "I have said before <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> connection with your company is one which I dislike extremely, and I should be delighted to hear that it was ended." ...|$|R
5000|$|Facing war in 1812, {{the family}} moved to the farm at North Bend. There, upon hearing news of her husband's {{landslide}} electoral victory in 1840, home-loving Anna said simply: [...] "I wish <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> friends had left him where he is, happy and contented in retirement." ...|$|R
2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The jury {{were not}} quite {{satisfied}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was guilty? {{and not quite}} satisfied <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was innocent? Is that what the Scotch Verdict means?" ...|$|E

6000|$|May I beg for {{the favor}} of your {{presentation}} to Christ's [...] Hospital for my youngest son, M. N.? I have nine children, [...] and no means to educate them.

6000|$|MRS GEORGE. What! That! [She makes a half tour of {{the kitchen}} and ends right in front of him]. Young man: do you {{remember}} coming into my shop and telling me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> coals were out of place in your cellar, as Nature evidently intended them for the roof? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is not <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> mind {{is at all}} {{impaired}} by his bodily suffering, for I {{assure you}} {{that is not the}} case. But in his weakness, and in his knowledge that he is incurably ill, he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one idea. It preys upon him, embitters every moment of his painful life, and will shorten it." ...|$|R

6000|$|But Chalciope, Phrixus’ widow, went weeping to the town; for {{she remembered}} her Minuan husband, and all the pleasures of her youth, while she watched the fair faces of his kinsmen, and their long locks of golden hair.

6000|$|... "He is <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> {{associate}} in business." [...] Josephine said, [...] "and apparently desires {{to take advantage}} of <b>that</b> fact. <b>My</b> <b>husband</b> is not a reliable person where money is concerned. He seems to have been behaving rather badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} {{what you call}} reasonable," [...] she said. [...] "Find out for me who it was <b>that</b> killed <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> you or any one of you, and you shall have the letters." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} men {{succeeded in}} asserting certain technical objections to their evidence. But the terrible fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> himself had actually purchased the arsenic in both cases remained unshaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus far, {{you know}} {{little or nothing}} about me, Mr. Dexter," [...] I said. [...] "You are, as I believe, quite unaware <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and I are not living {{together}} at the present time." ...|$|E

60|$|Misfortunes seldom come alone: {{this was}} the forerunner of <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> flight; and as my {{expectations}} were cut off on <b>that</b> side, <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> gone, and <b>my</b> family of children on my hands, and nothing to subsist them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{purposely}} {{abstain from}} troubling you by any useless allusions to myself. When you have read my maid's letter, {{you will understand}} the shock which the news contained in it has caused me. I can only repeat that I place implicit belief in her statement. I am firmly persuaded <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> former housekeeper has found him out, has practiced on his weakness in my absence, and has prevailed on him to make another Will. From what I know of this woman, I feel no doubt that she has used her influence over Mr. Vanstone to deprive me, if possible, of all future interests in <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> fortune.|$|R
