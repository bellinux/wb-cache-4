5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch <b>the</b> <b>team</b> by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and <b>the</b> <b>team</b> is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves <b>the</b> <b>team</b> ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches <b>the</b> <b>team</b> before time runs out, <b>the</b> <b>team</b> leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
