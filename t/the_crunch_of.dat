2500|$|Worsening weather {{gave all}} {{signs of an}} {{approaching}} typhoon; and Vigilance was forced to anchor in various berths at Wakanoura Wan, off Honshū, between the 16th and 19th. As the storm reached its climax before dawn on the 18th, [...] dragged her anchors and drifted down toward Vigilance's berth. The minesweeper slipped her anchor and chain {{in an effort to}} avoid a collision; but the [...] wind pushed the LST inexorably toward the minecraft. Soon there came <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> steel on steel as the landing ship crashed into the minesweeper's starboard side, forward, bending in the bulwarks near the bow.|$|E
60|$|Wheeler was {{sensible}} of {{a certain}} uneasiness as he listened to <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the boring tool and the jarring thud of the hammers.|$|E
60|$|A {{sensation}} of comfort would pass through Winton, which would last quite twenty minutes after <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels and the mingled perfumes of him had died away.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} they heard <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fisherman's heavy {{boots on the}} shingle, and he looked in, with his ruddy face all shining with the salt water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let the men feed, then, and {{be ready}} for the signal to start," [...] said the chief to his officers, [...] "and see that no louder noise be heard than <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> their jaws." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face shines {{out in the}} embers; [...] I see her {{holding the}} light, And hear <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the gravel [...] And the sweep of the rain that night.|$|E
6000|$|The {{moon was}} rising. Swinging hands, they tramped toward the board-walk. <b>The</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> {{their feet in}} the sand was the rhythmic spell of a magician, which she broke when she sighed: ...|$|E
60|$|Before Bill Saltman {{could make}} reply, two running men joined the group. These were {{followed}} by several more, while <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> feet on the snow heralded the imminent arrival of many others.|$|E
60|$|She {{staggered}} {{across the}} room towards the door by which Saton had departed. Before she could reach it, however, they heard <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> wheels as his car swept by the front on its way down the avenue.|$|R
60|$|From a short {{distance}} up the trail came the unmistakable noises of the greedy feeding <b>of</b> a lion. <b>The</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> bones, <b>the</b> gulping of great pieces, the contented growling, all attested the nearness of the king at table.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a fearful}} scream of anguish and terror from the black, and mingled with {{it was the}} hideous {{challenge}} of the killing panther. Then came silence--silence except for the rending of bloody flesh and <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> human bones between mighty jaws.|$|R
60|$|Crack! {{heard the}} {{familiar}} {{music of the}} dog whip, the whining howl of the Malemutes, and <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> a sled as it drew up to the cabin. Conversation languished while they waited the issue.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Colfax, yawning, {{had taken}} a book and gone to bed. Still Virginia sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the {{lightning}} quivered across the eastern sky. She heard <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> wheels in the gravel.|$|E
6000|$|He hesitated no longer, but tapped at {{the door}} and entered. The young woman turned at <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> his boots on the sanded floor, and exclaiming, [...] "Oh, Mr. Percombe, how you frightened me!" [...] quite lost her color for a moment.|$|E

60|$|At one in {{the morning}} he walked along an unusually populous Main Street and took the turning that led up the hill to his cabin. And when he paused on the ascent, he could hear behind him <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> moccasins in the snow.|$|E
60|$|For {{the space}} of several seconds the girls stood staring at the figure outside the window. Then, the man turned sharply, and Hetty gasped as she heard <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> {{footsteps}} in the snow below. There was a little {{of it on the}} verandah, and the stars shone brilliantly.|$|E
60|$|Stooping, Porportuk crossed El-Soo’s feet, so {{that the}} instep of one lay over that of the other; and then, before his purpose could be divined, he {{discharged}} his rifle through the two ankles. As Akoon struggled to rise against {{the weight of the}} young men, there was heard <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the broken bone rebroken.|$|E
60|$|From without {{there came}} <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> gravel as <b>the</b> wagonette turned and rattled down the avenue. Kate {{listened to the}} sound of the wheels until they died away in the distance. They seemed somehow to be the last link which bound her to the human race. Her heart failed her completely, and she burst into tears.|$|R
50|$|His son, Danick Gauthier (born October 24, 1991) is a {{professional}} hockey player with <b>the</b> Syracuse <b>Crunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Hockey League.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly {{she caught}} a sound of hoofs. Was this Diana? She sped to the other window, the one that stood open, and now she heard <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> gravel and the champ of bits {{and the sound of}} more than two pairs of hoofs. She caught a glimpse of Mr. Wilding and Mr. Trenchard.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{as he sat}} there, the {{profound}} silence was suddenly broken. He heard <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the gravel beneath flying footsteps, the rustle of a skirt, a little half-subdued cry! He looked up in amazement. It was Winifred Rowan who was coming towards him, her hair disordered, her eyes lit with fear,--a strange, half-terrified figure, flying from the storm! ...|$|E
60|$|The next flare came. Bathsheba was on {{the ground}} now, {{shouldering}} another sheaf, and she bore its dazzle without flinching--thunder and all--and again ascended with the load. There was then a silence everywhere for four or five minutes, and <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the spars, as Gabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard. He thought the crisis of the storm had passed. But there came a burst of light.|$|E
50|$|According to Hogan, online data is {{becoming}} more of an asset for three reasons: First, the rise in technology is causing people to spend {{a significant amount of}} time online, second, marketing infrastructure enables <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> big data sets that yield high percentages of actual sales, and third, the rise in social media enables the collecting of personal data in large quantities.|$|R
60|$|I {{clutched}} {{hold of the}} railings. She {{came over}} to my side. Up the road I heard in <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> heavy wheels. A wagon was passing through the lodge gates. John, the woodman, was walking with unaccustomed briskness by the horses' heads, cracking his whip as he came. I looked into the girl's face by my side.|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose she}} must have seen me from the open window. It {{did not seem to}} me that I had stood there very long before I heard <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> {{footsteps}} on <b>the</b> frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in no spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near. She was all changed again, to the clocked stockings.|$|R
60|$|A {{couple of}} hours later I was awakened by <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> a boot upon my ankle, {{followed}} by an oath of surprise. The stage-driver, coming in from his last trip, was looking down upon me. I could not see his face, but I did note the bright eyes and pricking ears of a noble gray horse standing just behind his master and champing his bit with impatience.|$|E
60|$|After {{this they}} {{continued}} for some {{long time in}} a reverie, as they went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of wheat-ears at her feet.|$|E
60|$|Tansey {{rounded the}} table, and flung himself, with superb nerve, upon the Mexican. Just then a clangour began; the clocks {{of the city}} were tolling the midnight hour. Tansey {{clutched}} at Torres, and, for a moment, felt in his grasp <b>the</b> <b>crunch</b> <b>of</b> velvet and the cold facets of the glittering gems. The next instant, the bedecked caballero turned in his hands to a shrunken, leather-visaged, white-bearded, old, old, screaming mummy, sandalled, ragged, and four hundred and three. The Mexican woman was crawling to her feet, and laughing. She shook her brown hand {{in the face of}} the whining viejo.|$|E
60|$|They {{opened the}} door cautiously, {{and found that the}} wind, conquered by the rain, had abated. Miss Wilson's candle, though it flickered in the draught, was not {{extinguished}} this time; and she was presently left with the housekeeper, bolting and chaining the door, and listening to <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> feet on <b>the</b> gravel outside dying away through the steady pattering of the rain.|$|R
60|$|So {{again they}} traversed {{the path and}} this time came to the pretty garden behind the house. Ethel was tending a flower bed. She wore her gingham dress and a sunbonnet, and, {{kneeling}} in the path, stretched out her slim brown arm to uproot the weeds. But <b>the</b> <b>crunching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravel aroused her attention, and, observing her visitors, she sprang up and hastened toward them.|$|R
50|$|Rankin {{left the}} Amerks {{as a free}} agent and on July 10, 2013, was signed to a one-year {{contract}} with <b>the</b> Syracuse <b>Crunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AHL.|$|R
