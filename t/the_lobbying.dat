5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political circles, and even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871. This positioned her, along with fellow suffragette Clara Shortridge Foltz, to manage <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> campaign for the Woman Lawyer's Bill, which granted women the right to practice law in California in January 1878. Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate {{to stay in touch with}} lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, much of {{the area}} that forms today's Cleland Conservation Park was {{purchased}} by the State Government, {{in large part because}} of <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> efforts of Professor Sir John Cleland.

5|$|The court's {{decision}} was affirmed in part and reversed {{in part by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit unanimously held that the welfare-advocacy restriction was unconstitutional, but upheld other restrictions that Bronx Legal Services had challenged (such as <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> restriction) by a 2–1 vote. The Second Circuit also rejected the claim that any funding conditions would be illegitimate, instead preferring a restriction-by-restriction analysis. The national LSC asked the Supreme Court for review by petitioning for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Second Circuit was wrong in striking down the welfare-advocacy restriction.|$|E

This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E
5|$|Several factors besides <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> {{campaign}} of the United Fruit Company led the United States {{to launch the}} coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. The US government had grown more suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution as the Cold War developed and the Guatemalan government clashed with US corporations on {{an increasing number of}} issues. The US was also concerned that it had been infiltrated by communists although historian Richard H. Immerman argued that during {{the early part of the}} Cold War, the US and the CIA were predisposed to see the revolutionary government as communist, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party during his 1945–1951 presidency. Additionally, the US government was concerned that the success of Árbenz's reforms would inspire similar movements elsewhere. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence.|$|E
5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> efforts of their breed registries.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> of the United Fruit Company, several other factors also led the United States {{to launch the}} coup that toppled Árbenz in 1954. During {{the years of the}} Guatemalan Revolution, military coups occurred in several other Central American countries that brought firmly anti-communist governments to power. Army officer Major Oscar Osorio won staged elections in El Salvador in 1950, Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista took power in 1952. Honduras, where the land-holdings of the United Fruit Company were the most extensive, had been ruled by an anti-communist government sympathetic to the United States since 1932. These developments created tension between the other governments and Árbenz, which was exacerbated by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion. This support also worried the United States and the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency. According to US historian Richard Immerman, during the beginning of the Cold War, the US and the CIA tended to assume that everybody who opposed it was a communist. Thus, despite Arévalo's ban of the communist party, important figures in the US government were already predisposed to believe that the revolutionary government had been infiltrated by communists, and was a danger to the US. During the years of the revolution, several reports and memoranda were circulated amongst US government agencies that furthered this belief.|$|E
5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting the import of foreign books to also prohibit the import of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
