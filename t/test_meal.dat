50|$|The {{signaling}} pathway of the peripheral mechanism uses afferent vagal to hypothalamic centers. The central responses are mediated through a pathway including serotonergic and opioidergic components. Inveterately, enterostatin cuts fat intake, bodyweight, and body fat. This reaction may involve multiple metabolic effects of enterostatin, {{which include a}} decrease of insulin secretion, a growth in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal corticosteroid secretion. A possible pathophysiological role is indicated by studies that have associated low enterostatin output and/or responsiveness to breeds of rat that become obese and prefer dietary fat. Humans with obesity also exhibit a lower secretion from pancreatic procolipase after a <b>test</b> <b>meal,</b> compared with persons of normal weight.|$|E
50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study in vivo the over-all fatty acid specificity of the mechanisms involved in chylomicron cholesterol ester and triglyceride formation during fat absorption in the rat. Mixtures containing similar amounts of two, three, or four C14-labeled fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids), but with varying ratios of unlabeled fatty acids, were given by gastric intubation to rats with cannulated thoracic ducts. The chyle or chylomicron lipid so obtained was chromatographed on silicic acid columns to separate cholesterol esters and glycerides (the latter being 98.2% triglycerides). After assaying each lipid class for total radioactivity, gas-liquid chromatography was employed to measure the total mass {{and the distribution of}} mass and of radioactivity in the individual fatty acid components of each lipid fraction. The specific radioactivity of each fatty acid in each fraction could then be calculated. The data provided quantitative information on the relative specificity of incorporation of each fatty acid into each chylomicron lipid class and on the relative extent to which each fatty acid in each lipid fraction was diluted with endogenous fatty acid. With the exception of a slight discrimination against stearic acid, the processes of fatty acid absorption and chylomicron triglyceride formation displayed no specificity for one fatty acid relative to another. In contrast, chylomicron cholesterol ester formation showed marked specificity for oleic acid, relative to the other three fatty acids. This specificity was not significantly altered by varying the composition of the <b>test</b> <b>meal,</b> by including cholesterol in the <b>test</b> <b>meal,</b> or by feeding the animal a high-cholesterol diet for several weeks preceding the study. Considerable dilution of the dietary fatty acids with endogenous fatty acids was observed. In one experiment, 43% of the chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids was of endogenous origin. Relatively more (54%) of the cholesterol ester fatty acids was of endogenous origin.|$|E
5000|$|Wilhelm Leube {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} with gastric and {{intestinal}} disorders that included pioneer research of [...] "nervous dyspepsia".

The MSG and GMP were either added to a <b>test</b> <b>meal</b> or infused into the stomach during a <b>test</b> <b>meal.</b> Blood samples were taken to measure concentrations of glucose, insulin, epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE). Addition of 56 mg MSG to a control meal markedly reduced both phases of the meal-induced increase in plasma insulin and had no effects on blood glucose and plasma E and NE responses. Infusion of 56 mg MSG into the stomach at the onset of food intake reduced the PIR with no effect on glucose, E, NE, or the second phase insulin release. Addition of 2 mg MSG in combination with GMP to the <b>test</b> <b>meal</b> or gastric administration of these drugs did not affect the changes in any of the blood components measured. It is concluded that addition of a high dose of MSG to a <b>test</b> <b>meal</b> leads to a reduction in the vagal response to food. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Zinc {{absorption}} {{as measured}} by body retention of [65 Zn]zinc chloride or a turkey <b>test</b> <b>meal</b> extrinsically labeled with 65 Zn was determined in human subjects by whole body counting after 7 days. Average 6 tZn absorption from zinc chloride in persons with a high iron-absorbing capacity was similar to persons with a low capacity to absorb iron. Inorganic iron, 920 mol (51 mg), or HB iron, 480 imol (26 mg), inhibited 6 tZn absorption from 92 imol (6 mg) of zinc chloride. When 610 imol of iron (34 mg) was added to a turkey <b>test</b> <b>meal</b> containing 61 mol of zinc (4 mg), 6 tZn absorption was not inhibited. Tin, 306 imol (36 mg), given with zinc chloride or turkey test meals (61 mol, 4 mg, of Zn) significantly reduced 65 Zn absorption. Copper, 79 pmol (5 mg), had no {{significant effect on the}} 65 Zn absorption from 7. 9 gmol (0. 5 mg) of zinc chloride. In summary, the capacity to absorb iron did not influence 65 Zn absorption, but both inorganic iron and heme-iron inhibited 65 Zn absorption from zinc chloride. Inorganic iron had no effect, however, on 6 tZn absorption from the turkey <b>test</b> <b>meal.</b> Tin in a large dose also inhibited 65 Zn absorption from both zinc chloride and the turkey <b>test</b> <b>meal.</b> Am J C/i...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exaggerated {{postprandial}} triglyceride {{concentration is}} believed to be atherogenic, and to influence the risk of thrombosis. Both elevated plasminogen inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) and increased factor VII coagulant activity (FVIIc) are potential important contributors to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. AIM: We aimed to investigate the effect of adding four different protein types (i. e. casein, whey, cod, and gluten) to a fat-rich meal on postprandial responses of PAI- 1 and FVIIc in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients ingested four isocaloric <b>test</b> <b>meals</b> in random order. The <b>test</b> <b>meals</b> contained 100 g of butter and 45 g of carbohydrate in combination with 45 g of casein (Cas-meal), whey (Whe-meal), cod (Cod-meal), or gluten (Glu-meal), respectively. Plasma concentrations of PAI- 1 and FVIIc were measured before meal, and at regular intervals for 8 -h postprandially. RESULTS: The postprandial PAI- 1 concentration decreased significantly by 49 % to 56 % in response to the four <b>test</b> <b>meals.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} the outcomes from the four test-meals. The FVIIc levels decreased by 8 % to 11 % after the meals. Again, we observed no significant differences in outcomes between the four protein-enriched meals. CONCLUSIONS: The four proteins casein, whey, cod, and gluten, added to a fat-rich meal, all decreased the PAI- 1 and FVIIc concentrations postprandially in type 2 diabetic subjects. However, postprandial levels of PAI- 1 and FVIIc were not acutely influenced by the protein source...|$|R
40|$|Muscular {{exercise}} {{is associated with}} hypermetabolism and increased hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). In order to dissociate mechanical and metabolic factors, the effect of hypermetabolism on hypoxic ventilatory response was evaluated at rest. Carbohydrate and protein feeding increases metabolic rate, and their effects on chemosensitivity, ventilation, and blood pH were evaluated in six normal subjects 2 h and 3 h after calorically equal <b>test</b> <b>meals</b> (1, 000 cal) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Fe {{fortification}} on {{the absorption of}} Zn was studied by radioisotopic labelling of single meals, followed by measurements of whole-body retention of 65 Zn at 14 d after intake. Healthy adult volunteers participated in the study. Weaning cereal, wheat bread and infant formula, foods that are all frequently Fe-fortified, were evaluated in the study. The amounts of Fe added as FeSO 4 were similar to the levels in commercial products in Europe and the USA, and were 200 or 500 mg Fe/kg (weaning cereal), 65 mg Fe/kg (white wheat flour) and 12 mg Fe/ 1 (infant formula). For comparison, Zn absorption was measured in the same subjects, from identical <b>test</b> <b>meals</b> containing no added Fe. No statistically {{significant differences were found}} when Zn absorption from the Fe-fortified <b>test</b> <b>meals</b> was compared with that from non-Fe-fortified <b>test</b> <b>meals.</b> Fractional Zn-absorption values from Fe-fortified v. non-fortified meals were 31 · 1 (sd 1 · 19) v. 30 · 7 (SD 7 · 0) % (weaning cereal; 200 mg Fe/kg), 37 · 7 (SD 16 · 6) v. 30 · 2 (SD 9 · 9) % (weaning cereal; 500 mg Fe/kg), 36 · 5 (SD 14 · 4) v. 38 · 2 (SD 18 · 1) % (bread; 65 mg Fe/kg flour) and 41 · 6 (SD 8 · 1) v. 38 · 9 (SD 14 · 5) % (infant formula; 12 mg Fe/ 1). The addition of Fe to foods at the currently used fortification levels was thus not associated with impaired absorption of Zn and the consumption of these Fe-fortified foods would not be expected to {{have a negative effect on}} Zn nutritio...|$|R
