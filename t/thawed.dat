A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow <b>thawed</b> and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in {{economic}} terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice <b>thawed</b> and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Fifield (Sean Harris) is a {{geologist}} on the Prometheus. After waking up, he rejects friendly overtures from Millburn and casts doubt on Shaw and Holloway's mission hypothesis. Fifield accompanies the expedition to an artificial structure and deploys his spectagraphs, which {{begin to develop}} a layout for the Juggernaut. When the expedition encounters a decapitated Engineer, Fifield abandons his research and leaves the group with Millburn following. They become lost, failing to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} the expedition who has left because of the storm, and find a mound of Engineer corpses and a hidden room containing the <b>thawed,</b> mutating black liquid. They also encounter Hammerpedes: extraterrestrial, eel-like creatures which attack them. Fifield decapitates one, and its corrosive blood melts his helmet. The deformed and mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus, where he attacks the crew and murders several members before he is killed.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude <b>thawed</b> as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded in the ship. Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the <b>thawed</b> black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in his throat.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda and Uganda were allies {{during the}} First Congo War against Zaire, with both {{countries}} being {{instrumental in the}} setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war. The two nations joined forces again {{at the beginning of}} the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war. In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions, and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani. The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians. Relations slowly <b>thawed</b> in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more.|$|E

5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which <b>thawed</b> the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being <b>thawed</b> by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} <b>thawing</b> {{technique}} and the <b>thawing</b> efficiency of high voltage electrostatic <b>thawing,</b> reducing the energy consumption, {{the effects of}} technical parameters on the <b>thawing</b> rate and energy consumption were investigated. Ice contained in the Petri dish was put in the high voltage electrostatic field which {{was made up of}} a multiple point pole and a plate pole. By changing the <b>thawing</b> voltage, the electrode spacing and the distance between the two neighboring needles, the factors related to the <b>thawing</b> rate and energy consumption were quantitatively studied. The results indicate that when the distance between the needle electrodes and the surface of the plate pole is constant, the <b>thawing</b> rate increases linearly while the <b>thawing</b> energy consumption increases nonlinearly with the supplied voltage. When the supplied voltage is not changed, the ice <b>thawing</b> rate and energy consumption are changed with the distance between the two neighboring needles. When the distance between the two neighboring needles is not changed, the ice <b>thawing</b> rate and energy consumption are changed with the electrode spacing. When the electrode spacing is 9 cm, the <b>thawing</b> rate is the highest while the energy consumption is relative least, 45 kV is the optimum value for <b>thawing</b> voltage...|$|R

50|$|Nesbit had {{testified at}} both trials. It is conjectured that the <b>Thaws</b> promised her a {{comfortable}} financial future if she provided testimony at trial favorable to <b>Thaw’s</b> case. It was a conditional agreement; if the outcome proved negative, she would receive nothing. The rumored {{amount of money}} the <b>Thaws</b> pledged for her cooperation ranged from $25,000 to $1,000,000. Nesbit was now well aware that any solicitude or kindness shown her by the <b>Thaw</b> enclave was predicated on her pivotal performance on the witness stand. She was to present a pitiful portrait of innocence betrayed by the lascivious Stanford White. <b>Thaw</b> {{was to be the}} white knight whose noble, courageous act had avenged his wife’s ruin. Throughout the prolonged court proceedings, Nesbit had received financial support from the <b>Thaws.</b> These payments, made to her through the <b>Thaw</b> attorneys, had been inconsistent and far from generous. After the close of the second trial, the <b>Thaws</b> virtually abandoned Nesbit, cutting off all funds. However, in an interview Nesbit’s grandson, Russell <b>Thaw,</b> gave to The Los Angeles Times in 2005, it was his belief that Nesbit received $25,000 from the <b>Thaw</b> family {{after the end of the}} second trial.

40|$|In this study, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} to both evaluate the consumers’ general attitudes for purchasing and storing the raw chicken and determine the <b>thawing</b> practices used for defrosting frozen chicken at home. About 75 % of the consumers indicated purchasing chicken meat {{at least once a}} week or more. Furthermore, the majority (82. 16 %) of those who stored at least a portion of the raw chicken stated freezing the raw chicken meat at home. Freezing the chicken meat was considered to have no effect on the quality by 43. 49 % of the consumers while 56. 51 % thought that freezing had either negative or positive effects on the quality. The survey study indicated that top five most commonly used <b>thawing</b> practices included <b>thawing</b> on the kitchen counter, <b>thawing</b> in the refrigerator, <b>thawing</b> in the warm water, <b>thawing</b> in the microwave, and <b>thawing</b> under tap water. In addition, an experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of these most commonly used <b>thawing</b> practices on some quality characteristics of the chicken meat including pH, drip loss, cooking loss, color analysis and textural profile analysis. Although, L* value for <b>thawing</b> on the kitchen counter was the lowest, after cooking, none of the <b>thawing</b> treatments have a significant effect on the color values. <b>Thawing</b> in the microwave produced the highest drip loss of 3. 47 % while the lowest drip loss of 0. 62 % was observed with <b>thawing</b> in the refrigerator. On the other hand, <b>thawing</b> in the microwave and refrigerator caused the lowest cooking loss values of 18. 29 % and 18. 53 %, respectively. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences among textural parameter values of the defrosted and then cooked samples using the home based <b>thawing</b> practices, indicating similar quality characteristics among the samples...|$|R
