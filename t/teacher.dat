5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding <b>teacher</b> of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma <b>Teacher</b> in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding <b>teacher.</b> The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma <b>Teacher,</b> one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma <b>Teacher</b> in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma <b>Teacher</b> to become a Senior Dharma <b>Teacher</b> and this must be approved by the guiding <b>teacher.</b> At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E

5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a <b>teacher</b> was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The <b>teacher</b> reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the <b>teacher</b> and the students, the <b>teacher</b> had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the <b>teacher.</b> They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
