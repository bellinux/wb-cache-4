Despite the large number of evacuees, an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and wait out the storm. Several bridges in the area were shut down prior to Bob's arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them. The National Park Service in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>also</b> shut down campgrounds across the Outer Banks. An evacuation shelter was also opened in Carteret County.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>also</b> became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E
