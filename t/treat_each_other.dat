25|$|Given {{the same}} level playing field one {{group of people who}} <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> well will create a {{pleasant}} environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Writer Dawn Eden suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.|$|E
25|$|The story {{suggests}} {{that people have}} the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

In 2016, the actor admitted in an interview on Tonight with Boy Abunda that they already <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as boyfriend and girlfriend.

They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become {{extremely difficult to}} handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{ethnic groups}} in formal {{settings}} can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with respect, {{making it easier for}} individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else. Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E

Fidel Castro, the former First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the Cuban Revolution. Communication between the CPC and the PCC has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange. At the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, which discussed {{the possibility of the}} CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC. When Wu Guanzheng, a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: [...] "Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with sincerity.

2500|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{characterized}} Gamergate as a [...] "magnet for harassment", {{and notes}} the possible financial risk for companies {{dealing with it}} on social media platforms. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that [...] "here is {{no place in the}} video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats". ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future. At BlizzCon 2014, Blizzard Entertainment president and co-founder Mike Morhaime denounced recent harassment; blaming a [...] "small group of people [...] have been doing really awful things" [...] and [...] "tarnishing our reputation" [...] as gamers. He called on attendees to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate. CEOs of both the American and European branches of Sony Computer Entertainment, Shawn Layden and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony. The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} human-Jesus is {{a central}} piece in {{analyzing}} Pilgrim's eventual struggle with fate and free will. By establishing a Christian figure that is not initially divine in nature sets a completely different tone to the overall understanding of humanity's placement with God. In David Vanderwerken's piece [...] "Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five at Forty: Billy Pilgrim - Even More a Man of Our Time," [...] Vanderwerken states that the narrator may be calling for a [...] "humanly centered Christianity in which Jesus is a ‘nobody’ (94), a ‘bum’ (95), a man."What Vonnegut suggests here is that Christ’s divinity {{stands in the way}} of charity. If the [...] "bum" [...] is Everyman, then we are all adopted children of God; we are all Christs and should <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> accordingly. If Jesus is human, then He is imperfect and must necessarily be involved in direct or indirect evil. This Jesus participates fully in the human condition.There is some question of Christ’s divinity and how that plays a part in Christian principles and it is suggested that the voice in the novel desires a form of collectivism where humanity looks at one another as equal parts and equal heirs of God. This human-Jesus argument within the novel stands as an effort to make humanity, whom Trout may consider to be [...] "bums" [...] and [...] "nobodies," [...] have more importance.The narration's call for a more human-Jesus and Christianity is seen in {{the last part of the}} discussion on Trout’s novel where God speaks from heaven stating, [...] "From this moment on, He [...] will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has not connections!" [...] Trout’s novel attempts to make everybody somebody, as well as to emphasize the supposed cruelty of original Christian thinking, and how it ought to be changed.|$|E
