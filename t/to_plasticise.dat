The glass transition of the polymer could be identified by a step change in the heat capacity measured by TMDSC. Progesterone was found <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> the glass transition temperature at contents of 20 % w/w or less. At a 30 % loading, cold crystallisation of progesterone was seen indicating that an amorphous form of the drug was present; these microspheres were found to exhibit a pitted surface.

40|$|The present work {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the level of prepreg moisture content on the mixed-mode fracture toughness of a co-cured composite joint. It was found that moisture was stored in the prepreg as either free or bound water. It was also shown that the prepreg stores moisture from high humidity environments as free water, while the level of bound water remains unaffected. The excessive moisture was shown <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> the adhesive, lowering the glass transition temperature. The fracture toughness decreased under mode I and mode II loading as the humidity level was increased. The mixed-mode toughness also reduced with increasing storage humidity. However, the measured mixed-mode fracture toughness never reduced below that of the joints fabricated using the as-received material. This indicates that the moisture has a more pronounced effect on the bulk properties of the adhesive rather than on the interfacial adhesion between the composite and adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Most welding {{processes}} for plastics {{do not meet}} the special demands of micro technology. Laser transmission welding, however, features distinctive advantages like low mechanical and thermal load of the joining parts. Hence it is particularly suitable for the welding of micro plastics parts. Certain optical properties of the components to be welded are needed though. While one of the welding parts has to exhibit a high transmittance in the range of the laser wavelength the absorptance of the other one has to be high enough to ensure a sufficient absorption of the laser radiation <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> the material. Here, carbon black has almost exclusively gained industrial importance, since it is an inexpensive material with good absorbing properties. However, it leads to a black coloration which is not always acceptable. Recently, there are special pigmentations which allow for a non black colour in the visible range of light, but nevertheless absorb laser radiation. Up to know, only few is known about their welding characteristics, so {{that it has to be}} investigated whether they are suitable for the application in micro technology...|$|E

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} behaviour of a {{range of}} polyurethane thermoplastic elastomer montmorillonite nanocomposites has been studied using a nanohardness tester. For softer Shore hardness 80 A materials, the introduction of the organo-clay increased the creep strain obtained while the nano-indentor was held at constant load. The increase in creep strain was greatest for materials containing an organo-clay modified with a more hydrophilic quaternary alkylammonium surfactant and with higher loadings of the hydrophilic organo-clay. This suggested the effect might be due <b>to</b> a <b>plasticising</b> effect of the excess surfactant. For the harder Shore hardness 55 D materials, the addition of the organo-clays produced only a small decrease in the creep strain, probably due to the interconnected hard domains in this material...|$|R
40|$|The bonding of rigid PVC <b>to</b> a <b>plasticised</b> PVC film using a {{reactive}} {{hot melt}} polyurethane adhesive has been investigated {{in order to improve}} the stability and durability of the bonding between the PVC and the adhesive. (The primers used to modify the surface of rigid PVC are mainly solvent-based products, either methylene chloride based or methyl ethyl ketone based). With Adhesion Promoters, such concerns are environmental (High VOC emissions and clean-up costs), introductions of dirt, high maintenance costs, and safety. Chlorinated solvents, most commonly used in Adhesion Promoters, are highly flammable and toxic which in turn is dangerous to plant and personnel alike. These solvent-based products were band by European Union environment agency in 2011. Alternative surface modification technique should replace the solvent prima to modify the surface of the commercial PVC. Consequently the flame treatment technique was employed to modify the surface of the commercial PVC before bonding <b>to</b> a <b>plasticised</b> PVC film by using a {{reactive hot melt}} polyurethane adhesive. Before surface modification of the PVCs, the PVC samples were investigated by employing surface analysis’s techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements (CAM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and DMA. In order to avoid the damage of the PVC samples while they expose to X-ray irradiation. Initially, XPS and EDX were employed in a X-ray degradation study of PVC to determine the maximum time a PVC sample can be exposed to an X-ray source where X-ray has minimum effect on the surface of PVC. The samples used in the degradation study were pure PVC (drop cast in THF on to aluminium foil to produce a PVC film as reference) and three industrial PVC blends.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{function}} of receptors for molecular recognition is of vital importance {{for the construction of}} novel sensors. Initially the project has investigated the relationship between the shape of the active site of the receptor and its sensitivity and selectivity for analytes in solution. The techniques of electrochemistry, NMR and molecular modelling have been used to study materials interactions. An optimum receptor design was established for a range of analytes so that the surface of an electrode could be modified to create an analytical sensor. The specific adsorption of both the receptor and the analyte on the electrode surface were probed to produce an amperometric sensor for mandelic and lactic acids.;Subsequently, the project has involved the investigation of small molecule adsorption, recognition and permeation at polymer plant wax constituent layers that model leaf cuticles. Correlations have been sought between the responses to these surfactants/adjuvants and the wax compositions. At low levels of interaction, the quartz crystal microbalance was used as a gravimetric sensor of these processes. At higher levels of interaction, when permeation of the film is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> it, the rheological effects were used to explore solvent/small molecule permeation. In each case, qualitative data was used to diagnose film rigidity vs. viscoelasticity and quantitative data to determine film mass (thickness) or shear moduli, as appropriate. The experimental measurements have been supported by a computer model derived from the processes occurring at the interface and the resultant changes in film viscoelasatic properties are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this report is a contribution to ongoing research to develop more effective orthopaedic joint systems though fundamental studies of the behaviour of various novel material combinations and component configurations. Compliant layer technology, incorporating a low elastic modulus polyurethane layer for the bearing surface, has been proposed to offer prolonged longevity of artificial joints by maintaining a fluid film between the articulating surfaces thus reducing friction and wear. To ensure a complaint layer joint retains fit, form and function over its lifetime, material characterisation techniques were employed. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) highlighted {{the sensitivity of the}} modulus of Bionate® polyurethanes 80 A and 75 D to temperature; in particular for 75 D it revealed the close proximity of its glass transition temperature to in vivo operating temperatures and this shows a strong need for accurate temperature control during in vitro testing. The ability of aqueous lubricants <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> Bionate® materials was also demonstrated through DMTA, with reductions in the moduli and damping behaviour for hydrated samples being seen. Through a series of creep experiments, the non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of Bionate® polyurethane materials was demonstrated. Creep rupture was not observed over the test periods, and sample deformation increased considerably with increasing stress as well as temperature and lubrication. Bionate® 75 D displayed significantly lower creep strain and greater permanent deformation that 80 A. The creep data set should essentially allow development of improved designs in compliant layer technology. The tribological performance of the compliant layer articulation as a function of material combinations, implant conformity and implant size was assessed. In order to do this it was necessary to measure the frictional torque and develop tribological functional plots to determine the mode of lubrication. In this study a variety of material combinations for both hip and knee prostheses were investigated using a friction simulator. Firstly, through correlation with other published studies a friction simulator was validated using conventional ultra- high molecular weight polyethylene. Subsequently, metal-on-compliant layer hip and knee prostheses were assessed both experimentally using Stribeck analysis and theoretically using the theory of Hamrock and Dowson. Overall, the performance of compliant layer bearings was promising of improved in vivo behaviour in that fluid film lubrication and relatively low friction factors were achieved with synthetic lubricants. A strong correlation between experimental results and theoretical predictions were observed. The wear performance of a newly developed compliant layer glenoid, designed specifically to utilise compliant layer technology, in total shoulder arthroplasty was investigated. Results suggest that this type of glenoid may be more robust compared to the conventional UHMWPE glenoid. Impingement wear on the compliant layer surface was a frequent finding and was caused from repeated contact between the rim of the hemispherical humeral component and the articular surface of the glenoid, under a constant load. The addition of Vitamin E to compliant layer acetabular components was shown experimentally to have no effect on the friction characteristics of the material. MPC (2 -methacryloyloxethyl phosphorylcholine) grafting on the surface of highly crosslinked polyethylene acetabular components increased the friction and it was postulated that the phospholipids acted as boundary lubricants within a mixed lubrication regime. Larger joints are being developed to improve joint stability, propioception and functional longevity. The friction and lubrication properties of large diameter hip bearings of metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-reinforced polymer couplings were assessed. The frictional studies showed that the metal-on-metal joints worked under the mixed lubrication regime, producing similar friction factor values to each other. The ceramic-on-reinforced polymer samples were shown to operate with high friction factors and mixed lubrication. The study demonstrated that the component’s diameter had little or no influence on the lubrication and friction of the large bearing combinations tested...|$|E
40|$|Bloodmeal is an {{ancillary}} {{product of}} the agricultural industry, containing 80 – 100 % protein, and {{has been used to}} create a bio-based plastic called Novatein Thermoplastic Protein®, with a proprietary blend of sodium sulfite, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), water and triethylene glycol (TEG). Recent investigation has shown that the colour and odour of bloodmeal based thermoplastic can be significantly improved through the pre-treatment of bloodmeal with equilibrium peracetic acid. The resulting decoloured bloodmeal (DBM) no longer relies on the addition of sodium sulfite to be processed in conventional thermoplastic equipment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role by which peracetic acid decolours bloodmeal and the consequences of oxidation on composition, physico-chemical properties, protein structure and interactions and final polymer mobility. Oxidative decolouring of haem is straightforward when the haem is freely accessible or in the form of oxyhaemoglobin and most common oxidants lead to cleavage of the porphyrin ring, resulting in a loss of colour saturation. However, after extensive thermal treatment during manufacture, the haem present in bloodmeal has migrated to inaccessible hydrophobic regions of the protein aggregates or has been oxidised to the form of methaemoglobin. Literature revealed that methaemoglobin catalytically removes hydrogen peroxide, lowering decolouring efficacy. Thus, peracetic acid is required when haem is present in the form of methaemoglobin, as is found in bloodmeal. Further, it was confirmed that a minimum of 3 % w/w peracetic acid, in a 3 : 1 ratio to bloodmeal is required to obtain adequate decolouring (> 70 % whiteness based on the RGB colour space). The role of each component in equilibrium peracetic acid was established; water and acetic acid resulted in protein swelling but were found unlikely to influence accessibility of the oxidants to the haem sites and both hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid were consumed in oxidising reactions. Acidic conditions were found to reduce the consumption of hydrogen peroxide, possibly through the inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation, resulting in less effective decolouring. Acetic acid was observed to have a protective effect on protein recovery as well as the resulting iron content, molecular mass distribution and secondary structure of protein. Due to the large excess of peracetic acid solution required to facilitate diffusion and subsequent decolouring, a significant quantity remains unreacted in the recovered wastewater. Unreacted peracetic acid was shown to have potential for recycling, although in its immediate state it was insufficient to decolour fresh bloodmeal. The protein-rich decoloured bloodmeal recovered had undergone a change in secondary structure composition and was found to contain evidence of a diffusion front, consistent with the heterogeneous phase decolouring mechanism. Oxidation with peracetic acid was found to result in less β-sheet aggregation compared to hydrogen peroxide treatment, although all treatments resulted in an increase in the quantity of disordered structures. Oxidation was also found to result in a significantly lowered glass transition temperature and along with an increased enthalpy of relaxation, evidenced a large improvement in polymer chain mobility compared with untreated bloodmeal. DBM was found to be comprised of 90 – 99 % w/w protein (1 – 10 % w/w salt), with a significantly higher protein solubility and a similar volume weighted molecular mass compared with untreated bloodmeal. Further, DBM was found to have a greater composition of charged and polar amino acids, along with a large reduction in lysine and small reduction in aromatic and heterocyclic amino acids. Additionally, cystine crosslinks which stabilise bloodmeal were found to be partially oxidised to cysteine sulfonate compounds and cysteic acid (cleavage of the disulfide bond). Such a reduction in the quantity of amino acids which are capable of forming covalent networks (lysine, tyrosine and cysteine) support prior evidence that DBM no longer requires sodium sulfite to produce a thermoplastic. The influence of SDS and TEG on secondary structure and chain mobility at ambient and elevated temperatures were explored. It was found that heating DBM and DBM with SDS alone is incapable of providing sufficient energy to induce mobility and chain rearrangement. However, the addition of TEG was found to facilitate chain mobility, and beyond 55 oC significant changes to the secondary structure composition was observed, first through the formation of α-helices and finally through the aggregation of chains into β-sheets. Wide angle X-ray scattering confirmed that the changes in ordered structures composition were reversible in DBM which contained both SDS and TEG. The ability of TEG <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> DBM was more thoroughly explored, and it was found that prior to heating TEG was localised into regions either plasticiser-rich or -poor, and this resulted in the presence of two glass transition temperatures. After heating, the TEG was more homogeneously distributed, which resulted in the presence of one broad glass transition region...|$|E

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of unidirectional continuous carbon fibre composites (CFRP) containing modified epoxy resin matrices {{has been studied}} in transverse impact fracture and Mode I delamination fracture tests. It is shown that the transverse impact {{fracture toughness}} values for composites with modified matrices are generally similar to those without modifiers in the temperature range 0 -degrees-C to 80 -degrees-C. At sub-zero temperatures the composites containing rigid Al 2 O 3 powders in the matrix have much larger toughness values than the control. Potential energy release rates and stress intensity factors in Mode I delamination were measured to construct the crack growth resistance curve (R curve) by including the residual displacement effect.

40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{combining}} mammalian cells and synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications are frequently problematic. This {{is due to}} the incompatibility between the sensitive cell component and the harsh polymer processing environments required to form the desired porous scaffold e. g. high temperatures and organic solvents. This results in the necessity for an often inefficient and time consuming two step scaffold seeding process, whereby mammalian cells are added to a pre-fabricated polymer scaffold. High pressure or supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) processing is a method of fabricating porous polymer scaffolds at ambient temperatures and without using organic solvents. When pressurised, CO 2 becomes highly soluble in a variety of amorphous polymers such as poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) to produce a high viscosity liquid. Subsequent decompression causes the formation of gas bubbles that become permanent as the polymer vitrifies. Based upon technology at the University of Nottingham, we hypothesised that mammalian cells could be incorporated into poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds using a single step scCO 2 process. This would not only make the process more rapid, but it would remove the inefficient scaffold seeding step required in most cell based tissue engineering strategies. Mammalian cells were subject to a range of high pressure CO 2 and N 2 processing conditions and assessed for cell survival. It was discovered that primary hepatocytes, meniscal fibrochondrocytes, myoblastic C 2 C 12 s and 3 T 3 fibroblasts could survive after exposure to both high pressure gases on a time and pressure dependent basis. Cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute were then assessed for both gene and enzyme function. Using a microarray, it was found that only eight genes (out of 9000) in murine C 2 C 12 cells were significantly down-regulated when compared to untreated cells. Continued cell function was confirmed by measuring BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity as a measure of osteogenic differentiation in myoblastic C 2 C 12 cells. Alkaline phosphatise activity was indistinguishable between untreated cells and cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute. Additional enzyme and receptor function was confirmed by measuring cytochrome P 450 activity in primary hepatocytes after one minute of scCO 2 processing. In {{the second half of the}} study, these short processing times were found to be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>plasticise</b> and foam porous PDLLA scaffolds. Therefore, cells were incorporated into the biodegradable PDLLA foams by pre-mixing the cell suspension with the polymer powder and exposing to scCO 2. Subsequent decompression caused the polymer to foam with the cells trapped within the porous structure. Despite the presence of the plasticised PDLLA, cell survival was confirmed by both an Alamar B 1 ueTM assay and LIVE/DEADTM staining. Osteogenic differentiation on the scaffolds was confirmed by a stain and assay for BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity. Finally, a second generation processing piece of processing apparatus was designed that permitted mammalian cells to be passed into a pressurised vessel containing preplasticised PDLLA using a novel high-pressure CO 2 injection system. This was made possible by constant optimisation of the high pressure apparatus and the introduction of a cell delivery valve. When injected at high pressures cell survival was found to be reduced when compared with previous experiments although this was likely to be due to the additional mechanical trauma caused by the injection process. Despite this, the live cell population was shown to retain its osteogenic differentiation capacity when induced with BMP- 2. With further optimisation of the delivery method, cells may survive this process in sufficient numbers to suggest that it could be used as a method of seeding tissue engineering scaffolds in the future. This development could remove the limitations place on polymer processing time by the finite survival period of the cells, permitting tuning of the scaffold structure to suit the application. In summary, this study has demonstrated that mammalian cells can be incorporated into biodegradable PDLLA scaffolds using a rapid, one-step scCO 2 process without the use of toxic solvents or elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the development of the high pressure injection system could allow cells to be incorporated during the fabrication step, removing the restrictions on polymer processing. This technique could be used for the rapid production of tissue cell loaded engineering scaffolds and other associated biotechnological applications where cells and synthetic polymers are combined, such as cell therapy and recombinant protein production.

The practical operation of the theory has been confirmed for application to aggregates, powder pastes, mortars and concretes covering such properties as water demand, cohesion and per cent fines, cement content and plastic density. Derived relationships are examined including those between water demand and cement content The original concept proposed by the author in 1983 has been confirmed in principle and modified in detail {{on the basis of the}} current research and extended <b>to</b> include <b>plasticising</b> or water reducing and air entraining admixtures and the properties of air content and compressive strength together with derived relationships such as those between compressive strength and cement content.

Freeze-dried samples of separated plum skin and pulp were also analysed.

For minimising the additional effect of processing, a simple compression moulding process (which involves minimal shear) was used for preparation of starch-based films. The results show that [Emim][OAc] was favourable for plasticisation, i. e., disruption of starch granules (by scanning electron microscopy), and could result in a more amorphous structure in the starch-based materials (by X-ray diffraction and dynamic mechanical analysis). 13 C CP/MAS and SPE/MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that not only was the crystallinity reduced by [Emim][OAc], but also the amorphous starch present was <b>plasticised</b> <b>to</b> a more mobile form as indicated by the appearance of amorphous starch in the SPE/MAS spectrum. Mechanical results illustrate that, when either glycerol or [Emim][OAc] was used, a higher plasticiser content could contribute to higher flexibility. In spite of the accelerated thermal degradation of starch by [Emim][OAc] as shown by thermogravimetric analysis, the biodegradation study revealed the antimicrobial effect of [Emim][OAc] on the starch-based materials. Considering the high-amylose starch used here which is typically difficult to gelatinise in a traditional plasticiser (water and/or glycerol), [Emim][OAc] is demonstrated to be a promising plasticiser for starch to develop "green" flexible antimicrobial materials for novel applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} chewing gum for medical {{purposes}} provides discrete, convenient administration, {{the potential for}} buccal absorption and the avoidance of first pass metabolism or gastrointestinal degradation. This work contributes to the limited information available on the release of poorly soluble drugs from medicated chewing gum formulations. Lansoprazole was chosen as a model drug due to its poor solubility and instability (under acidic conditions), thus a chewing gum formulation would be of particular benefit avoiding gastrointestinal degradation. The solubility and stability of lansoprazole in artificial saliva {{was found to be}} dependent on the pH of the solution. An increase in pH caused an increase in solubility with a significant increase between pH 9 and pH 10. At pH 6, concentrations decreased over time confirming the acid instability of lansoprazole. The use of cyclodextrins as solubilisers and stabilisers for lansoprazole were investigated; complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1) resulted in a 9 fold increase in solubility compared to free lansoprazole and remained stable at pH 6. Chewing gum formulations incorporating lansoprazole were prepared and the following excipients were investigated: Revolymer‟s® hydrophilic polymer Rev 7, buffering excipients and complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1). Drug diffusion from gum surfaces was found to be limited, highlighting the need for effective mastication to ensure the timely release of the drug. In vitro release was evaluated using the EP approved masticator. Various parameters were investigated including: the type of dissolution medium, pH, chew rate and sampling and replacement volumes. Significant differences in release after 30 minutes mastication were found for gums containing Rev 7 and potassium carbonate (both of which contributed to increasing the hydrophilic capacity of the gum). These gums were also softer than other formulations due <b>to</b> a <b>plasticising</b> effect on the gum base elastomer resulting in softer, less cohesive gums. Complexation was not found {{to have an impact on}} in vitro drug release from gums. The study also assessed the buccal absorption of free lansoprazole and complexed lansoprazole (with Mβ-CD, 1 : 1) using porcine buccal mucosae. The highest partitioning coefficient was observed for free lansoprazole at pH 6. 8 due to a lower ionised fraction in combination with a lower molecular weight. Complexed lansoprazole had the highest drug flux but also had the paradoxical effect of decreasing the permeability coefficient. Overall the study contributed to increasing the understanding of factors governing the release of a poorly soluble and unstable API, lansoprazole, from a medicated chewing gum formulation.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} pressure-induced starch gelatinisation {{in water and}} milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed ‘pasting curves’, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch gelatinisation. In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules {{and the degree of}} starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced gelatinisation of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete gelatinisation after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the gelatinisation were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of gelatinisation was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e. g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of gelatinisation. Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced gelatinisation curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at = 500 MPa for 30 min at 20 °C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of gelatinisation at the levels present in 10 % total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead <b>to</b> less effective <b>plasticising</b> of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding gelatinisation by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20 °C, 30 min) or heat treated (80 °C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches {{can be explained by the}} extent of starch gelatinisation in skim milk. Starch granules absorb water during gelatinisation whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1 %. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch by showing gelatinisation properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of gelatinisation. Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced gelatinisation was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the gelatinisation properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing all-cellulose composites (ACCs) films from dissolving wood pulp by partial {{dissolution of the}} cellulose was investigated. It was thought that the undissolved fraction of the cellulose fibres would have a reinforcing effect on the final product. The ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) was used to dissolve sheets of the dissolving wood pulp on a laboratory scale. Before the cellulose sheets could be produced, the recovery of BmimCl was considered. Reuse of the solvent was important for the process to be cost effective and environmentally benign. Since little published information existed on the rinsing process to recover the solvent, a rinsing method was developed. The rinsing was performed using sequential rinsing stages with demineralised water. Increasing {{the temperature of the}} rinsing water was found to improve the efficiency of the rinsing stage and to accelerate the recovery of BmimCl. When the rinsing water was heated to 80 °C, approximately 30 % better recovery of BmimCl during the first rinsing stage was achieved compared to rinsing at 25 °C. When the BmimCl recovery for cellulose samples which were dissolved to different degrees was compared, it was found that a high degree of dissolution leads to slower recovery. Although the recovery was slower for the cellulose samples that were highly dissolved, the total recovery after four rinsing stages was 97. 6 % (+/- 2. 7 %) independent of the degree of dissolution. The concentration profiles for the duration of each rinsing stage was determined. The concentration profile of the first rinsing stage showed that more than 65 % of the BmimCl used could be recovered in 10 min when only 2. 4 ml rinsing water per gram of BmimCl was used. For the 0. 16 mm thick starting material films used in this study, four rinsing stages of 10 min duration each, using rinsing water at 80 °C was found to be sufficient for BmimCl recovery, independent of the dissolution conditions. Partial dissolution was achieved for few of the dissolution conditions investigated. Complete dissolution occurred for the majority of dissolution conditions and the produced films did not qualify as ACCs. Some of the dissolution conditions resulted not only in complete dissolution of the cellulose, but also in possible degradation and weakening of the cellulose. Especially when high concentrations of BmimCl was used, the regenerated cellulose structure had more defects and was weakened. It is recommended that shorter dissolution times and lower BmimCl concentrations be investigated. For the samples that did show some remnants of the native cellulose fibres, the undissolved fractions did not have a reinforcing effect on the regenerated cellulose matrix. For this reason, dissolving wood pulp was not suitable for the production of ACCs by partial dissolution. It is recommended that the starting material sheets be prepared as a mixture of the dissolving wood pulp and a different, stronger, high purity cellulose source, such as cotton. If the starting material contains stronger cellulose fibres, partial dissolution might result in the desired strengthening effect. Most of the sheets showed a large amount of variation which was suspected to be due to uneven dispersion and removal of the BmimCl through the film, the defects discussed or internal stresses resulting from the drying process. It is recommended that the process be refined to eliminate the large variation observed within each sample. The presence of BmimCl was found <b>to</b> have a <b>plasticising</b> effect on the produced cellulose film. The BmimCl inhibited the formation of crystals, probably resulting in the plasticising effect. It was also determined that crystals did not form as soon as cellulose precipitated from solution, due to the presence of BmimCl. Only after BmimCl was removed from the cellulose structure did crystals form in the solid cellulose structure. The crystal formation in the solid phase continued as the cellulose films were allowed to age. The long term effect of BmimCl was to reduce this crystal formation in the regenerated phase over time, but an increase in crystallinity was still observed independent of the presence of BmimCl in the cellulose. The temperature at which regeneration of the cellulose and rinsing of the regenerated material was performed visually affected the produced material. Regeneration and rinsing at 25 °C resulted in more transparent films with reduced crystallinity when compared to the films that were regenerated and rinsed at 80 °C. The films were more plastic due to the reduced crystallinity resulting from the lower temperature.
