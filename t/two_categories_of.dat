5|$|The roadways in Marquette County {{fall into}} one of three general classifications: state trunklines, county roads or city streets. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} <b>two</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> trunklines that run through the county: US highways and regular state trunklines. There have been 13 state trunkline highway designations used in Marquette County, six of which have been transferred to the jurisdiction of a city or redesignated with another number. Trunklines that are not Interstate or US highways bear a M-route designation with the diamond marker.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>two</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> Han merchants: {{those who}} sold goods at shops in urban markets, and the larger-scale {{itinerant}} traders who traveled between cities and to foreign countries. The small-scale urban shopkeepers were enrolled on an official register {{and had to}} pay heavy commercial taxes. Although these registered merchants were taxed, an edict of 94 AD ordered that landless peasants who {{had to resort to}} peddling were to be exempted from taxation.|$|E

The riders in the machines poinçonnées category {{had to use the}} same bicycle in the entire race, and to verify this, their bicycles were marked.|$|E

5|$|Hip Hop International (HHI) {{was founded}} in 2002 in the United States by Howard and Karen Schwartz. There are <b>two</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> competitions: World Battles and World Hip Hop Dance Championship. Within the World Battles category, there are four titles {{including}} three-on-three breaking champions, one-on-one popping champion, one-on-one locking champion, and one-on-one all styles (freestyle) champion. The World Hip Hop Dance Championship is for hip-hop crews. There are four divisions: junior (ages 7–12), varsity (12–18), adult (18+), and mega crew (all ages). Each crew must have at least five {{but not more than}} nine people (mega crew must have 15–40) and must perform a routine that showcases three styles of hip-hop dance. For the 2009 competition, there were 120 crews representing 30 countries. HHI also created the USA Hip Hop Dance Championship and the television show America's Best Dance Crew.|$|E

25|$|Time-independent {{perturbation}} theory {{is one of}} <b>two</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> {{perturbation theory}}, the other being time-dependent perturbation (see next section). In time-independent perturbation theory the perturbation Hamiltonian is static (i.e., possesses no time dependence). Time-independent perturbation theory was presented by Erwin Schrödinger in a 1926 paper, shortly after he produced his theories in wave mechanics. In this paper Schrödinger referred to earlier work of Lord Rayleigh, who investigated harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities. This is why this perturbation theory {{is often referred to}} as Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory.|$|E
25|$|Almost all the torrejones are {{in areas}} now {{uninhabited}} (except those in Castrejón and Alaejos, {{both of which}} were turned into castles, in later history). The torrejones were relatively simple square or egg-shaped structures, with several floors, built of limestone or brick. At least <b>two</b> <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> torrejones can be identified: The first have small peepholes in their walls and are built in regions that were in isolated areas at the time of use, and the other are small castles located in what were rural farming villages (though today they are deserted).|$|E

The animal pelts originally used were replaced by kaunakes cloth, a textile that imitated fleecy sheep skin. Kaunakes cloth {{also served as a}} symbol in religious iconography, as the fleecy cloak of St. John the Baptist.|$|E
