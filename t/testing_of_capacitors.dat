40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} combined computational and experimental study {{to understand the}} fundamental electrostatic, thermal, electromagnetic, and discharge related processes during the ageing of metallised polymer film capacitors. In the event of internal breakdowns, these <b>capacitors</b> are capable <b>of</b> 'self-healing' through a controlled isolation of defects on the electrode surfaces by mosaic patterning the electrode. The objective of this project is to develop viable computer models to unravel electrothermally activated ageing processes in capacitors. To provide the necessary validation to any capacitor models developed, our work is supported by comprehensive experiments including industrial standard accelerated life tests and associated breakdown damage analyses <b>of</b> <b>tested</b> <b>capacitors.</b> These have enabled an empirical identification of main factors affecting the reliability and lifetime <b>of</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Relevant raw data and the qualitative picture enabled by these data are crucial to the development and refinement of viable computational models <b>of</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Given the complexity of ageing processes, it is both very difficult and unnecessary to develop a one-for-all model that describes indiscriminately all relevant processes. The approach adapted in this work has been to prioritise key ageing processes and modularise each process with its own computer model. The overall picture <b>of</b> <b>capacitor</b> ageing can then be unravelled by integrating all modules together. For instance, the fine geometrical features of the electrode mosaic pattern and the capacitor's laminated structure have been assessed through a concept of field intensification using a 2 D electrostatic finite element computation. With fine geometrical features {{accounted for by the}} field intensification concept, fast electric events in capacitors can be simulated using a simple equivalent circuit model.
