5|$|After Indonesia's {{independence}} on 17 August 1945, Rijadi led Indonesian {{forces in}} the Surakarta area during <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> against the returning Dutch. Starting with a guerrilla campaign, by 1947, when he fought against Dutch offensives in Ambarawa and Semarang, {{he was in charge}} of the 26th Regiment. During a second Dutch offensive, Rijadi lost control of the city but soon retook it, later leading counter-offensives in West Java. In 1950, after the end of <b>the</b> <b>revolution,</b> Rijadi was sent to the Moluccas to put down a rebellion. After several months of planning and a month crossing Ambon Island, Rijadi was killed near the end of the operation by a rebounding bullet.|$|E

50|$|Many such {{early studies}} of {{revolutions}} tended {{to concentrate on}} four classic cases: famous and uncontroversial examples that fit virtually all definitions of <b>revolutions,</b> such as <b>the</b> Glorious <b>Revolution</b> (1688), <b>the</b> French <b>Revolution</b> (1789-1799), <b>the</b> Russian <b>Revolution</b> of 1917, and <b>the</b> Chinese <b>Revolution</b> (also known as the Chinese Civil War) (1927-1949).

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command.

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> progressed, many Tutsi left Rwanda {{to escape}} Hutu purges.

The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought reconciliation with Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of <b>the</b> <b>revolution</b> of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of <b>the</b> <b>revolution,</b> like for instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until <b>the</b> <b>Revolution,</b> many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
