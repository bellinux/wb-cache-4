By analysis of statistical data about land fluidity in the field, it is noticeable that vegetable-introducing farms purchased a large amount of land.

5000|$|The area {{first became}} a centre of {{population}} around 20,000 years ago during the Stone Age. These people were mostly nomadic until approximately 5,000 years ago. Around this time, the first farmers settled on {{and around the}} South Downs, a mile {{to the south of}} the village. They travelled from the continent, bringing with them various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> livestock.

50|$|On {{its main}} forks, the Coquille {{is also an}} {{alluvial}} river valley, meaning it was once a drowned river valley—a lake, or perhaps a much wider river, with a sandy bottom. The soil in the valley is very fertile. However, {{the rise and fall}} of the water level, and flooding in winter, prevent ordinary <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming.</b> A lush grass grows in the valley lowlands which can survive either drought or inundation. Tide-gates along the river can bring in water when needed. On this sweeping stand of grass, in summer many cattle find pasture.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine which}} factors, if any, are responsible for inter-county variation in the percent <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> operators residing off the farm in California, Iowa, Kansas, Texas, and Utah. These states were selected for this study because of their wide representation <b>of</b> the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> agricultural and sectional differences. These states vary significantly in <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm,</b> tenure conditions, off-farm employment opportunities, cultural patterns, remoteness <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> from town, and other variables. Forward step-wise regression analysis was utilized {{in each of the}} states to correlate percent <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> operators residing off the <b>farm</b> with <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm,</b> farm sales, tenancy, non-commercial farms, off-farm employment, remoteness, college education, and average off-farm income. In addition to the above variables, percent <b>of</b> Mormon <b>farm</b> operators and percent <b>of</b> non-white <b>farm</b> operators were used only in the Utah and Texas analyses respectively.

5000|$|A further {{addition}} to farming is {{the inclusion of}} irrigation, which functions differently between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> but affects fertility and thus yields. While floodplain farms can improve fertility with ditches, they are regularly improved when the Nile floods, but farms on meadows have a fixed fertility {{that can only be}} improved by building ditches around them and drawing up water from the banks of the Nile through pumps; if the pumps are placed at floodplains, the pump must have a ditch in the plain below that is connected to the water.|$|E

Beef farming involves farmers rearing cattle to approx 2 years of age to supply beef to the local meat factories. Tillage farming involves planting crops of wheat, barley and maize to be harvested and sold to local feed mills and in turn sold back to the beef and dairy farmers [...]|$|E

A USDA survey conducted in 2011 estimated that family farms account for 85 percent of US farm production and 85 percent of US gross farm income. Mid-size and larger family farms account for 60 percent of US farm production and dominate US production of cotton, cash grain and hogs. Small family farms account for 26 percent of US farm production overall, and higher percentages of production of poultry, beef cattle, some other livestock and hay.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the most {{interesting}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> for biodiversity depends on the equilibrium on agricultural markets. All other things being equal, when demand reacts to prices and when extensive farming has higher production costs, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> may allow {{a higher level of}} biodiversity than intensive farming if the relation between biodiversity and yield does not have a very high degree of convexity. This extensive farming is detrimental to consumers when their surplus is evaluated restrictively as increasing with quantities consumed and decreasing with higher prices. Its effect on agricultural producers is indeterminate. It does not have a simple effect on food security...|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> which {{exist in}} Bardera area: Irrigated farming and {{seasonal}} farming. Many medium- and small-scale farms {{near the river}} use water pumping machines. These motors irrigate the land with canals, and farmers plant crops. The majority of farmers use a low-tech farming method of farming during the two rainy seasons of gu and deyr. Small operation farms are found throughout Gedo region, {{far away from the}} river banks where families plant sorghum, maize, and beans on any land that is suitable for farming. These farming plots are located on sandy soft earth often with muddy combinations. The locals call this type of earth adable.|$|E

In nearly all areas north-east of the swamp forests have been cleared especially for charcoal production, and land clearing for farming has been extensive on the north-east, east and southern sides of the swamp. Only the western side remains relatively untouched. The development of a tourism industry in the area, which (as has been seen for the national parks) results in greater wildlife conservation efforts, depends on providing access to this part from Mumbwa or Kabwe.|$|E
