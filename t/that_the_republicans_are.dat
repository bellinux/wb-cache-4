An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters.

60|$|If Europe {{could not}} be saved without our interposition, (most {{certainly}} it could not,) I am sure {{there is not an}} Englishman who would not blush to be left out of the general effort made in favor of the general safety. But we are not secondary parties in this war; we are principals in the danger, and ought to be principals in the exertion. If any Englishman asks whether the designs of the French assassins are confined to the spot of Europe which they actually desolate, the citizen Brissot, the author of this book, {{and the author of the}} declaration of war against England, will give him his answer. He will find in this book, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>are</b> divided into factions full of the most furious and destructive animosity against each other; but he will find also that there is one point in which they perfectly agree: that they are all enemies alike to the government of all other nations, and only contend with each other about the means of propagating their tenets and extending their empire by conquest.|$|E
6000|$|The Judge tells, in proceeding, that he {{is opposed}} to making any odious distinctions between free and slave States. I am {{altogether}} unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave States. But {{there is still a}} difference, I think, between Judge Douglas and the Republicans in this. I suppose that the real difference between Judge Douglas and his friends, and the Republicans on the contrary, is, that the Judge is not in favor of making any difference between slavery and liberty; {{that he is}} in favor of eradicating, of pressing out of view, the questions of preference in this country for free or slave institutions; and consequently every sentiment he utters discards {{the idea that there is}} any wrong in slavery. Everything that emanates from him or his coadjutors in their course of policy carefully excludes the thought that there is anything wrong in slavery. All their arguments, if you will consider them, will be seen to exclude the thought that there is anything whatever wrong in slavery. If you will take the Judge's speeches, and select the short and pointed sentences expressed by him,--as his declaration that he [...] "don't care whether slavery is voted up or down,"--you will see at once that this is perfectly logical, if you do not admit that slavery is wrong. If you do admit that it is wrong, Judge Douglas cannot logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down. Judge Douglas declares that if any community wants slavery they have a right to have it. He can say that logically, if he says that there is no wrong in slavery; but if you admit that there is a wrong in it, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong. He insists that upon the score of equality the owners of slaves and owners of property--of horses and every other sort of property--should be alike, and hold them alike in a new Territory. That is perfectly logical if the two species of property are alike and are equally founded in right. But if you admit that one of them is wrong, you cannot institute any equality between right and wrong. And from this difference of sentiment,--the belief on the part of one that the institution is wrong, and a policy springing from that belief which looks to the arrest of the enlargement of that wrong, and this other sentiment, that it is no wrong, and a policy sprung from that sentiment, which will tolerate no idea of preventing the wrong from growing larger, and looks to there never being an end to it through all the existence of things,--arises the real difference between Judge Douglas and his friends on the one hand and the Republicans on the other. Now, I confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral, social, and political evil, having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown about it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong, and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> only solution, <b>Republicans</b> insisted, <b>was</b> a new {{commitment}} to free labor, and a deliberate {{effort to stop}} any more territorial expansion of slavery.

25|$|Although DOL {{had begun}} {{investigating}} Presser in 1981, DOJ's failed 1981 prosecution {{as well as}} retractions of newspaper stories led many to believe that allegations of criminal wrongdoing by Presser were unfounded.

Annot, however, received them with good news; she had heard different messages from the château during the day, and was able to tell them not only <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Marquis, Agatha, and the house <b>were</b> safe, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> soldiers <b>were</b> all prisoners, and that Santerre--that object of horror to many Vendean royalists, had himself been captured by the strong hand and bold heart of Jacques Chapeau.|$|R

However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results.

5000|$|Historians such as Wood Gray and Jennifer Weber argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Copperheads were inflexibly {{rooted in}} the past and were naive about the refusal of the Confederates to return to <b>the</b> Union.

After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, Union military success seemed assured, and Copperheadism collapsed.|$|R

2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media.

25|$|After {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most Southerners {{accepted}} the integration of most institutions (except public schools). With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed, Southerners joined the new {{middle class and the}} Northern transplants in moving toward <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues. In 1963, the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African-American voters from the Democratic primaries, which had been <b>the</b> only elections <b>that</b> mattered in most of the South. Meanwhile, the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85–90% level, a shift which further convinced many white segregationists <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> no longer <b>the</b> black party.|$|R
50|$|The United States Senate {{elections}} of 1918 were held November 5, 1918 {{coinciding with the}} midpoint of Woodrow Wilson's second term as President of the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party gained control with a slim 2-seat majority after picking up a net six seats. The change in control was particularly important, as it meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> {{in a position to}} deny entry of the United States into the League of Nations, the centerpiece of Wilson's post-war foreign policy. It was the first election in which all Class 2 senators were subject to direct election following the enactment of the Seventeenth Amendment, making them the final class under the old system.|$|R

2500|$|In October 1959, Courtney {{sponsored}} a two-day meeting in Chicago, {{which included a}} banquet to honor Robert W. Welch, Jr., {{the founder of the}} anticommunist John Birch Society. William F. Buckley, Jr., publisher of National Review magazine and a leading columnist, also attended. The meeting called {{for the establishment of a}} new party on grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> too similar in philosophy to the Democrats and would not offer conservative voters sufficient choice in general elections. The rally for a new party was promoted by columnists Tom Anderson of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, and Medford Evans, Utah Republican Governor [...] J. Bracken Lee, and investigative conservative journalist and former FBI agent Dan Smoot.|$|R
50|$|Bourbon Democrats were {{promoters}} of {{a form of}} laissez-faire capitalism which included opposition to <b>the</b> protectionism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> then advocating as well as fiscal discipline. They represented business interests, generally supporting the goals of banking and railroads but opposed to subsidies for them and were unwilling {{to protect them from}} competition. They opposed imperialism and U.S. overseas expansion, fought for the gold standard, and opposed bimetallism and promoted hard and sound money. Strong supporters of reform movements such as the Civil Service Reform and opponents of the corrupt city bosses, Bourbons led the fight against the Tweed Ring. The anti-corruption theme earned the votes of many Republican Mugwumps in 1884.|$|R
5000|$|As the 1954 congressional {{elections}} approached, {{and it became}} evident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> {{in danger of losing}} their thin majority in both houses, Eisenhower was among those blaming the Old Guard for the losses, and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing {{to take control of the}} GOP. Eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate, progressive Republican: [...] "I have just one purpose ... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it ... before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won't be with them anymore." ...|$|R
50|$|Anderson {{was elected}} as a Republican to a {{four-year}} term in the Nebraska Legislature in 1972. During his term, Anderson felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>was</b> too engaged in partisan politics, so he changed affiliation from <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> to <b>the</b> Democratic Party. At {{the end of his}} term, Anderson did not seek re-election.|$|R

[...] Fernandez stated that Hispanic voters presented a [...] "golden opportunity for the GOP," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>was</b> [...] "truly the party of the open door." [...] He was persistent in stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party could reap huge benefits by embracing the fast-growing Hispanic minority in the United States, claiming that Hispanics were [...] "natural Republicans" [...] because they had a [...] "centuries-old suspicion of oppressive central governments" [...] and [...] "learned fiscal conservatism at the knees of their mothers, who assured them that if they didn't watch their nickels they wouldn't eat." ...|$|R
60|$|Early on the {{following}} morning, the whole army was on its march towards Laval.
