5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set to go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Travers {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging {{in the back}} of the minibus, where he kept his guitar. Concerned it might be damaged, he {{approached}} the two gunmen and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be careful. Asked whether he had anything valuable inside the case, Travers replied no. The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Izzard as {{the voice}} of Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. Over 100 actors auditioned to voice the character. Izzard {{approached}} Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour (a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars): Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines. The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child, and he cherished them. When discussing Reepicheep to the animators, Adamson <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible. Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own; beforehand, the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek 2.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 1769, Boone began {{a two-year}} hunting {{expedition}} in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, a fellow hunter and he were captured by {{a party of}} Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again {{in the autumn of}} 1772.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go to the Boat Deck.|$|E

5000|$|To {{open up the}} show, a clip of Eason in the {{bathroom}} was recorded. In the clip, Eason teased the audience, welcoming <b>them</b> <b>to</b> his [...] "The Easy Ride" [...] concert, as well as made fun of Joey's funny mispronunciation of the concert name and themesong title, [...] "隆重登場". He also warned the audience about the fireworks, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> use flash photography. He also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> not <b>to</b> go to the washroom during the concert because it was [...] "rude".|$|R
60|$|He {{was going}} on like that, taking credit for a pure accident, when the second officer came up and <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> carry Bill below. He was in agony, of course, but he kept 'is {{presence}} of mind, and as they passed the cook he gave 'im such a clip {{on the side of}} the 'ead as nearly broke it.|$|R
5|$|With his angelic powers {{partially}} restored, Castiel {{sets out}} to try and stop the angelic civil war. Having killed Bartholomew in self-defence, Castiel takes command {{of most of the}} Earth-bound angels, but finds himself opposed by Metatron, who is rallying angels to his side with the intention of painting Castiel as the villain of the piece. Although Castiel learns that his stolen grace will kill him eventually, he refuses Metatron's offer to side with him, eventually convincing Gadreel to ally with him in opposing Metatron's attempt to stage a coup of Heaven even as Metatron tricks the other angels into follow him by presenting Castiel as a despot willing to destroy everything to win the war, convincing angels to 'suicide bomb' themselves and claim that Castiel <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do it. Having gained access to Heaven's 'back door' after Gadreel sacrifices himself, Castiel defeats Metatron and throws him into Heaven's prison.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1932 season, Jardine became captain of Surrey. There was much speculation that Fender had been replaced due to disputes with the Surrey committee but it was some time before this, and Jardine's appointment, was confirmed. Fender was supportive of Jardine and happy to play under him. Jardine overcame a cautious beginning to develop a more aggressive captaincy style, and Surrey finished in their highest position in the championship for six years. England played one international match that season, India's first ever Test match, and Jardine was selected as captain. India possessed a very effective bowling attack on this tour, which surprised many teams, and England's batsmen struggled against them. Jardine, who had played a long innings against the tourists for M.C.C. earlier in the season, was the only English batsman to pass 30 in both innings. He scored 79 and 85 not out, and was praised for two excellent defensive innings in a difficult situation by Wisden and The Cricketer. During the match, Jardine again clashed with his team. He gave Bill Bowes and Bill Voce the very unusual instruction to bowl one full toss each over {{to take advantage of the}} batsmen's trouble seeing the ball against the crowd. The bowlers did not do so, and were later reprimanded by Jardine who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> obey orders. Jardine himself went on to score 1,464 runs in the season at an average of 52.28.|$|E

25|$|For many Yale University {{architecture}} students, it {{was considered}} {{a rite of passage}} for decades after the house was built to sneak onto the property and see how long they could walk around until Whitney discovered them and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, a Canadian {{diplomatic}} memo surfaced, which {{alleged that}} Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee {{had met with}} Canadian consular officials in Chicago and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> disregard Obama's campaign rhetoric regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a charge the Obama campaign later denied.|$|E
25|$|Peter Jackson {{began working}} with Christian Rivers to {{storyboard}} the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.

25|$|On February 27, after a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February {{during which the}} Senators won only 7 of 21 games, Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low, taking over the coaching duties himself. Both Low and Paddock were offered other jobs within the organization. Murray said he <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> call him in a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|Those {{families}} had most {{significant impact on}} the politics of the Commonwealth. They chose the candidate for the King and they made sure that the candidate was chosen to serve their interest. The nobility voted for the candidate that Magnates and other aristocracy <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> vote on. The Magnates became the true power in the Commonwealth and the King was, with some few exceptions, only a Marionette of the Magnates in their political game.|$|E

25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> keep moving {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
25|$|Groseilliers and Radisson {{traveled}} to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They organized another expedition into Hudson Bay in 1663, {{but it was}} turned back by the ice. At Boston in 1665 they met Sir George Cartwright, who <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> travel to England to gain support. Captured by Dutch privateers on the voyage, the French men were put ashore in Spain. Reaching England, they were presented to King Charles II and became associated with Prince Rupert. Eventually Prince Rupert chartered two vessels for Radisson and Groseilliers.|$|E
25|$|At 08:00 {{the rebel}} {{officers}}' nominal superior, Maj. Kofuji, {{was told to}} inform the officers of the imperial command and order them {{to return to their}} units. However, Muranaka and Kōda had already heard of the command from Nakahashi. Believing the order to be a mistake, they went to see him. When they met Kofuji he only <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come to 1st Division Headquarters. There they met Gen. Hori, who lied to them, telling them that no command had been issued. The relieved but skeptical officers left.|$|E
