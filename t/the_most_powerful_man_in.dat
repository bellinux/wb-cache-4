5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta.

In 1521 Francis invaded the Spanish possessions in Italy and Navarre, which inaugurated {{a second round of}} Franco-Spanish conflict. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeats at Biccoca (1522), Pavia (1525, at which Francis was captured), and Landriano (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned Milan to Spain once more.|$|E

The supreme body for administering the Indies was the Council of the Indies, established in 1524.|$|E
25|$|Following Eisenhower's {{election}} and the Republican takeover of Congress, Taft served as Senate Majority Leader in 1953, and he strongly supported Eisenhower's domestic proposals. He worked hard to assist the inexperienced new officials of the administration. He even tried, with little success, to curb the excesses of red-baiting US Senator Joseph McCarthy. By April, Eisenhower and Taft were friends and golfing companions, and Taft was praising his former adversary. Defeat in 1952, it seemed, had softened Taft. No longer burdened by presidential ambitions, he had become less partisan, less abrasive, and more conciliatory; he was now widely regarded as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> Congress.|$|E

25|$|The looting of the city's {{treasury}} {{could not}} have happened {{without the help of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco, David Broderick, who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859.

As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.|$|E
25|$|The land redistribution, {{government}} reform, and colonization program strengthened and stabilized the Zhou government, {{while the}} Duke of Zhou invented the Mandate of Heaven {{in response to}} the rebellion. As a propaganda tool, the Mandate was used to legitimize the new dynasty morally and spiritually. Greatly empowered, the Zhou dynasty entered an era of prosperity and expansion that lasted until it was severely weakened by the war with Chu 961–957 BC. The triumvirate of Duke Dan of Zhou, King Cheng, and Duke Shi of Shao continued to rule the Zhou kingdom for three more years after the civil war. Eventually, however, Dan and his half-brother Shi fell out about the right form of government. Duke Dan, his own position as royal chancellor and regent in mind, opted for a meritocracy, while Duke Shi believed that the power should remain with the royal family to prevent usurpation. Possibly as result of this debate, the Duke of Zhou finally retired from court politics in 1036 BC, returning the official power to King Cheng and leaving the Duke of Shao as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the kingdom.|$|E

After suppressing Trịnh Lệ forces, Trịnh Bồng became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> north Vietnam but his leadership was bad. The entirety of north Vietnam sank into chaos, thus forcing King Lê Chiêu Thống to ask for assistance from Nguyễn Hữu Chỉnh, Tây Sơn governor of Nghệ An. Nguyen Huu Chinh led an army marched north, easily defeated Trinh army, forced Trinh Bong to flee and captured Thăng Long.
