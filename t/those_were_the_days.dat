25|$|Hay left Gainsborough {{and began}} working with Ealing in 1940, this was in an attempt for him to break up his {{partnership}} with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott who Hay had long expressed his dissatisfaction at being associated with. Claude Hulbert and Charles Hawtrey acted as Hay's sidekick in his first film for Ealing, The Ghost of St Michael's (1941). Both would return to act with Hay in respective films, Hawtrey in The Goose Steps Out (1942) and Hulbert in Hay's final film, My Learned Friend (1943). John Mills, who had appeared in Hay's first film, <b>Those</b> <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> returned to act as his sidekick in The Black Sheep of Whitehall. The Goose Steps Out (1942) for Ealing was an effective piece of anti-Nazi slapstick, in the film, Hay acts as a British spy posing as a Nazi official and teaches Nazi students about British customs. When lecturing them on this topic, he tells the students that the V sign (often used in Britain as an insult) is a mark of respect, and instructs the class to make a synchronized V sign to a portrait of Adolf Hitler. This scene is often {{considered one of the}} most iconic from a British comedy film. During Hay's tenure with Ealing he was credited as a director in three of his films, The Black Sheep of Whitehall, The Goose Steps Out and My Learned Friend. In all three, he co-directed with Basil Dearden. In 1942, he starred in a short information film, Go to Blazes alongside Thora Hird and Muriel George. The film was set during the Blitz and his role was a dim-witted father who tried unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb which had landed near his house, the bomb is only defused through the help of his daughter, portrayed by Hird. Also in 1942, he made an appearance in the propaganda film, The Big Blockade among other prolific actors of the time, including Leslie Banks, John Mills and Michael Redgrave.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} intraday {{dynamics}} of the VIX and VIX futures for the period January 2, 2008 to December 31, 2014. Considering first {{the results of a}} Vector Autoregression (VAR) using daily data, we observe that there is some evidence of causality from VIX futures to the VIX. Estimating a VAR using our ultra-high frequency data, we find strong evidence for bi-directional Granger causality between the VIX and the VIX futures. Overall, this effect appears to be stronger from VIX futures to the VIX than the other way around. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions confirm the dominance of the VIX futures. Lastly, we show that the causality from the VIX futures to <b>the</b> VIX has <b>been</b> increasing over our sample period, whereas the reverse causality has been decreasing. We observe that the VIX futures have become increasingly more important in the pricing of volatility. We further document that the VIX futures dominate the VIX more on days with negative returns, and on days with high values of the VIX, suggesting that <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when investors use VIX futures to hedge their positions rather than trading in the S&P 500 index options...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{philosophical}} tradition of arguing against presentism, {{the thesis that}} only presently existing things exist, {{on the basis of}} its incompatibility with fundamental physics. I grant that presentism is incompatible with special and general relativity, but argue that presentism is not incompatible with quantum gravity, because there are some theories of quantum gravity that utilize a fixed foliation of spacetime. I reply to various objections to this defense of presentism, and point out a flaw in Gödel’s modal argument for the ideality of time. This paper provides an interesting case study of the interplay between physics and philosophy. 2 At least, I am a presentist on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays – <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> I <b>am</b> writing this paper. 3 Nor is a point of this paper to make clear the difference between presentism and eternalism. Some philosophers (such as Callender 2000, S 588) claim not to see the difference, and there is nothing I can briefly say (beyond what I said above) to convince them otherwise. 4 For those who believe there is no such thing as “our most fundamental theory of physics”, (2) can be replaced with (2 *) There is no theory of physics more fundamental than relativity theory,...|$|R

Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts.

2500|$|Since 1913, {{the company}} had been pondering over {{starting}} a motorised bus service. The main factor against its introduction was the high accident rate for a similar service in London. Finally, after years of debate, the company came to a decision on 10 February 1926, to start a bus service later that year. Bombay saw its first bus run on 15 July 1926 between Afghan Church and Crawford Market. The people of Bombay received the bus with enthusiasm, but it took quite some time before this means of conveyance really established itself. Despite stiff opposition and protests by taxi-drivers, the service ran without a hitch, transporting 600,000 passengers {{by the end of}} that year. The following year the number had increased to 3.8 million. For several years, it was looked upon as transport for the upper middle class. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when the tram was the poor man's transport; it carried one all the way from Sassoon Dock to Dadar. The bus fare for the same journey was 25 paise. In response to the pleas made by the Government and the Bombay Municipal Corporation, the company extended its services to the northern part of the city in 1934. The Indian independence movement's call for mass non-violent strikes and general civil disobedience, led to regular service disruptions, leading to the company incurring huge losses in 1929. The next year was a particular bad year for the company in the wake of the Great Depression. To remain solvent, the company decided to introduce discounted fares for short routes, and increase its coverage to the northern portions of the city. In 1937, the introduction of double-decker buses proved to be extremely popular.|$|E

The method used in this research is event study that observe the stock price movement in the capital market. To examine the existence of price reaction, the abnormal return test will <b>be</b> conducted during <b>the</b> event period with analysis based on the concpet of CAPM (Capital Assets Pricing Model) and the abnormal return test to the increasing and decreasing dividend at the ex-dividend date. The result indicate that at the significant level of 10 %, there are two working <b>days</b> which yield <b>the</b> abnormal return that <b>is</b> significant at <b>the</b> increasing dividend. <b>Those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>day</b> before <b>the</b> event date with the value of 0. 0011102 or around 0. 1 %, and <b>the</b> fifth <b>day</b> after <b>the</b> event date with the value of - 0. 32184 or approximately 3 %.

Abstract in Bahasa Indonesia : Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis pengaruh pengumuman ex-dividend date di Bursa Efek Jakarta, dengan mengambil sampel 14 saham. Sampel dibagi menjadi dua, yaitu dividen naik dan dividen turun. Periode penelitian selama 120 hari yang dibagi menjadi dua periode yaitu periode estimasi selama 90 hari dan periode peristiwa selama 30 hari termasuk 15 hari sebelum dan sesudah event. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah event study yang akan mengamati pergerakan harga saham di pasar modal. Untuk menguji adanya reaksi harga dilakukan tes abnormal return selama periode peristiwa dengan analisis perhitungan berdasarkan konsep model-model keseimbangan yaitu Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) dan dengan melakukan pengujian abnormal return terhadap dividen naik dan dividen turun pada saat ex-dividend date. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada tingkat signifikansi 10 % ada 2 hari kerja yang masih menghasilkan abnormal return yang signifikan pada dividen naik, yaitu hari ke 4 sebelum event date sebesar - 0, 001102 atau sekitar 0, 1 % dan pada hari ke 5 setelah event date sebesar - 0, 032184 atau sekitar 3 %. Sedangkan pada dividen turun menunjukkan bahwa ada 3 hari bursa yang masih memberikan abnormal return yang signifikan, yaitu pada hari ke 13 dan pada hari ke 2 sebelum event date sebesar 0, 028263 atau sekitar 2 % dan 0, 0166274 atau sekitar 1 %, serta pada hari ke 5 setelah event date sebesar 0, 029105 atau sekitar 3 %.
