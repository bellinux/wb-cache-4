5|$|Tourists {{and locals}} visit <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> {{on the western}} side of the {{peninsula}} for views of the ocean and the sunset - hence the name, Sunset Cliffs. There are surfing spots below <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> such as Luscomb's, Garbage Beach, and New Break. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> are unstable and can be dangerous; a woman died in a fall from <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> in December 2008, and other falls have resulted in injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three capstans {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> and bollards along <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from <b>the</b> <b>cliffs,</b> and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E

5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> on {{the ocean}} side of the {{peninsula}} are sheer and are undergoing constant erosion due to wave action. On the east side the land slopes into San Diego Bay more gradually, so that homes and developments {{go right to the}} water's edge. At the northern end of the peninsula <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> and hills become lower, disappearing entirely in Ocean Beach and the Midway area, where the San Diego River flows.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to <b>the</b> <b>cliffs</b> because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

5|$|Much of Harveys Creek is in a forested gorge, {{which is}} {{situated}} in its lower reaches. The upper reaches of its watershed contain swamps and glacial lakes. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> of Tilbury Knob are also situated {{near the mouth of}} the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, which is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.|$|E
5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and gorse, shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. <b>The</b> <b>cliffs</b> are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{bombardment}} began, the German 916th Grenadiers reported their positions {{to be under}} particularly heavy fire, with the position at WN-60 very badly hit.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the factors underlying {{the popularity of}} <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb, a local burial form in the Sichuan Basin in China in the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25 - 220). The development of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb was held in {{a complex set of}} connections {{to the development of the}} burial forms, and existed through links to many other contemporary burial forms, the brick chamber tomb, the stone chamber tomb, and the princely rock-cut tomb. These connections and links formed to a large extent through the incorporation of the Sichuan area into the empire which began in the fourth century BC. It was in this context, a series of factors contributed to the formation and popularity of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tombs in Sichuan. The hilly topography and the soft sandstone, easy to cut, provided the natural condition for the development of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tombs. <b>The</b> decision to make use of this natural condition was affected by many factors rooted in the social background. The inherent nature of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb structure was fully explored, which was then followed by a series of corresponding innovations on the pictorial carvings and the burial objects. The meaning of a continuous family embedded in <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb structure was explored, as the construction of the tomb was the result of the continuous endeavours from many generations of the family, and the physical form of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb was a metaphor for a prosperous family. Following this intention of the tomb occupants underlying the design of <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb structure, <b>the</b> pictorial carvings and the burial objects in <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb made adaptations to make <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> tomb an embodiment of relations between different family members and different generations. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten <b>the</b> sandstone <b>cliffs,</b> especially on <b>the</b> Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged {{populations of the}} fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> base, invasive vines overrunning <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> face, or <b>the</b> piling of slash against <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> after logging.|$|R
50|$|This chine is {{difficult}} to identify {{as there is no}} obvious stream valley leading to <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> edge, just a slight undulation of the gently sloping agricultural land. At the bottom of the undulation look over <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> edge to see a small v-shaped gully descending rapidly to the beach below. The erosion of this chine is by underwater streams which emerge below <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> top. <b>The</b> water probably comes from a small pond about 150m from <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> edge near <b>the</b> A3055's Military Road and from the small catchment area to the west of Barnes High.|$|R
