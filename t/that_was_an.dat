5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons is an American {{animated}} television sitcom {{created by}} Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is a satirical {{depiction of a}} middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show {{is set in the}} fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society, and television, as well as many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of the Fox series The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime-time show <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> early hit for Fox.|$|E
5|$|The Utica Psychiatric Center {{is housed}} in a Greek Revival {{structure}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> insane asylum, and {{the birthplace of the}} Utica crib—a restraining device frequently used at the asylum from the mid-19thcentury to 1887. The Stanley Center for the Arts, a mid-sized concert and performance venue, was designed by Thomas W. Lamb in 1928 and today features theatrical and musical performances by local and touring groups. The Hotel Utica, designed by Esenwein & Johnson in 1912, became a nursing and residential-care facility during the 1970s. Notable guests had included Franklin D. Roosevelt, Judy Garland and Bobby Darin. It was restored as a hotel in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} the Battle of Stillman's Run in May and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound in late June was filled with war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds, and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. Two key battles, one at Horseshoe Bend on 16 June and the other at Waddams Grove on 18 June, {{played a role in}} {{changing}} public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run. The Battle of Apple River Fort on 24 June marked the end of a week <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> important turning point for the settlers. The fight was a 45-minute gun battle between defenders garrisoned inside Apple River Fort and Sauk and Fox warriors led by Chief Black Hawk.|$|E

50|$|More specifically, Boole {{agreed with}} what Aristotle said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, {{if they might}} <b>be</b> called <b>that,</b> concern what Aristotle did not say. First, {{in the realm of}} foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of Aristotle's logic to {{formulas}} in the form of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus” from “No square <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rhombus <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle” or from “No rhombus <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> square <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quadrangle”.|$|R
