40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania’s purchasing department of non- automotive products in Södertälje, Sweden during spring 2007. The management of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department of non-automotive products {{believe that their}} internal customers might not have full understanding of what <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department does. This is a problem because the internal customers might not use the contracts negotiated by <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department or they might not involve <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department when making <b>purchases.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of this thesis is to examine if and how the internal customers’ perception deviates from <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department’s perception regarding the task of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department. And also to create a communication package {{with the purpose of}} increasing the internal customers understanding of what <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department does. <b>The</b> research strategy of the thesis was a survey and empirical data was collected by using questionnaires and interviews. The communication package was designed with the result from the gap analysis, information from interviews, relevant communication theory and information from Scania’s intranet. The gap analysis indicated that the internal customers might not have complete understanding of the work which <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department does regarding the supplier base and activities concerning the supplier base, i. e. how <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department finds and evaluates suppliers. The analysis also indicated that the internal customers did not want <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department to be involved to the same extent as <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department itself wants, when finding and evaluating suppliers. The gap analysis also indicated that the internal customers possibly lack understanding of the fact that <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department has to consider the total cost imposed on Scania when evaluating quotations and choosing supplier. Furthermore the internal customers did not want <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department to be involved to the same extent as <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department itself when evaluating quotations and selecting suppliers. In order to bridge the gaps and to increase the internal customers understanding of what <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> department does, a communication package was produced. The communication package consists of a power-point presentation, instructions and a suggestion of implementation. The power- point presentation was tested in a pilot on a group of internal customers. Input for improvements was received when interviewing the internal customers participating in the pilot. The selection of internal customers in the survey questionnaire was a problem because no available information covering the whole population of internal customers was available. The method of selecting internal customers was kept in mind when analyzing the empirical data. If another selection of internal customers would have been chosen the empirical data would probably have been a little different. However the conclusions would most likely be the same because only the large gaps were considered in the analysis. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|In recent discussions it {{frequently}} occurs that <b>the</b> <b>Purchasing</b> Power Parity Theory {{is identified}} with Jevons law of one price.

40|$|Companies {{purchasing}} {{freight transport}} services may through <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process restrict or create opportunities for how transport service providers deliver the transport service. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore how the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services can influence the reduction of CO 2 emissions. This thesis is a compilation of three papers based on empirical data, collected mainly through interviews in three multiple-case studies. The results include descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services. Influence of <b>the</b> contextual dimensions <b>purchase</b> task, importance, and service type on <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport is discussed, and eight different types of contexts and their implications for the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process are presented. Relationships between <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport and logistical variables, related to CO 2 emissions, are identified. In particular, time requirements and information sharing are highlighted as important underlying aspects of the relationships. Different configurations of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process for freight transport services facilitate or hinder consideration of such aspects. The results lead to increased understanding of how contextual variables influence the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> process. <b>The</b> results also contribute to theory on reducing negative effects of freight transport on the environment, by connecting practices to logistical variables {{that are related to}} CO 2 emissions, combining a purchasing process model with an existing framework that depicts the relationship between logistics and environmental effects. The results can be used by companies purchasing freight transport to support discussions aiming to reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R
