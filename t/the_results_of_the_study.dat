5|$|The {{first major}} change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.|$|E

25|$|The general {{effectiveness}} of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly {{explained by the}} theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that {{the mental health of}} the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.|$|E
25|$|One study {{demonstrated}} that cross-modal visual and auditory integration is present from within 1 year of life. This study measured response time for orientating towards a source.

Younger infants, however, showed no such change in response times to these different conditions. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> indicates that children potentially {{have the capacity to}} integrate sensory sources at any age.

25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees.

Because of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|Positive {{emotions}} {{not only}} have physical outcomes but also physiological ones. Some physiological outcomes caused by humor include improvements in immune system functioning and increases in levels of salivary immunoglobulin A, a vital system antibody, which serves as the body’s {{first line of defense}} in respiratory illnesses. Moreover, other health outcomes include faster injury recovery rate and lower readmission rates to hospitals for the elderly, and reductions in a patient’s stay in the hospital, among many other benefits. A study was done on positive emotions in trait-resilient individuals and the cardiovascular recovery rate following negative emotions felt by those individuals. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> showed that trait-resilient individuals experiencing positive emotions had an acceleration in the speed in rebounding from cardiovascular activation initially generated by negative emotional arousal, i.e. heart rate and the like.|$|E

25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services.

Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, {{and some of them are}} having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services.

25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} the patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy program should be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E

A 2013 study, based on a much larger sample base, drew differing conclusions, namely, that the Mt-DNA of Ashkenazi Jews originated among southern European women, where Diaspora communities had been established centuries before {{the fall of the}} Second Temple in 70 CE.

However, the authors of the 2014 study also state that definitively answering the question of whether this group was of Jewish origin rather than the result of a Neolithic migration to Europe would require the genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations.|$|E
