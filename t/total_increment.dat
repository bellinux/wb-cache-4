In particular, the phase evolution across a sequence of Coulomb Blockade (CB) peaks is demonstrated to have a peculiar structure, characterized by an increase of pi across each peak, followed by an abrupt phase lapse of pi in each CB valley. A simple theory accounting for the origin of such phase lapses {{as well as for}} their small scale is discussed, though a satisfactory explanation of the presence of a phase lapse in each CB valley is still lacking. As the temperature of the system is reduced, the Kondo effect develops in CB valleys with non-zero QD spin (Kondo valleys).

During {{the first half of}} the arginine infusion (500 mg/kg over 30 min) the glucagon rise in controls and diabetics was similar (P greater than 0. 1), whereas during the last half of the infusion excessive glucagon levels were seen in the diabetics.

The acute phase responses of insulin to intravenous, maximal stimulating doses of glucose (20 g) and arginine (2. 5 g) were measured in five insulin-independent diabetics. Although the acute insulin response to arginine was normal, there was marked attentuation of the early beta-cell response upon stimulation by glucose. From these results we conclude that although in diabetes excessive glucagon levels are observed with chronic arginine stimulation, the acute phase of glucagon secretion in response to arginine is normal.

The influence of fertilization and different feeding of fish was researched through these parameters: yield and increment of fish, individual weight, losses, food conversion, Fultons and Clark’s coefficient of carp. The hydrochemical conditions in individual pounds where researched too (tabl 2). The <b>total</b> <b>increment</b> of fish was 703 ind × ha- 1 (I variant, without fertilization, feeding of carp with cereals), 1302 ind × ha- 1 (variant II, fertilization, 500 kg × ha- 1 NPK 17 : 8 : 9, feeding with cereals) and 2537 kg × ha- 1 (variant III, without fertilization, feeding carp with pellets containing 20 % protein of animal origin). The increment of carps was 611. 4; 897. 8 and 1923. 5 kg × ha- 1 resp. The results of production are shown on tables 3, 4 and 5.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{analyses}} of the activity of cambium {{and the study of}} the increment of wood during one growing season of pe-dunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) under conditions of a floodplain forest is provided. The following parameters were studied: {{the beginning and end of}} the cambial activity, differentiation of wood fibres (libriform) and vessels and analysis of the <b>total</b> <b>increment</b> of wood during vegetation in dominant (D), co-dominant (CD) and subdominant (SD) trees in relation to ecological factors of the environment. The course of wood formation corresponds to typical growth curves which are modified by factors of the environment (mean daily temperature, precipitation, soil water supply). The rate of growth is limited by factors of the environment and under the lack of some of them it is reduced resulting in the decrease in the total production of cells. Oak is a species sensitively responding to the period of drought which is particularly manifested in wood increment in subdominant trees. Sufficient supplies of water during spring months accelerate the formation of early wood including differentiation of spring vessels as corroborated by the results. The total formation of wood is dependent not only on the characteristics of the respective growing season but particularly on the social position of trees in the stand...|$|E

Both the increment in total carbohydrate oxidation (P <. 05) and the increment in exogenous carbohydrate oxidation (P <. 01) were significantly higher with fructose and sucrose compared with glucose and starch. The initial inhibition of lipid oxidation was higher with sucrose and fructose than with glucose and starch, whereas the integrated decrement in lipid oxidation over 6 hours was only higher with fructose compared with glucose and starch (P <. 05).

Herein, {{we use the}} input-output (I-O) structural decomposition {{method to}} examine the changes in CO 2 emission over a 15 -year period. By decomposing the CO 2 emission changes into nine factors for the periods of 1989 - 1994, 1994 - 1999, and 1999 - 2004, we have identified the key factors causing the emission changes, {{as well as the}} most important trends regarding the industrial development process in Taiwan. The 5 -year increment with the largest increase of CO 2 emission was that of 1999 - 2004, due to the rapid increase of electricity consumption. From the decomposition, the industrial energy coefficient and the CO 2 emission factors were identified as the most important parameters for the determination of the highway, petrochemical materials, iron and steel, the commercial sector, and electric machinery as the major sources of increased CO 2 emission during the past 15 years. From 1989 to 2004, the level of exports and the level of domestic final demand were the largest contributors to the increase in the <b>total</b> <b>increment</b> of CO 2 change. During 1989 - 2004, the industrial energy coefficient and CO 2 emission factors, being minimally significant during 1989 - 1994, became extremely important, joining the domestic final demand and the level of exports factors as the major causes of the increase increment of CO 2. This indicates a heavy reliance upon high-energy (and CO 2) intensity for Taiwanese industries; therefore, continuous efforts to improve energy intensity and fuel mix toward lower carbon are important for CO 2 reduction, especially for the electricity and power generation sectors.

Recently, low <b>total</b> cortisol <b>increments</b> after tetracosactrin {{have been associated}} with increased mortality and hemodynamic responsiveness to exogenous hydrocortisone in septic shock (SS), a phenomenon termed by some investigators as relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI). Hypothesis: Free plasma cortisol may correspond more closely to illness severity than total cortisol, comparing SS and sepsis (S). Design: This was a prospective study. Setting: This study took place in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients: Patients had SS (n = 45) or S (n = 19) or were healthy controls (HCs; n = 10). Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} compare total with free cortisol, measured directly and estimated by Coolens’ method, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and albumin in patients with SS (with and without RAI) and S during acute illness, recovery, and convalescence. Results: Comparing SS, S, and HC subjects, free cortisol levels reflected illness severity more closely than total cortisol (basal free cortisol, SS, 186 vs. S, 29 vs. HC, 13 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001 compared with basal total cortisol, SS, 880 vs. S, 417 vs. HC, 352 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001). Stimulated free cortisol increments varied greatly with illness category (SS, 192 vs. S, 115 vs. HC, 59 nmol/liter, P = 0. 004), whereas <b>total</b> cortisol <b>increments</b> did not (SS, 474 vs. S, 576 vs. HC, 524 nmol/liter, P = 0. 013). The lack of increase in total cortisol with illness severity is due to lower CBG and albumin. One third of patients with SS (15 of 45) but no S patients met a recently described criterion for RAI (<b>total</b> cortisol <b>increment</b> after tetracosactrin ≤ 248 nmol/liter). RAI patients had higher basal total cortisol (1157 vs. 756 nmol/liter; P = 0. 028) and basal free cortisol (287 vs. 140 nmol/liter; P = 0. 017) than non-RAI patients. Mean cortisol increments in RAI were lower (total, 99 vs. 648 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001; free, 59 vs. 252 nmol/liter, P < 0. 001). These differences were not due to altered CBG or albumin levels. Free cortisol levels normalized more promptly than total cortisol in convalescence. Calculated free cortisol by Coolens’ method compared closely with measured free cortisol. Conclusions: Free cortisol is likely to be a better guide to cortisolemia in systemic infection because it corresponds more closely to illness severity. The attenuated cortisol increment after tetracosactrin in RAI is not due to low cortisol-binding proteins. Free cortisol levels can be determined reliably using total cortisol and CBG levels. J. T.

40|$|Results {{of eight}} {{thinning}} experiments in trembling aspen (Pap 1 l 11 l. s tl'cmu laides Michx.) have been pooled, chiefly {{for the purpose}} of developing tentative thinning regimes for the eastern plains area of Canada. Thinning regimes to age 40 were developed, and they indicate that total volume production can be increased by as much as 25 per cent by thinning at 5 -year intervals. Under a heavy thinning schedule, crop trees at age 40 can be expected to average 8. 0 inches in diameter at breast height as compared to 6. 0 inches in unthinned stands. Maximum net periodic <b>total</b> volume <b>increments</b> for 10 -, 20 -, 30 -, 40 -, and 50 -year-old stands were achieved at about 30, 50, 65, 85 and 100 square feet basal area per acre respectively...|$|R
