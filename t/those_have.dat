5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; <b>those</b> <b>have</b> occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of <b>those</b> <b>have</b> a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90.

25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): {{that faith}} alone, apart from any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely {{evidence of that}} faith. Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined for heaven, while <b>those</b> <b>have</b> not been saved will be excluded from heaven.

25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the impact on}} landowners who lost the right to build on their property due to the view shed restrictions, the county adopted an unusual transfer of development rights ordinance. It allows {{the owner of a}} property that cannot be developed to transfer that right to another piece of land where building is permitted. To take advantage of the transfer, the owner must dedicate a permanent, irrevocable scenic easement to the county that prohibits residential and commercial use of the property. To encourage adoption of the land use policy, the county offered landowners a two-for-one transfer ratio. Planners recognize that a view of the ocean is worth twice an inland view. For each buildable parcel given up by an owner, they receive the right to transfer their credit to two locations, as long as the usage meets the land use policy restrictions such as density. , eight impacted parcels have been leveraged into 16 transfer rights, and nine of <b>those</b> <b>have</b> been used since the program was implemented in 1988.|$|E
