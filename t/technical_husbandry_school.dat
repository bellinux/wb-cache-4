Dogs are considered {{a risk factor for}} human Chagas disease, a sentinel for T. cruzi infection in endemic regions and an animal model to study pathological aspects of the disease. The potential use of dogs as indicators of human cardiac pathogenicity of local T. cruzi strains has been studied insufficiently. We studied electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic (ECG) alteration frequencies observed in an open population of dogs in Malinalco, Mexico, and determined if such frequencies were statistically associated with T. cruzi infection in dogs. Animals (n = 139) were clinically examined and owners were asked to answer a questionnaire about dogs&rsquo; living conditions. Two commercial serological tests (IHA, ELISA) were conducted to detect anti-T. cruzi serum antibodies. Significant differences between seropositive and seronegative animals in cardiomyopathic frequencies were detected through EKG and ECG (P &lt; 0. 05). Thirty dogs (21. 58 %) were serologically positive to anti-T. cruzi antibodies (to ELISA and IHA assays), of which nine (30 %) had EKG and/or ECG alterations. From the remaining 104 (78. 42 %) seronegative animals, five (4. 5 %) had EKG and/or ECG abnormalities. Our data support the hypothesis that most EKG and ECG alterations found in dogs from Malinalco could be associated with T. cruzi infection. Considering the dog as a sentinel and as an animal model for Chagas disease in humans, our findings suggest that the T. cruzi strains circulating in Malinalco have the potential to produce cardiomyopathies in infected humans.

40|$|Title of the paper: Evaluating {{welfare in}} {{practical}} farm animal husbandry – discussion of criteria selection using {{the example of}} fattening pig husbandry In the evaluation of animal welfare under practical husbandry conditions – beside a clear definition of welfare – selection of indicators plays an important role. Using the example of fattening pig husbandry, the usefulness of physiological, immunological and pathological, ethological, and <b>technical</b> criteria of <b>husbandry</b> conditions is discussed. While physiological and immunological parameters can lead to findings about stress reactions under controlled circumstances their direct transfer to practical conditions is hardly possible. On the contrary, ethological indicators as outer signs of inner states can be recorded most reliable. Beside stereotypies and aberrant behaviour as clear signs of reduced welfare, especially in barren environments, the performance of species-specific behaviour can point to {{a positive influence on}} welfare. Behavioural observations {{over a longer period of}} time considering plenty of (ethological) indicators build a solid base for selection of methods. For further interpretation of results behavioural data should be supplemented by parameters which can be recorded without major distraction of the animals: general condition of the animal including injuries and soiling, performance, technical data of the husbandry conditions as well as the increasingly important evaluation of carcasses...|$|R
40|$|Papua {{presents}} Indonesia with an intractable development challenge; {{while the}} province {{is the source}} of great national wealth from its extractive industries, 41 % of population remains below the poverty line. Accordingly, the Papuan provincial government, with help from international donors, is enhancing community development through promoting a sustainable livelihoods strategy based on agriculture. During 2001 - 2006, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research funded a research project to improve the sweetpotato-pig systems of the Dani people in the Baliem Valley. This study evaluates the impact of this project on Dani livelihoods, and examines the value of the Sustainable Livelihood (SL) framework {{for the purpose of this}} evaluation. Surveys with semi-structured group interviews and other Participatory Rural Appraisal techniques collected primary bio-physical and socio-economic data, both quantitatively and qualitatively. ‘Before-'and ‘After-project’ information was collected from project participants (n = 38) and a comparison group (n = 190). The survey sample was determined using the propensity score matching method. A double difference statistical method was used to quantify the impact of the project in terms of relative changes in livelihood assets between project and comparison groups. A similar method was used to establish qualitative differences in vulnerability factors associated with sweetpotato and pig production. Silis – the fundamental social unit of the Dani community – was used as a unit of analysis. Impacts of the research project on the 5 categories of Livelihood Assets include: 1) improved sweetpotato genetic diversity, higher yields, crop production efficiency and cycles and resilience against environmental stress, and less dependence on natural resource products for income (natural assets); 2) improvements in physical sili goods and the adoption of the pigsty-laleken technology (physical assets); 3) improvements in education and sweetpotato-pig husbandry skills (human assets); 4) improvements in social cohesion through the formation of sili organisations (social assets); 5) and improvements in the capacity of producing more sweetpotatoes and pigs, and cash incomes (financial assets). Moreover, the vulnerability factors of sweetpotato and pig production such as sweetpotato yields and pig diseases is reduced by sili participation in the project. Drawing on these impacts the study proposes a number of recommendations in the context of the “policies, institutions, and processes” component of the SL framework. The proposed policies include extension of the improved sweetpotato-pig systems through farmer-to-farmer extension programmes, efficient sweetpotato-pig <b>husbandry</b> <b>technical</b> assistance from local institutions, the formation of sili organisations in every village, equitable agricultural training opportunity for both Dani men and women, wider access to loans from local financial institutions, on-farm multiplication of new sweetpotato cultivar cuttings, and regulations to control marauding pigs. Meanwhile, the institutions that need closer facilitated collaboration are the Jayawijaya Extension, Agricultural, Livestock, and Co-operative Offices (government organisations); and the World Vision Indonesia and the Jayawijaya Institute for Customary Discussion (non-government organisations). Furthermore, wider participation of silis, and the provision and continuation of training for local technical staff within the institutions should be encouraged. The use of the SL framework elsewhere has been either as an analytical tool, as a tool impact assessment, or an overview to guide development. In this study, all these values of the SL framework are used to evaluate the impact of the project. As such it offers a more comprehensive impact evaluation with more quantification of impacts than other similar studies. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} Originally the {{intention}} of the investigation was simple: to find out what important pertinent differences could be distinguished between successful and unsuccessful settlers in a land-settlement area. For various reasons the Santa Cruz project near the city of Rio de Janeiro was chosen as site for the study. One part of this project (the Santa Cruz section) had been settled in the 1930 's, the other part (the section Piranema) in the 1940 's. All farm-operators had begun on an equal footing, with a farm of 10 hectares. What differences had come into existence since? Given the small size of their farms, the success of the farm-operators seemed to depend on {{the degree to which they}} had adopted technical innovations; indeed, in the beginning I intended to regard their adoption score as an indication of their sucees. It was the literature on diffusion and adoption of innovations that suggested which differences between high and low adopters might be most meaningful. During the first reconnaissance, however, I found that the adoption of innovations might not be the only relevant, or even the most relevant, aspect of behaviour that determined agricultural development in the project. Traditional values and attitudes seemed to be at least as important as adoption. Unfortunately, the planned survey by questionnaire had to be carried out at an early stage and the schedule could, for that reason, contain only a limited number of questions on these values and attitudes. But much information on traditional culture could be gathered by anthropological methods after the survey had been completed. During this second stage of the investigation attention was focused on traditional values and dispositions relating to cooperation and agricultural production which were still adhered to in the project and which seemed to be inimical to its development as a system of family farms. Implicitly I have assumed that a project like that of Santa Cruz, consisting of small family farms, did not represent a form of agricultural organization that is, in Brazil, under all circumstances incompatible with development. It may be that there are other organizational forms which, considering the ethos of the rural populace, are better suited to further development. But it can hardly be suggested that the family farm is an economic impossibility. Once I had observed that there existed other obstacles to development than the use of traditional agricultural techniques, I had to stop using the terms 'modern' and 'traditional' which I had until then employed to distinguish between the high and the low adopters. There was no telling, beforehand, whether the adoption of technical innovations by a Santa Cruz farmer would go together with a value and attitude change in other respects. The concepts 'modern' and 'traditional' implied much more than merely the adoption or rejection of innovations 'iheir contents, so far as they could be gleaned from the (non-Brazilian) literature, mostly seemed inapplicable to the situation in the project. Yet the terms did not imply those value and attitude changes that, in the project, seemed to be indispensible for further agricultural development. The results The results of the study are presented in chapters 4 to 7. Chapter 4 contains a description, based on quantitative material, of the important aspects of agriculture in the project such as crops, animal <b>husbandry,</b> <b>technical</b> level, land tenure, marketing and professional and informal relationships of the farm-operators. The settlers had a marked preference for cash crops over crops grown for home consumption, and were not averse to changing the cropping pattern, replacing one crop by another, if the price was more remunerative. Having cattle was associated with farm size, the dependent variable being farm size. Independence of middlemen was valued enough to have caused the purchase of a sizable number of trucks. Some innovations were adopted selectively, that is, used for one crop but not for another. The criterion appeared to be the importance of the crop as a source of cash income, and hence also the magnitude of the financial loss that the non-adoption of the innovation could entail. Innovations were also discontinued: used for some time and then dropped. Chapter 5 deals with some differences between high and low adopters of agricultural innovations. Practice adoption was found to be positively and significantly associated with the following variables: socio-economic status, income, area owned, education, literacy, former urban residence, urban visiting, contact with extension officers and with other personal sources of extension and advice, membership of cooperatives, and education of older children. The use of partial associations, controlling for status, suggested that education, literacy, former urban residence and urban visiting were partly consequences of high status and only significantly associated with practice adoption in the highest (or higher) status categories. Owing to the difficulty involved in 'dating' socio-economic status as compared with education, former urban residence and urban visiting, the associations between practice adoption and these variables may be spurious. Yet the consistency with which practice adoption was associated with these variables only in the highest status categories, seems to warrant the conclusion that education and familiarity with urban ways of life and ideas do only foster practice adoption if the farmer has the means to adopt an innovation, the insight necessary to assess its usefulness and the wish to remain on his farm. Practice adoption was differently associated in the two sections of the project with having professional relations. In Santa Cruz, by far the oldest of the two sections, practice adoption was associated with visiting a farm, with asking for advice when the farmer met with a difficulty on his farm, and with having been asked for advice. In Piranema, the section which was settled much later, only the last association existed. In neither section was practice adoption associated with having non-professional relationships. In Piranema the number of choices per chooser, for professional and for non-professional relationships, tended to be higher the higher the adoptionscore quartile. In Santa Cruz, the specificity of professional relationships, i. e. the degree to which a respondent reported having only one sort of relationship with another person, was strongly and significantly associated with practice adoption. The innovative farm- operators in that section seemed to choose, much more than in Piranema, with whom they would have a certain relationship. In line with this, in Santa Cruz the percentage of choices falling on neighbours decreased when the adoption score of the chooser increased. Remarkably, practice adoption proved not to be associated with the education of children of school age. The employment of sharecroppers likewise was not associated with practice adoption, but the employment of wage-earners was. The last section of chapter 5 showed that the Japanese farm-operators not only differed significantly in adoption score from their Brazilian colleagues, but also in how they operated their farm. Chapter 6 opens with a description of a cluster of traditional rural values and attitudes which I have called the patronic syndrome. This syndrome consists of three elements: the belief that one's own efforts to improve one's condition will be ineffective unless assisted by superior (or supernatural) powers; the disposition to seek to establish patronage relations with people with whom one is not related by kinship or friendship; and the absence of feelings of solidarity towards people with whom one is not related by kinship, friendship or patronage. The existence of this syndrome in traditional rural Brazil is possibly a result of historical circumstances. I have tried to indicate its functions. In the project, however, it is its dysfunction that appears to carry most weight: the fact that it hampers the establishment of cooperative action. An analysis of some case histories and incidents related with cooperation leads to the conclusion that the patronic syndrome is still operative in the project of Santa Cruz and that it is dysfunctional in the sense described above. Some suggestions are given as to how the syndrome can be not so much overcome as used: the institutionalization of patronage is recommended. In practice this means that the government agency which administers a particular project should be accorded the role of patron. Chapter 7 deals with how traditional values and attitudes towards agricultural production (land use and resource allocation) still influence matters in the project of Santa Cruz. Like the preceding chapter, it starts with a description of this value pattern (which I have called the 'Grand Tradition' of agriculture), such as it has been found to exist in the past in Brazil. The pattern is shown to have been intimately associated with certain historical developments in Brazilian agriculture, and its functional aspects are stressed. The few relevant quantitative data which were available and the qualitative information from interviews and observation were used to assess how much the 'Grand Tradition' is still adhered to in the project. Somewhat surprisingly, rather consistent indications were found that the high adopters among our respondents are freer than others from at least some of the values and attitudes involved. This was true of the attitude to land as a substitute for capital investment (not of the attitude to land as a good thing on its own) and of the attitude towards the allocation of capital. The high adopters seem to realize, or are coming to realize, the necessity of using capital if agriculture is to become more remunerative. In the choice of crops and the partaking in farm work they probably hold the same values as the low adopters. The|$|R
