40|$|Background: Seasonal {{reference}} ranges for {{adrenocorticotropic hormone}} (ACTH) levels for diagnosing PPID have been determined in the UK (47 pg/mL in autumn and 29 pg/mL in other seasons) {{and are in}} use in the Netherlands, although {{they have yet to}} be confirmed. The <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> is a relatively new and potentially more sensitive diagnostic test for PPID in horses than previous tests but evaluation of the test is limited. Reference values for the <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> were established in a small group of horses for winter, spring and summer in the USA. Hypotheses/goal: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate seasonal changes in basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and in ACTH levels in response to Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) administration in horses with clinical signs of PPID and aged horses without signs of PPID in the Netherlands. We expected the seasonal reference ranges for ACTH determined in the UK to be discriminating for diagnosing PPID in the horse in the Netherlands. The <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> is expected to be suitable for confirming PPID in the horse in winter, spring and summer. Materials and methods: Forty-two horses and 13 ponies participated in this study. The animals were allocated to the PPID (n= 15) or control group (n= 40) based on their clinical symptoms (i. e. hypertrichosis). Seven horses and 8 ponies were allocated to the PPID group. The <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> was carried out in 7 horses and 7 ponies in the PPID group, for 1 pony in the PPID group only the basal plasma ACTH concentration was measured. Thirty-five horses and 5 ponies were allocated to the control group. The <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> was carried out in 19 horses and 4 ponies in the control group, for 16 horses and 1 pony in the control group only the basal plasma ACTH concentration was measured.

40|$|Complete {{selective}} pituitary adenomectomy for acromegaly {{may fail}} to cure the underlying endocrinopathy. A 40 -year-old man who had acromegaly of ten-years duration was initially treated with pituitary irradiation eight years prior to surgery. Three years after irradiation his mean GH concentration decreased from 53 to 9. 0 ng/ml, then subsequently increased, and was associated with development of severe hyperglycemia. A transsphenoidal microdissection was performed, and a discrete pituitary adenoma was visualized and totally removed at surgery. GH concentrations decreased from 46 to 5. 0 ng/ml one week after surgery and to 3. 0 ng/ml 10 months after surgery. Despite improvement postoperatively, the patient still demonstrated abnormal GH dynamics and responses to the GTT, abnormal nocturnal and random GH sampling, and abnormal responses to the L-dopa, apomorphine, and <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>tests.</b> Acromegaly could be caused by either hypothalamic hyperfunction, an autonomous pituitary tumor, or both; but the latter would not explain the results obtained in this patient.

However, Sheehan's Syndrome often emerges insidiously and may not fully develop for several years [2]. Patients with long-standing Sheehan's Syndrome are exposed to considerable risk especially during times of stress [3]. Since the onset of clinically apparent disease may be delayed for several years, there may be a number of apparently normal women who have experienced postpartum blood loss and who may have impaired pituitary function.

Design: To assess various parameters related to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and peripheral tissue responses to L- T- 3 in 22 normal individuals (median age: 30. 5 years). Subjects were submitted to an intravenous TRH test at baseline condition and also to the oral administration of sequential and graded doses of L- T- 3 (50, 100, and 200 mu g/day), each given over 3 days, at an outpatient clinic. Blood samples were obtained for thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) at basal and then 15, 30, and 60 minutes after the TRH injection. Effects of L- T 3 administration on cholesterol, creatine kinase, retinol, ferritin, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were also measured at basal and after the oral administration of L- T- 3. Main outcome: TRH administration resulted in an increase of 4 -to 14 -fold rise in serum TSH (8. 3 +/- 2. 5 -fold), and in a slight rise in serum PRL concentrations (3. 8 +/- 1. 5 -fold). Administration of graded doses of triiodothyronine (T- 3) resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of TSH and PRL. Basal thyroxine- binding globulin (TBG) and cholesterol levels decreased, and ferritin and SHBG increased after L- T- 3 administration, while creatine kinase and retinol did not change throughout the study. There was {{a positive correlation between}} basal TSH and TSH peak response to TRH at basal condition and after each sequential L- T- 3 doses. On the other hand, TSH peak response to the TRH test did not predict cholesterol, TBG, ferritin, or SHBG values. Conclusion: Using the current methods on hormone and biochemical analysis, we standardized the response of many parameters to <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> after sequential and graded T- 3 suppression test in normal subjects. Our data suggest that the evaluation of {{the responses}} of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis to TRH test as well as the impact of L- T- 3 on peripheral tissues were not modified by the current methods...|$|E

Participants 2 ̆ 7 response to <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> was evaluated via TSH, total T 3, and T 4 levels at baseline and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Participants with HIV infection had a more robust response to <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> as measured by higher levels of TSH, lower levels of T 4 and modestly higher levels of T 3. Depressed persons had a reduced TSH response to stimulation and lower levels of both T 4 and T 3, although the effect of depression on T 4 was not statistically significant. These results suggest that TSH response to TRH-stimulation may be exaggerated in individuals with HIV infection but reduced in those with depression. They also suggest that the effects of depression and HIV infection may interact, and may provide a partial explanation for observed thyroid abnormalities in HIV-infected individuals. Results thus provide a partial explanation for findings on thyroid and depression in those affected by HIV infection...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A {{retrospective}} analysis {{was made of}} 405 thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests on children who were successful applicants for growth hormone (GH) therapy in the UK between 1977 and 1981 inclusive. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responses to TRH were divided into normal and those indicating pituitary or hypothalamic disease {{on the basis of}} criteria which eliminated variation in TSH assay between laboratories. Among children known to be hypothyroid 93 % had abnormal TRH stimulation tests, but 35 % of those children who were clinically euthyroid and who had normal serum thyroxin levels also had abnormal TSH responses to TRH. Abnormal TRH tests in the latter group were most common in euthyroid children who had GH deficiency with clearly defined aetiology and least common in those with idiopathic GH deficiency. Further work is required to clarify the interpretation of an abnormal <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> in this group of children, but until this is done, such patients should be kept under regular review with respect to thyroid function. Protirelin, or thyrotrophin-releasinghormone (TRH), is a tripeptide amine synthesised in the hypothalamus and a powerful stimulus to both thyroid-stimulatin...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{patterns}} of thyroid hormones [thyroxine (T 4) and 3, 3 ', 5 -triiodothyronine (T 3) ] and the T 4 and T 3 responses induced by {{thyrotropin releasing hormone}} (TRH) are reported in captive female barn owls (Tyto alba) during the non-breeding period. The main findings of the study, conducted on a total of 10 owls, are as follow: (1) The thyroid gland of barn owl can be stimulated by the classical <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test.</b> (2) T 3 response was much more pronounced both under cold (around 10 °C) and warm (around 20 °C) conditions, whereas T 4 response ranged so widely {{that we could not}} point out any significant change in it. (3) Basal T 3 plasma level was significantly (p = 0. 036) higher in birds exposed to cold temperature, and they responded to TRH treatment with a lower plasma T 3 elevation than the birds kept in a warm chamber. This pattern, however, cannot be explained by increased food intake, but is in agreement with the fact that enhanced T 3 level may account for higher avUCP mRNA expression, which results in higher heat production on the cell level. From the results it is concluded that altering T 3 plasma level plays a significant role in cold-induced thermoregulation...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} thyroid functions and subclinical hypothyroidism in obese children. Methods: Fourty three children with exogenous obesity and 17 aged matched idiopathic short stature children (control group) were studied with anthropometric indices and basal {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT 3), free thyroxine (fT 4), total thyroxine (TT 4) and total triiodothyronine (TT 3) levels and they all underwent thyrotropin releasing hormone (<b>TRH)</b> <b>stimulation</b> <b>test</b> to determine TSH response. Results: There were {{no significant difference in}} age, bone age, basal TSH, fT 3, fT 4, TT 4 levels between obese and control group. Total triiodothyronine levels of obese group were significantly higher than control group (p= 0. 009). The maximum increment of TSH levels (and # 61508; TSH) and peak TSH levels in obese group were significantly lower than the control group (p= 0. 021, p= 0. 04 respectively). We evaluated obese children for TSH response and divided them into two groups; obese group 1 (TSH response abnormally elevated) and obese group 2 (TSH response were normal), basal TSH levels of group 1 were found significantly higher than group 2 (p< 0. 001). Conclusion:. Thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation test may be helpful to determine subclinical hypothyroidism in exogen obese children, if basal TSH levels were elevated.

40|$|A high-performance-liquid-chromatography (h. p. l. c.) {{separation}} was developed, which resolves isomers of inositol monophosphate (IP), inositol bisphosphate (IP 2), and inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) in {{a single}} run. In GH 3 cells labelled with [3 H]inositol, treated with Li+ and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), radiolabelled components identified as inositol 1 -phosphate (I 1 P), inositol 2 -phosphate (I 2 P), inositol 4 -phosphate (I 4 P), inositol 1, 4 -bisphosphate [I(1, 4) P 2], inositol 1, 3, 4 -trisphosphate [I(1, 3, 4) P 3] and inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [I(1, 4, 5) P 3] are present, as are multiple unidentified IP 2 peaks. After <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation,</b> both I 1 P and I 4 P increase, the increase in I 4 P preceding that of I 1 P; I(1, 4) P 2 and an unknown IP 2 increase; and both I(1, 3, 4) P 3 and I(1, 4, 5) P 3 increase, the increase in I(1, 4, 5) P 3 being rapid and transient, whereas the increase in I(1, 3, 4) P 3 is slower and more sustained.

40|$|We {{measured}} thyrotropin in plasma by an ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay (TSH-IRMA, “Sucrosep, ” Boots-Ceiltech), {{before and}} after thyroliberin (<b>TRH)</b> <b>stimulation,</b> in 71 patients with suspected thyroid-function disorders. Thirty-three were taking amiodarone; none was receMng (anti) thy-rold drugs. The patients were divided into four groups, according to their TSH response to TRH (as measured previously by conventional TSH-R 1 A) and the concentrations of thyroxin (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) in their plasma.

40|$|Familial {{cerebellar}} ataxia with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism {{is a rare}} condition. Two affected siblings in a sibship of three were studied and found to have low plasma gonadotrophin levels. No rise in gonadotrophin levels was demonstrable after repeated stimulation with LHRH. The pattern of TSH and prolactin responses to <b>TRH</b> <b>stimulation</b> suggest hypothalamic dysfunction. The results clearly identify the cause of hypogonadism {{to be due to}} a defect in production or release of gonadotrophins by the pituitary gland and suggest that hypogonadism is part of a greater endocrine disturbance involving both the hypothalamus and pituitary...|$|R
