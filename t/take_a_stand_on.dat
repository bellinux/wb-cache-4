5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|Some feminists, such as Carole Pateman, {{believe that}} {{exploitation}} is in both prostitution and sex trafficking. They believe {{that even if}} the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option. Other feminists such as Kamala Kempadoo, on the other hand, believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor; however, due to the criminalization of prostitution, prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking. In the USA, each year 80,000 women are arrested for prostitution. Current debates about modifications to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 policy are based about these two arguments. In providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked. These people involved in prostitution have an 80% higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many never can afford to seek treatment. This results in serious infections, lifelong diseases, and sometimes even death.|$|E
500|$|With the Cabinet still {{divided between}} adherents of Green and Harkness, Diefenbaker {{made a speech}} in the Commons on January 25 that Fleming (by then Minister of Justice) termed [...] "a model of obfuscation". Harkness was {{initially}} convinced that Diefenbaker was saying that he would support nuclear warheads in Canada. After talking to the press, he realized that {{his view of the}} speech was not universally shared, and he asked Diefenbaker for clarification. Diefenbaker, however, continued to try to avoid taking a firm position. On January 30, the US State Department issued a press release suggesting that Diefenbaker had made misstatements in his Commons speech. For the first time ever, Canada recalled its ambassador to Washington as a diplomatic protest. Though all parties condemned the State Department action, the three parties outside the government demanded that Diefenbaker <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the nuclear weapon issue.|$|E

Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At {{the end of the}} month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states to put together the final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of [...] "well dressed, middle aged" [...] individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America [...] "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps Browner's biggest triumph came in 1997, {{when she}} {{convinced}} Clinton {{to support a}} stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot. [...] The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. [...] There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president's economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said {{the costs of the}} new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA's scientific reviews on the matter. [...] Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration's preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the matter, but he remained silent. [...] Browner's adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come {{in the face of a}} silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration. [...] Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. [...] Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton's final decision in Browner's favor. [...] Overall, the New York Times termed Browner's actions [...] "a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura" [...] and Time magazine labelled Browner the [...] "Queen of Clean Air". [...] As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns, Browner said: [...] "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125million Americans, including 35million children." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of Romania on December 30, 1947, the government {{formed by the}} PCR outlawed all Jewish organizations at a meeting on June 10–June 11, 1948, stating that [...] "the party must <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> every question concerning the Jews of Romania and fight vigorously against reactionary nationalist Jewish currents (that is, Zionism)". Between 1952 and 1953 the Stalinist antisemitic charges of [...] "rootless cosmopolitanism" [...] brought about the purging of the party's own leadership (including Jewish ex-premier and foreign minister Ana Pauker); the charges were then inflicted upon the larger part of the Jewish community, beginning with a trial engineered by Iosif Chișinevschi. Jews who were perceived as Zionists were given harsh labour sentences in communist prisons such as Pitești (where they were subject to torture and brainwashing experiments; {{a few of them}} died in detention). The 1952 trial of the engineers made responsible for the failure of the Danube-Black Sea Canal project also involved allegations of Zionism (notably aimed at Aurel Rozei-Rozenberg, who was eventually executed).|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the White House {{declined}} to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> the amendment, although Press Secretary Ari Fleischer relayed that President George W. Bush believed that marriage was {{between a man}} and a woman. In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2004, President Bush alluded to the recent court decision in Massachusetts ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages beginning in May: [...] "Activist judges ... have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives.... If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process." [...] On February 24, after the same Massachusetts court reiterated that it was insisting on marriage and that civil unions were insufficient, Bush expressed support for this amendment for the first time. In August, Vice President Dick Cheney neither endorsed nor condemned the FMA, arguing that same-sex marriage is an issue for the states to decide. In 2009, Cheney stated his support for same-sex marriage on a state-by-state basis.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1998 {{and early}} 1999, {{tensions}} between the Chrétien and Martin camps started {{to come out in}} the open with backbenchers loyal to the two men leaking unflattering stories to the press about their rival patrons. Chrétien rarely changed the composition of the Cabinet, and so as a result, there had emerged by the late 1990s a group of deeply disgruntled Liberal backbenchers, who believed themselves to be Cabinet-worthy MPs, and were extremely frustrated that the Prime Minister would not elevate them to the Cabinet. This group become Martin's strongest supporters as they believed that only by deposing Chrétien could they achieve the promotion to the Cabinet that they so desperately desired. A major advantage enjoyed by the Martin fraction was that in a process starting in 1995 they were able to take control of much of the Liberal Party apparatus reaching a point about 1999 where Martin supporters had an almost undisputed control of the Liberal party as opposed to the government. When asked in an interview about why Chrétien allowed this to happen, Sergio Marchi said: [...] "He just became complacent". Chrétien tended to focus his efforts on controlling the government via the PMO with one of his aides at the PMO Terry Mercer making the revealing remark during a meeting of the Liberal national executive in 1998 that: [...] "I don't work for the party, I work for Jean Chrétien". This tendency had become especially acute by the late 1990s when Chrétien was widely seen to have lost touch with the Liberal Party apparatus and caucus, and was described by Marchi as living in a [...] "bubble" [...] comprising himself and his people at the PMO with relations with those outside of the [...] "bubble" [...] growing more cold and distant as time went by. Chrétien was well aware of the Martin group and its ambitions, but as he believed that Martin had trouble making difficult decisions that the danger was minimal because [...] "Mr. Dithers" [...] Martin would never make up his mind. An additional problem for Martin in challenging Chrétien was that beyond the differences between Chrétien's [...] "hard federalist" [...] approach to Quebec and Martin's [...] "soft federalist" [...] approach, there were no major policy differences between him and the Prime Minister. Since the Clarity Act and Chrétien's entire [...] "Plan B" [...] approach to Quebec were very popular in English Canada, challenging Chrétien on that issue was considered to be unwise, and with no other issue to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> <b>on,</b> it was hard for Martin to make a case that Chrétien needed to go. Martin was not very likely to rally much support in English Canada on the thesis that Chrétien needed to be deposed because he was being too tough with the separatist government in Quebec City. Through Martin did not publicly oppose the Clarity Act, he also initially refused to voice support for it in public and several of his aides and Martinista MPs leaked the news to the media that the Finance Minister did not believe that the Clarity Act was a wise piece of legislation.|$|E
