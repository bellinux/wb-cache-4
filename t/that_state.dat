40|$|Abstract. Erga omnes {{norms are}} those <b>that</b> give {{third-party}} <b>states,</b> {{rather than just}} the victim, legal claims against <b>states</b> <b>that</b> violate them. This paper argues that ordinary two-party norms arise when <b>states</b> recognize <b>that</b> a norm violation injures only one <b>state</b> and <b>that</b> other <b>states</b> <b>that</b> seek to retaliate on <b>that</b> <b>state’s</b> behalf are likely using the violation as a pretext for predatory behavior. Erga omnes norms arise when <b>states</b> recognize <b>that</b> a norm violation injures multiple <b>states</b> and <b>that</b> <b>states</b> {{have an incentive to}} free ride rather than retaliate against the violator. Erga omnes norms reduce the incentive to free ride {{but at the same time}} reintroduce the risk <b>that</b> some <b>states</b> will use a norm violation as a pretext for engaging in predatory behavior...|$|R

Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E
