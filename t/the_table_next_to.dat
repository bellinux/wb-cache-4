500|$|Roger asks Peggy {{to devise}} a new Mohawk Airlines {{campaign}} over the weekend, {{in an attempt to}} cover for {{the fact that he had}} neglected to put the creative team on that task a week earlier. Peggy, realizing that for once she has the upper hand, agrees to the favor only after Roger hands over all the cash in his wallet ($410, an exorbitant amount in 1966), rejecting the ten dollars which Roger initially offered her (explaining that [...] "the work is ten dollars; the lie is extra."). While working late, Peggy discovers Dawn sleeping in Don's office. Peggy offers Dawn a spot on her couch at home, as Dawn worries about returning to her own home in Harlem due to racial tension in the area. Peggy and Dawn drink beers at Peggy's apartment, while Peggy reveals insecurity over whether she [...] "acts like a man" [...] or not. While leaving her apartment's living room, Peggy has an awkward moment with Dawn when Peggy realizes that her purse (with Roger's cash still inside) is alone on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Dawn. Peggy cleans up and leaves the purse next to Dawn. Peggy wakes up the next morning to find a note from Dawn apologizing for inconveniencing Peggy.|$|E
500|$|John is also {{surprised}} to discover that Sherlock is in a relationship with Mary's bridesmaid, Janine. Sherlock tells John that he is dating her because she is Magnussen's personal assistant, and he uses their relationship to assist him with breaking into Magnussen's office in London. Inside, Sherlock and John find an incapacitated Janine, and Sherlock happens upon Mary holding Magnussen at gunpoint. Mary shoots Sherlock, who harnesses all his mental powers to stay conscious. He is taken to hospital. In his mind palace, Sherlock fades away, {{at the same time in}} the real world Sherlock dies on the operating table in pre-op preparation. In the mind palace, Moriarty convinces Sherlock that he's letting John down by dying, which convinces the mind palace Sherlock to wake up and escape. [...] At this time, in the real world, Sherlock's heart begins to beat again. [...] The surgeons attempt to help revive him, by giving him oxygen. Sherlock wakes up in surgery and mouths [...] "Mary". [...] Mary comes into the hospital and is met by John, who says that Sherlock had survived surgery. Mary visits the dazed and severely injured Sherlock and warns him not to denounce her. John nonetheless begins to suspect something after he finds that Sherlock replaced John's chair in the Baker Street flat and left a bottle of Mary's perfume on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{coming to}} Boston, on 23 April 1912, `Abdu'l-Bahá {{attended}} several events. One was a reception in Washington D. C. by the Persian Charge D'Affaires [...] Ali Kuli Khan, and the Turkish Ambassador; at this reception `Abdu'l-Bahá moved the place-names {{such that the}} only African-American present, Louis G. Gregory, was seated {{at the head of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> himself, an event that was highly noted at the time and since. One of the early versions of the story of this event was told by Harlan Ober.|$|E

5000|$|Alex and Sebastian made {{a promise}} to get back the money which their father {{supposedly}} left for them. Alex would do everything to retrieve back what is rightfully theirs. Now, Lucille is against them as well until several circumstances will change their lives when Alex becomes even more desperate for money and she is determined to strike vengeance against Lucille. Eventually, Lucille turned <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her favors when she started a connivance with Alex and assured to pay her handsomely in exchange for her services.|$|R
5000|$|When {{he reached}} the classroom, Milagros was {{surprised}} by the elegance and personality of the man. He was 52 years old, completely white hair, handsome, an extraordinarily handsome, say women type. He was at <b>the</b> head <b>table,</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Jimmy Duran, Washington Peña, Eduardo Tavarez, Antonio Canto, José Andrés Aybar Sánchez, Arnaldo Sención and ... who could not miss, José Francisco Peña Gómez.|$|R
2500|$|The crucifix, {{painting}} of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is [...] "an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character {{not found in the}} text." [...] By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix [...] "may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms", a very Catholic idea. Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.|$|E

60|$|Instead {{of calling}} the waiter, Mr Sloper went {{himself to the}} bar to fetch the liquor. While he was thus engaged, Miles glanced round the room, and was {{particularly}} struck {{with the appearance of}} a large, fine-looking sailor who sat at <b>the</b> small <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him, with hands thrust deep into his trousers-pockets, his chin resting on his broad chest, and a solemn, owlish stare in his semi-drunken yet manly countenance. He sat alone, and was obviously in a very sulky frame of mind--a condition which he occasionally indicated through a growl of dissatisfaction.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a loud}} buzz of conversation, and Philip listened attentively to {{that between}} four gentlemen who had just sat down at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> him. Three of them had come in together, and the fourth joined them, just as Philip's meal was brought to him.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly Guy {{was between}} her and Mrs. Gresham. She {{did not try to}} speak to him, and was amused by his fitful {{attempts}} at making conversation with Mrs. Gresham, when it struck him that he ought to be taking notice of her. Amy (very fortunately, in her own opinion) was out of sight of him, {{on the same side of}} <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Ross, who, like his daughter, guessed enough about the state of things to let her alone.|$|E
60|$|Just {{before the}} Bond Street Tube station {{they crossed the}} road, Tommy, unperceived, {{faithfully}} at their heels, and entered the big Lyons'. There they {{went up to the}} first floor, and sat at a small table in the window. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat at <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case of recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man and studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly.|$|E
60|$|At Ringwood they lunched, and Jessie {{met with}} a disappointment. There was no letter for her at the post office. Opposite the hotel, The Chequered Career, was a machine shop with a conspicuously {{second-hand}} Marlborough Club tandem tricycle displayed in the window, together with the announcement that bicycles and tricycles were on hire within. The establishment was impressed on Mr. Hoopdriver's mind by the proprietor's action in coming across the road and narrowly inspecting their machines. His action revived a number of disagreeable impressions, but, happily, came to nothing. While they were still lunching, a tall clergyman, with a heated face, entered the room {{and sat down at}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> theirs. He was in a kind of holiday costume; that is to say, he had a more than usually high collar, fastened behind and rather the worse for the weather, and his long-tail coat had been replaced by a black jacket of quite remarkable brevity. He had faded brown shoes on his feet, his trouser legs were grey with dust, and he wore a hat of piebald straw in the place of the customary soft felt. He was evidently socially inclined.|$|E
5000|$|Okalena Patricia Lekanoff-Gregory, Unalaska Aleut artist, {{has been}} one of Gronholdt's more {{prolific}} students, having instructed classes throughout the Aleutians and Northwest United States.

An important component of Aleut values is to acknowledge Unangax elders. In 2011 Lekanoff-Gregory worked with the Smithsonian's Arctic Studies Center to produce a video titled [...] in which she provides an overview of how the bentwood hats are carved, steamed, and bent. Lekanoff-Gregory also honors having learned chagudax from Gronholdt.|$|R
50|$|Shari's {{restaurants}} are notable for their patented hexagonal design. The Bergquists originally sought {{to sell their}} patented idea to another company, but when {{they were unable to}} find a restaurant company willing to buy they started their own chain in Hermiston.

6000|$|By {{this time}} Clara had {{recognised}} her picture-gallery acquaintances, and, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences. [...] "I met them {{first in the}} Royal Academy--and they were very kind to me--and they were lunching at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>table</b> <b>to</b> us, just now, you know--and they tried to help me to find the picture I wanted--and I'm sure they're dear old things!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then again {{came up the}} {{question}} of her position at supper, {{but there was no}} difficulty in the arrangement made between them. The one gala evening of grand dresses--the evening which had been intended to be a gala, but which {{had turned out to be}} almost funereal--was over. Even Michel Voss himself did not think it necessary that Marie should come in to supper with her silk dress two nights running; and he himself had found that that changing of his coat had impaired his comfort. He could eat his dinner and his supper in his best clothes on Sunday, and not feel the inconvenience; but on other occasions those unaccustomed garments were as heavy to him as a suit of armour. There was, therefore, nothing more said about clothes. Marie was to dispense her soup as usual,--expressing a confident assurance that if Peter were as yet to attempt this special branch of duty, the whole supper would collapse,--and then she was to take her place at <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her uncle. Everybody in the house, everybody in Granpere, knew that the marriage had been arranged, and the old lady who had been so dreadfully snubbed by Marie, had forgiven the offence, acknowledging that Marie's position on that evening had been one of difficulty.|$|E

50|$|After the {{successful}} operation of Ishmael (Ariel Rivera), Sara (Julia Montes) had finally {{returned to her}} house, while Kara (Julia Montes) stayed with her family at the new house she recently bought. Upon learning that both Kara and Sara had retrieved back their inheritance, an envious Alex (Maxene Magalona) desires to meet the same favorable fortune of the twins. Alex and Sebastian (Sam Milby) {{made a promise to}} get back the money which their father supposedly left for them. Alex would do everything to retrieve back what is rightfully theirs. Now, Lucille (Carmina Villarroel) is against them as well until several circumstances will change their lives when Alex becomes even more desperate for money and she is determined to strike vengeance against Lucille. Eventually, Lucille turned <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her favors when she started a connivance with Alex and assured to pay her handsomely in exchange for her services. Lucille ordered Alex to lure Sara by convincing her to invest her money to a fraud, while she deals with Kara's unwary temperament in an attempt to pester with her family. Filled with suspicions and doubts towards her mother's sudden closeness, Kara investigates Lucille's true intentions. Kara upon discovering her mother's schemes and Alex's involvement with Lucille, she told an enraged Sara the truth and finally decided to choose her immediate family. Sara is still hopeless to get back the money from Lucille since she already gave it to Alex. Sara catches Alex but she freely escaped from them but then she was kidnapped by a man ordered by Lucille. Sebastian searched for his sister everywhere and even sought help from the policemen but she is nowhere to be found until the court date arrives.|$|R
