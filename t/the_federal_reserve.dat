40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} that affected market liquidity during the recent financial crisis, and how this setting resulted in a systemic breakdown in the economy. We also review <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> actions and provide empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional monetary policy in providing market liquidity during the crisis. We use a dataset consisting of an aggregate market liquidity measure and individual program data on <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> activity to analyze the market impact of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> balance sheet programs. In baseline regressions we find no statistically significant evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserves</b> unconventional policies had an impact on market liquidity. However, in asymmetric tests, we find that positive changes in the QE 1 large-scale asset purchase program and the liquidity to key credit markets program had a statistically significant impact on the market liquidity measure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the response of}} the term structure of interest rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the pre- and post-October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two competing hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects are formally specified and compared to the estimated responses. Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they have sharply different implications about <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> short-run monetary policy. The expected inflation hypothesis implies that weekly money surprises should have persistent effects on the level of the money stock, reflecting shifts in <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> long-run target. In contrast, the policy anticipations hypothesis implies that the effectof money surprises should diminish over time, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve's</b> desire to offset deviations from target. Additional empirical results reported in the paper support this latter description of the money stock process. ...|$|R
