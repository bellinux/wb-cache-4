5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>her</b> {{marriage}} to Spencer was dissolved, Wallis had {{become involved with}} Ernest Aldrich Simpson, an Anglo-American shipping executive and former officer in the Coldstream Guards. He divorced his first wife, Dorothea (by whom he had a daughter, Audrey), to marry Wallis on 21 July 1928 at the Register Office in Chelsea, London.

5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} the Peter Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when alerted to the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him {{for a lack of}} originality. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>her</b> eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E

5|$|The {{family moved}} to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, {{she was forced to}} find employment; she did {{domestic}} work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Her</b> mother worked for white families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hu Die {{declined}} to renew her contract with Tianyi, and {{signed with the}} rival Mingxing (Star) Film Company, led by the shrewd businessman and director Zhang Shichuan, and the talented writer Zheng Zhengqiu. She had a salary of $1,000 a month, a large sum at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Her</b> first film with Mingxing was Tower in the White Clouds (1928). She befriended her co-star Ruan Lingyu; the two women would become China's biggest film stars of the 1930s. Her role as Red Girl in the film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928) propelled her to stardom. The film was such a success that the studio made 17 sequels {{of the same name}} between 1928 and 1931. It started a craze for martial arts films, but also attracted criticism from intellectuals when children neglected their schoolwork to study martial arts or devote themselves to martial arts fiction.|$|E

5000|$|None of {{the primary}} sources mention the age of Helena at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>her</b> marriage. <b>The</b> History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon does comment on her age.

Fausta had died in 326. Which would mean Helena was at least twenty-nine years old at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>her</b> marriage.|$|R

25|$|While {{many women}} {{including}} Norton were wary of organized movements, {{their actions and}} words often motivated and inspired such movements. Among these was Florence Nightingale, whose conviction that women had all the potential of men {{but none of the}} opportunities impelled her storied nursing career. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>her</b> feminine virtues were emphasized over her ingenuity, an example of the bias against acknowledging female accomplishment in the mid-1800s.|$|E
25|$|Nazimova soon felt {{confident}} enough in her abilities to begin producing and writing films {{in which she}} also starred. In her film adaptations of works by such notable writers as Oscar Wilde and Ibsen, she developed her own filmmaking techniques, which were considered daring at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Her</b> projects, including A Doll's House (1922), based on Ibsen, and Salomé (1923), based on Wilde's play, were critical and commercial failures.|$|E

These years of wild youth left Alice with a chronic melancholia; it is possible that she suffered from cyclothymia, a strain of bipolar disorder.|$|E
