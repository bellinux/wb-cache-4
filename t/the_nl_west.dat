The next longest streak is by the Cincinnati Reds, who most {{recently}} finished {{in last place}} of the NL in 1982. The similar streak in the American League is held by the Boston Red Sox, who last finished in last place of the AL in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Hershiser {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to pitch against the NL-leading New York Mets (80–54) on Sunday, September 4, but a rainout delayed his performance. The Dodgers entered the game with a 77–57 record and a 5-game lead in <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over the Astros, while the Atlanta Braves were 31 games back in sixth place in the division with a 46–88 record entering the game. With the September 5 win, the Dodgers retained their 5-game lead. Hershiser struck out Dale Murphy four times, once resorting to a rare sidearm curveball to do so, to the dismay of pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who worried about injuries caused by sidearm pitching. According to ESPN's Mark Simon, this was the only game of Murphy's 2,180-game career in which a single pitcher struck him out four times. After a two-out walk to Dion James in the third inning, Hershiser allowed no baserunners until the ninth inning. With his fourth straight complete game, Hershiser raised his record to 19–8, making him 3–1 with a 1.00 ERA in those games.|$|E
5|$|López {{reached the}} playoffs as the Giants won <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> {{for the first}} time since 2003. He made two {{appearances}} in the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves to face Jason Heyward, whom he struck out both times. The Giants won the series in four games. Against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS, he made five appearances, all scoreless except for Game 4, in which he allowed a run. In the deciding Game 6, he pitched a scoreless seventh inning and was awarded with a win after Juan Uribe hit a game-winning home run against Ryan Madson in the eighth inning. López made two appearances against the Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, striking out the two batters he faced. In Game 2, he struck out Josh Hamilton to end the top of the eighth inning with a runner on second and preserve a 2–0 lead, although the Giants went on to win 9–0. He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.|$|E
5000|$|Shortstop José Reyes was {{mentioned}} at mid-season {{as a possible}} MVP. Pedro Martínez notched his 3,000th strikeout. Tom Glavine got his 300th win. The team went into Wrigley Field in August and took two of three from <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> Central's first place Cubs, then beat up on <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West's</b> first place Diamondbacks a week later. Despite being swept by the second place Phillies in a four-game series in Philadelphia on August 27-30 (during which the Mets saw their six-game lead evaporate to two), the Mets won nine out of their next ten games, and everything was seemingly going the Mets' way. On September 12, the Mets were 21 games over [...]500 {{with a record of}} 83-62. Over the last three weeks of the baseball season, they won only five games.|$|R
50|$|Sand {{was also}} a leader in bases on balls, walking 82 times in 1923 (2nd in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> 52 times in 1924 (10th in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> 64 times in 1925 (6th in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> and 66 times in 1926 (2nd in <b>the</b> <b>NL).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{statistic}} {{that stands}} out above all others with Sand was his propensity to strike out. He was among the top 10 batters in strikeouts in all six of his major league seasons, striking out 56 times in his rookie season in 1923 (5th highest in <b>the</b> National League (<b>NL)),</b> 57 in 1924 (3rd highest in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> 65 in 1925 (2nd highest in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> 56 in 1926 (6th highest in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> 59 in 1927 (3rd highest in <b>the</b> <b>NL),</b> and 49 in his final season in 1928 (9th highest in <b>the</b> <b>NL).</b>|$|R
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 76–54 record and a 6.5-game lead in <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> over the Houston Astros, while the Montreal Expos were 11 games back in third place in the NL East with a 66–64 record {{entering}} the game. With the August 30 win, the Dodgers retained their 6.5-game lead. The win marked the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win and twelfth out of 15. Hershiser contributed a two-run double in the second inning to help the Dodgers build a 3–0 lead. After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth, no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings, thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak. The game marked Hershiser's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season. Following the game, his 2.84 ERA ranked third on the team behind Tim Leary (2.44) and John Tudor (2.37).|$|E
5|$|During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale {{maintained}} {{the record for}} consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics {{and the start of}} the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Additionally, baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, limiting the games' visibility {{to the rest of the}} country. Controversially, KTTV did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record. Instead, it showed Friday the 13th and The Funhouse on September 26 and 28, respectively. The record-setting game drew an attendance of 22,596.|$|E

5|$|The Houston Astros hired Virdon {{as their}} manager on August 20, 1975, {{succeeding}} Preston Gómez. Tal Smith, {{who had served}} as {{executive vice president for}} the Yankees, had become the Astros' general manager on August 7. Virdon led the Astros to third-place finishes in 1976 and 1977, but the Astros slipped to fifth place in 1978. The 1979 Astros fell one game short of winning <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> <b>West</b> division championship. The Astros tied the Los Angeles Dodgers for the division championship in 1980, and defeated them in the 1980 NL West tie-breaker game. The Astros played the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 NLCS, losing the series in five games. He again won the Manager of the Year Award in 1980. Due to the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, the 1981 season was split into halves with each half's winner appearing in the 1981 NL Division Series. The Dodgers won the first half, while the Astros won the second. In the Division Series, the Dodgers defeated the Astros in five games. During the 1982 season, the Astros fell to fifth place. Virdon was fired during the season and replaced by Bob Lillis.|$|E

In a preliminary study, we created <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> inventory, and 274 subjects (35 working people and 239 university students) completed <b>the</b> <b>NL</b> questionnaire. An exploratory factorial analysis was conducted, and after that the questionnaire was revised for the next studies. In the first study, 240 university students completed the questionnaire. Exploratory factorial analyses extracted four factors which could be called (1) "denial of naïve knowledge," (2) "perspective on neuroscience," (3) "allowance of neuroscience research," and (4) "allowance of practical applications of neuroscience research.
