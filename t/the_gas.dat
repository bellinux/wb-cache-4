5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Gas</b> Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. <b>The</b> <b>gas</b> was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Compression of {{ambient air}} causes a {{temperature}} rise of <b>the</b> <b>gas,</b> {{proportional to the}} pressure increase.

40|$|EP 983965 A UPAB: 20000412 NOVELTY - A {{secondary}} gas stream is injected into <b>the</b> main <b>gas</b> stream {{in a mixing}} chamber at an angle of 10 - 170 deg. to <b>the</b> main <b>gas</b> stream. <b>The</b> flow cross-section of <b>the</b> main <b>gas</b> stream before <b>the</b> injection site of <b>the</b> secondary <b>gas</b> stream into <b>the</b> main <b>gas</b> stream is reduced {{in such a way}} that the flow speed of <b>the</b> main <b>gas</b> stream is increased.

40|$|Gases may {{be trapped}} in {{crystallizing}} minerals {{in many different}} ways but gas analyses can provide geologically meaningful information only if <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> can be related to their specific locations in the host mineral. <b>The</b> <b>gases</b> trapped in glass inclusions can be representative samples of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> associated with <b>the</b> magma adjacent to the mineral at the time it crystallized. Analyses of <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> in glass inclusions in gabbro 15065, 44 and basalt 15016, 48 show that in both cases <b>the</b> <b>gases</b> in <b>the</b> parent magma started with a composition close to 46 % oxygen, 42 % carbon and 12 % hydrogen and became more water-rich as crystallization progressed. This enrichment is probably due to a selective removal of the less soluble carbon compounds into the vapor phase.

5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> has been used.|$|E
5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> chambers and lived on site at the crematoria.

[...] Mainstream historians have often noted that it is highly unlikely Böck could have casually been brought to <b>the</b> <b>gassing</b> compound by a friend, and even less likely that he would have been allowed inside <b>the</b> <b>gassing</b> facility to personally witness the killing and disposal of the bodies.|$|R

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm.
