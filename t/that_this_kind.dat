25|$|Selection, whether {{natural or}} artificial, changes the {{frequency}} of morphs within a population; this occurs when morphs reproduce with different degrees of success.

25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to imagination is that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to envision the experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others. Martin and Sugarman write <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E
25|$|Put otherwise, {{mainstream}} theories rarely, if at all, {{acknowledge that}} it is through relationships, via Dasein's inescapable relational nature, that symptoms and client needs emerge, therefore inadvertently limiting their ability to explain the emergence of said symptoms and needs {{in the life of}} the client. Furthermore, this causes psychotherapy to perpetuate the paradigm that human beings are highly autonomous individuals responding primarily to cognitive reason, taking them out of their relational contexts in the world and limiting human beings to find healing purely from within. Ontological hermeneutics theory states <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of relational de-contextualizing actually leads to a form of individualism that is inauthentic and can also result in interpersonal problems that cause human suffering because the individual is ultimately collapsing into an empty self.|$|E
25|$|Tomasello argues <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of {{bi-directional}} cognition {{is central}} to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.|$|E

25|$|In 1772 the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, having {{issued a}} decree forbidding burial {{on the day}} of death, the Jews in his territories {{approached}} Emden with the request that he demonstrate from the Talmud that a longer exposure of a corpse would be against the Law. Emden referred them to Mendelssohn, who had great influence with Christian authorities and wrote in excellent German. Mendelssohn wrote the requested letter to the Duke, but privately complained to Emden that based on the Talmud, it seemed the Duke was correct. Emden wrote to him in strong terms, saying that it was ludicrous to assert that the custom of the entire Jewish people was blatantly incorrect, and told Mendelssohn <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of claim would only strengthen rumors of irreligiousness he (Mendelssohn) had aroused by his associations.|$|E
25|$|Some Federal Circuit {{decision}}s, however, {{had held}} some transformations of signals and data patent-eligible. For example, the Abele decision approved a dependent {{claim to a}} method transforming X-ray attenuation data produced in a X-Y field by an X-ray tomographic scanner to an image of body organs and bones — {{while at the same}} time the Abele court rejected a more generic and abstract independent claim to a process of graphically displaying variances from their average values of unspecified data obtained in an unspecified manner. The court said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of difference between the two claims was critical to patent-eligibility. The dependent claim, unlike the independent claim, involved signal data representing tangible physical objects, which were electronically manipulated to provide a screen image of the physical objects. But Bilski's process had nothing to do with such a procedure. Like State Street, Bilski involved manipulation of financial data.|$|E

Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would.

25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E
25|$|Legionary {{soldiers}} of the 1st and 2nd centuries {{used a variety of}} armour types. Some wore mail shirts, while others wore scale armour or lorica segmentata or laminated-strip cuirass. This last type was a complex piece of armour which in certain circumstances provided superior protection to the other types of Roman armour, mail armour (lorica hamata) and scale armour (lorica squamata). The testing of modern replicas has demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of armour was impenetrable to most direct hits and missile strikes. It was, however, uncomfortable without padding: re-enactors have confirmed that wearing a padded undergarment known as a 'subarmalis' relieves the wearer from bruising both from prolonged wear and from shock produced by weapon blows against the armour. It was also expensive to produce and difficult to maintain. In the 3rd century, the segmentata appears to have been dropped and troops are depicted wearing mail armour (mainly) or scale, the standard armour of the 2nd-century auxilia. The artistic record shows that most late soldiers wore metal armour, despite Vegetius' statement to the contrary. For example, illustrations in the Notitia show that the army's fabricae (arms factories) were producing mail armour {{at the end of the}} 4th century. Actual examples of both scale armour and quite large sections of mail have been recovered, at Trier and Weiler-La-Tour respectively, within 4th-century contexts. Officers generally seem to have worn bronze or iron cuirasses, as in the days of the principate, together with traditional pteruges.|$|E
