40|$|In {{developing}} micro-spindle units, {{a critical}} problem is miniaturization of the <b>tool</b> <b>clamp.</b> Approaches for scaling down conventional tool clamps, {{such as the}} collet-chuck, hydraulic chuck, and shrink-fit methods may be limited by their inherently complicated mechanisms. This study developed a novel <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> based on shape memory alloy (SMA), which allows further miniaturization. The <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> can be simplified by using an SMA ring, which {{is all that is}} needed for clamping. The SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> does not require any collet, and its structural configuration is axisymmetric. Furthermore, the SMA makes it possible to switch between the clamped and unclamped states by using a simple device to regulate small changes in temperature. This paper first describes the operating principle of the SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp.</b> Second, it presents the finite element method (FEM) analyses that were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the clamping/unclamping operations and the effect of centrifugal force. Third, it describes a prototype of the SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp,</b> which was designed and built for applications in micro-spindle units. Fourth, it presents an evaluation of the time needed for the clamping/unclamping operations and the tool-clamping force, which were both evaluated experimentally. Finally, it describes a mill-machining test conducted with the prototype, which confirmed that the <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> is little affected by centrifugal force at high rotational speeds. The experimental results confirm that the proposed SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> can be successfully applied to micro-machining. close...|$|E
40|$|Some Neandertal {{anterior}} teeth show unusual and excessive gross wear, commonly explained by non-dietary anterior tooth use, or using the anterior dentition as a <b>tool,</b> <b>clamp,</b> or third hand. This alternate use is inferred from aboriginal arctic populations, who used their front teeth in this manner. Here we examine anterior dental microwear textures of the Krapina Neandertals {{to test this}} hypothesis and further analyze tooth use in these hominins. Microwear textures from 17 Krapina Dental People were collected by white-light confocal profilometry using a 100 x objective lens. Four adjacent scans were generated, totaling an area of 204 x 276 μm, and were analyzed using Toothfrax and SFrax SSFA software packages. The Neandertals were compared to six bioarchaeological/ethnographic samples with reported variation in diet, abrasive load, and non-dietary anterior tooth use. Results indicate that Krapina {{anterior teeth}} lack extreme microwear textures expected of hominins exposed to heavy abrasives or those that regularly generated high stresses associated with intense use of the front teeth as tools. Krapina hominins have microwear attributes in common with Coast Tsimshian, Aleut, and Puye Pueblo samples. Collectively, this suggests that the Krapina Neandertals faced moderate abrasive loads and only periodically used their anterior teeth as tools for non-diet related behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Chatter in {{machining}} process {{is one of}} the common failures of a production line. For a cantilever tool, such as a boring bar, the rule of thumb requires the overhang length of the tool to be less than 4 times the diameter. The reason is because longer overhang will induce severe tool vibration in the form of chatter during machining. When a longer overhang than 4 times diameter is necessary for performing special machining operations, damping methods are needed to suppress tool chatter. One of the methods is the constrained layer damping method. Materials, such viscoelastic material, are applied in the vibration node regions of the structure to absorb the concentrated vibration strain energy and transform the mechanical energy to heat. With a cantilever <b>tool</b> <b>clamped</b> in a <b>tool</b> holder, the <b>clamping</b> interface is usually the vibration node region. The friction in the joint interface with low normal pressure became another source of damping and can be used for tool chatter suppression in mechanical structures. Joint interfaces are well known to possess normal pressure dependent stiffness and damping. The normal pressure’s effect on the structures frequency response function had been observed by H. Åkesson [1] et al, and L. Mi [2] et al. However, the direct effect of the joint interface normal pressure on {{machining process}} stability hasn’t been investigated. In this paper, a cantilever tool with 6. 5 overhang length to diameter ratio is investigated. The direct effect of the <b>tool</b> <b>clamping</b> interface’s normal pressure on the machining process stability is studied. Three different levels of clamping normal pressure are tested with an internal turning process. The machining results indicate another adaptable solution on shop floor for suppressing tool chatter.

40|$|AbstractGear hobbing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} manufacturing processes for cylindrical gears. The quality of the gears is a result of the tool quality, the precision of the workpiece, <b>tool</b> <b>clamping</b> and kinematics of the machine. The dry gear hobbing process allows machining of gears with a quality according to the DIN standard of up to IT 5. To evaluate which gear quality is possible to machine with a given clamping and hob it is useful to simulate the process in advance. This is also an opportunity to order the required quality of the hob according to its application. The objective presented in this paper is to simulate non-ideal gear hobbing processes and to calculate the geometry and topography of the workpiece. To achieve this goal, a simulation for continuous gear hobbing was developed. By calculating planar intersections of transverse sections of both gear and tool, the resulting gear geometry is determined. Beside it is possible to calculate different characteristic values for the hobbing process such as chip thickness and cutting volume. By an evaluation of <b>tool</b> and <b>clamping</b> tolerances these deviations can be used to modify the simulation model. Afterwards a non-ideal hobbing simulation can be performed and the resulting gear geometry can be analyzed using a virtual measurement machine. An advantage of this non-ideal simulation is also the possibility of calculating the tool load taking these deviations into account and to use the results for further process designs to reduce the risk of tool failure. The virtual measurement machine analyses the geometry according to VDI/VDE  2612 / 2607 and DIN  3961. The resulting measurements of the flank and lead lines can be used for a classification of the gear quality. By using this simulation program it is possible to reduce the costs and time effort of setting up a new hobbing process...|$|R

However, instabilities such as regenerative chatter can also be observed in micro milling processes using filigree cemented carbide end mills.

The analysis {{results show that the}} differences between the diametral deformations of the tool holder in high temperature and that in low temperature are increased according to amounts of the interference. Thus the less interference between the tool-holder and the ring, the less tolerance to allow the clamping and unclamping operation because the inner diameter of the tool holder in high temperature should be smaller than the diameter of the tool shank, and that in low temperature should be larger than the diameter of the tool shank. In addition, the design for maximization of clamping force are investigated based on finite element analysis. The results show that the more amounts of the interference, the more clamping force.
