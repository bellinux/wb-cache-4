A brief introduction into the general field of nanomaterials is also provided. The focus of this thesis is split into two main areas: Firstly, the preparation of indium and gallium chalcogenide nanomaterials due to their possible improved applications in solar cell technology. Secondly, the attempted preparation of novel tantalum nitride nanomaterials by conventional synthetic methods. These materials may provide effective environmentally benign replacements in situations where existing compounds' toxicities prove unacceptable. This thesis is divided into five main chapters and one appendix. The first chapter introduces the general field of nanomaterials and possible ways of utilising their properties {{in a variety of}} applications. It also contains a brief literature review of the materials covered in later chapters. Chapters two, three and four describe <b>the</b> research <b>undertaken</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> synthesis and characterisation of the aforementioned nanomaterials.

40|$|In {{applications}} where {{weight saving}} and parts integration can be achieved, the Rover Group {{has been investigating}} the design and manufacture of components from composite materials. The methods used in the different steps in the design-to-manufacture cycle in the high volume automotive industry are relatively well known for a steel component, but are not so well established for a composite component. A design methodology for composites has been emerging in which a principal procedure is design analysis. One of the most established methods of analysis is that using the finite element technique, and this is being supplemented with experimental tests on prototypes using photoelastic analysis and stress pattern analysis by thermal emission, coupled with conventional strain gauge monitoring.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{research}} <b>undertaken</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> {{analysis of}} original Byzantine mortars {{and the study}} of new compatible lime-based mixtures, for conservation purposes, which present enhanced resistance to sulphates. The thesis focuses on the effect of barium hydroxide, as an additive, to both the physicochemical properties and the durability of conservation mortars. Both binary pastes and mortar mixtures, containing varying amounts of barium hydroxide, were prepared and their physicochemical properties and durability determined. Comparisons were made with a reference mixture containing no barium hydroxide. The laboratory mixtures were synthesised according to the analysis of original mortars, collected from six different Byzantine mosaic pavements. The durability of the mortar mixtures against sulphate action was studied through the use of accelerated aging tests: crystallisation of soluble salts; electrochemical degradation; sulphate fixation; and resistance to leaching of cementing material. The results of these tests were considered together with the physical properties of the mortars, since these also influence their durability. From the interpretation of the results it was shown that the setting of lime-based barium mixtures can be described by two mechanisms; the carbonation process of calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide; and the precipitation of a barium calcium carbonate [BaCa(CO 3) 2] solid solution. It has been shown that the presence of barium hydroxide in lime-based mortars has a physical effect on the pore space characteristics of the mortar. It has also been shown that its presence improves the durability of the mortar, playing a protective role against sulphate attack. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the results of studies upon the rate of copper evaporation from liquid Fe-Cu alloys. Based on the results obtained for the change in the copper concentration in liquid bath, the value of the overall copper mass transfer coefficient was estimated. Due {{to the fact that the}} alloy composition may affect all the constituent stages of the evaporation process, <b>the</b> analysis <b>undertaken</b> <b>concerned</b> both <b>the</b> mass penetration process occurring in the liquid phase and the evaporation reaction taking place on the interface. Design/methodology/approach: The studies of the copper evaporation from liquid steel were conducted using an induction furnace. Based on the results obtained for the change in the copper concentration in liquid bath, the value of the overall copper mass transfer coefficient was estimated. The studies were conducted under the pressures of 0. 06 Pa and 101 Pa at the temperature of 1998 K. The copper content in the alloys examined varied from 0. 198 to 1. 518 % by weight. Findings: The overall mass transfer coefficients established based on the study results assumed values within the range from 4. 2 10 - 5 to 4. 8 10 - 5 ms- 1 for the tests conducted under the pressure of 0. 06 Pa and from 8. 3 10 - 6 to 1. 0 10 - 5 ms- 1. for those conducted under the pressure of 101 Pa. Practical implications: The main point of the EAF process is a transfer of the scrap components to the steel being melted. Some metals introduced into the bath together with the scrap may exert a negative impact on its properties. An example of such a contaminant may be copper. This metal is characterised by limited solubility in iron and it is released on grain boundaries at temperatures of hot processing. Originality/value: The studies conducted proved that, for the pressure of 0. 06 Pa, the overall mass transfer coefficient value on the copper content in the alloy increased from 0. 198 to 1. 518 % by weight grows by ca. 15 %. This growth is caused by numerous factors including the increase in the value of the copper activity coefficient in liquid iron...|$|R

Among other difficulties that emerged regarding the implementation of the recommendations contained in this document where, that many personnel working within the health board had been trained into the old system, and the highly influential voluntary organisations, particularly the Minnesota Model, conflicted also at almost every point.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between governance {{and the performance}} of microfinance institutions (MFIs) is discussed in this paper. MFI performance encompasses both financial performance and outreach. Good governance in terms of strengthening stewardship, achievement of MFIs’ primary objectives and promoting further development of the industry have been asserted as key elements in the literature pertaining to MFI performance. Similarly, several cases concerning poor governance have been analysed. Good corporate governance has become more important due to the demand for transparency and accountability of funds utilised in microfinance activities. Further, MFIs need to have a solid governance framework to minimise the possibilities of management failures which may jeopardise the efficacious application of received funds from governments and donors. In prior studies, the nature of corporate governance practised by MFIs is less understood and no substantive work using multiple MFI outcomes {{over a number of years}} has been <b>undertaken.</b> <b>The</b> <b>concerns</b> raised in reviews of individual MFIs and normative discussions of what should constitute best practice do point to the need for better understanding of the nature of corporate governance practised by the MFIs and also, to understand the nature of the relationship that exists between institutional success and corporate governance especially for developing countries.
