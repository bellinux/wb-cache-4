And up next, a movie long thought to be lost before it was rediscovered and presented at last year's TCM Classic Film Festival. From Citation Films in nineteen sixty — Private Property. Oates and Corey Allen play a couple of sketchy drifters named Duke and Boots. They're hitchhiking their way across Southern California — for a threatening version of George and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. They spy an attractive woman driving a Corvette. Duke and Boots follow her home, take up residence in the vacant house next door, with the intention of spying on her and then seducing her.|$|E
40|$|This thesis was an {{interesting}} project. It was an assignment that offered {{me the opportunity to}} do {{one of the most difficult}} things I have ever done to date. There was a handful of individuals who consistently supported me throughout this roller coaster of a ride they call grad school. It would not be right if I did not attempt to name every one of them. The following people made the past year and half possible, because without them, there were so many opportunities that I would have forgotten to eat, sleep and most importantly shower. Thanks to the Paul, Glenn, and Kevin for giving me the opportunity to learn so much in PRIME Lab and always forgiving me when I said I was not applying for a doctoral program. Paul, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> giving me a sneak peak at all the mad scientist gear and introducing me to world of curiosity. Glenn <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> letting me <b>join</b> your doctoral class and bearing with me as I stumbled through Advanced Quant. I learned so much and every day I felt my brain stretching to the max. Kevin, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> starting both my strategic communication experiences off right, for undergrad and grad school, with data and theory...|$|R
50|$|During this tenure, at {{the section}} of the ride {{immediately}} following the crocodile scene, the driver would notice that while the vehicle is back on solid ground, there are no green poles. Confused, the driver asked the navigator which way to go, since the path split into left and right roads. Regardless of which path the navigator chose, the driver always went to the left. The right path was used only when the water portion of the ride was down or {{in case of an emergency}} situation. After turning left, the driver drives into a rain forest, then the truck reaches a bridge beside a huge waterfall, which becomes too powerful and breaks the bridge apart with the truck on it. The truck then proceeds to float down a river on a piece of the bridge. The driver gets upset at the navigator and quickly radios Rescue ONE to come get them. The truck then passes under another waterfall. This one happens to soak guests in the back row. Soon, the driver finds Rescue ONE stuck due to a broken bridge. As the truck reaches the broken bridge, the current pulls it in and it stops just in time before plummeting down a waterfall. Thinking quickly, the driver notices a pathway in front of them, and tells guests to hope that it leads to safety. Shortly after, the truck reaches the finish line and wins the race, as victory music plays loudly. The driver <b>thanks</b> guests <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> them as they exit the truck.|$|R

40|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> {{us again}} in this our latest issue (V/ 1) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has turned 5 {{years old with}} this issue. We are {{extremely}} delighted and proud to see the seeds we planted {{in the autumn of}} 2010 take root and grow. Social studies as a system of scientific research, and an academic career, is relatively new to Turkey, so achieving this success here means even more compared to in other countries with more deeply rooted traditions and a greater accumulation of knowledge in this area. Therefore I am grateful to everyone who contributed to achieving this success over the last four years. JSSER {{is a member of the}} Association for Social Studies Educators (ASSE). From ASSE’s perspective JSSER‘s role is to provide a basis for social studies academicians to fulfill their national and wider responsibilities and mission by contributing to the advancement of the social science research and to the sharing of research results. The second contribution of the JSSER in this area was to set up and institutionalize an International Symposium on Social Studies Education. Last month we held the third such symposium. Every year we bring together hundreds of native and foreign scientists, teachers and students in these symposiums, which have gained the status of a scientific banquet. Among our medium term targets is the advancement of these two activities in quality and quantity...|$|E
40|$|Hello, <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> {{us again}} in this November 2014 issue (V/ 2) of Journal of Social Studies Education Research (JSSER). Our journal has {{completed}} its 5 years with this current issue. As {{the family of}} Association of Social Studies Educators (ASSE), we are extremely delighted and proud to see the blossoms that we first watered in 2009. JSSER has turned to a qualified electronic journal that has been acknowledged and indexed by various indexes in recent years. One of those indexes has been recognized by Turkish Higher Education Council as a database that includes periodicals regarded as publishing quality academic papers that fulfills the requirements for applying associate professorship. Since its foundation, ASSE, {{the publisher of the}} JSSER has been playing the role of an instrument to manifest and improve the “New Social Studies Movement” which emerged through the end of 1990 s. The mission of JSSER in this context is to meet the requirement for academic periodical, publishing studies on social studies education. Being published as an electronic journal, JSSER gives us an opportunity to take advantages of the so called Information Age. As a matter of fact, today’s electronic journals have a potential to reach more readers than most of the best-selling published periodicals of late 20 th Century. Nevertheless, the same technologies present some risks that we cannot keep under control. The problems that the have been experiencing in the preparation processes of the last two issues are in this kind. In this issue, we have also experienced some communication problems as result of the moving of JSSER’s technical substructure to the Turkish Journal Park. As a result, only three papers, whose peer-reviewing processes had completed could be published in this current issue: Rishabh Kumar Mishra “Social Constructivism and Teaching of Social Science”, Hatice Türe and Arife Figen Ersoy “Sosyal Bilgiler Öğretmenlerinin Hoşgörü Algısı” (Social Studies Teachers’ Perceptions of Tolerance) and Feryal Çubukçu “Values Education Through Literary Texts”. These valuable papers have potential to contribute the literature on social studies education. One of the main aims of ASSE was to establish a regular scientific event through which social studies educators from Turkey and abroad get together to share their academic works and ideas. In conjunction with the Faculty of Education of Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University we are organizing the Fourth International Symposium on Social Studies Education (ISSE) in April 2015. The main theme of ISSE the 4 th is “Peace Education”. The preference of this theme emphasizes on our hopes and determination for our envision for peace in the late Ottoman geography, in which guns have still been on fire and people have still been shedding tears. And this could be regarded as something similar to the action of Mustafa Kemal Pasha who thought of about the reconstruction of the country after the war and assembled an “Educational Congress” in Ankara to discuss educational issues, during the most difficult days of the War of Independence in 1921. Adopting this approach, we have been considering putting effort to institutionalize the values of democracy, human rights, justice, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience. As a final remark, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the production of this issue and special thanks to Assoc. Prof. Dr. Erkan Dinç who acted as issue editor. Best regards and hope to meet you in ISSE the 4 th...|$|E
50|$|On the journey, Ferdie throws Rosie's cat out of {{the window}} by {{accident}} whilst sneezing as he is allergic; so to keep her unaware, he retrieves the dead cat and pretends that it is sleeping. The group visit Fanny's old house and find a deranged Russian man Vladmir Olianov (Mihai Fusu), who eventually tells them that Fanny sold him the house 20 years ago and moved to Tivoli. During the trip, Ferdie tells Savio that Rosie's husband is not dead, but instead had run away to Madagascar with another woman, and Rosie had simply lied to the village for the sake of her pride. As they approach Tivoli, Ferdie <b>thanks</b> everyone <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> him on his journey - but unbeknownst to him, most of the other passengers have their own reasons for making the trip. Savio soon realizes that they have gone the wrong way, and are now in the state of Karnataka due to wrong navigation by Ferdie, who cannot read a map. When they run out of petrol, Ferdie volunteers to go and get some in the morning; so the group spend the night in the open field next to the road. Don Pedro tries to seduce Rosie into being a model for his painting, whilst Savio and Angie go away from the others to talk. Savio tells Angie that he does not have a big business in Mumbai as presumed, but rather he was a waiter for 5 years and is not wealthy. It is revealed that Angie only married Gabo because Savio never asked her, and {{she was in love with}} Savio as he was with her. He kisses her and she slaps him. They eventually talk and after realizing that they both still have feelings for each other, have sex that night.|$|R
