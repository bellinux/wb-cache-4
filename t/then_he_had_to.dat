5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E

Since <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave his family and live by himself as the school is in Beijing, which is thousands of kilometers away from his hometown. As the only kid, this was a huge decision to both him and his family. Although painful, he survived loneliness and tough training in the school. Later, he continued with his bachelor of Chinese classical dance at Beijing Dance Academy, one of the best dance institutions in China.|$|E

25|$|Thursday's Task: If Eric {{had won the}} HoH {{competition}} on Thursday night {{then he would have}} automatically completed the Nomination Task. In this case the top vote getting in CBS's AP poll would have been nominated along with a second player of Eric's choosing on Friday night, and Eric's task would have been complete. When Eric did not win the HoH competition, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> convince the HoH to nominate the AP poll winner on Friday; however, if the HoH did not put up the player Eric/America was targeting on Friday, then Eric had a second chance to complete this task at the Veto Ceremony. Eric completed all but the last of his nomination tasks.|$|E
25|$|On {{their final}} {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} second quarter, Tyrone Prothro made {{one of the most}} memorable receptions in Alabama history. On a fourth-and-twelve, Croyle threw a 42-yard pass that Prothro caught on the back of Golden Eagles cornerback Jasper Faulk. Prothro had to wrap his right arm around Faulk's neck and his left arm under Faulk's right armpit to catch the ball (which appeared on replays to be blocked from his view by Faulk), and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> maintain possession of the ball until his knee touched down at the one-yard line. Referred to as simply The Catch, the play won the 2006 Best Play ESPY Award. The Crimson Tide then cut the lead on the following play to 21–17 just before the half after Croyle connected with Le'Ron McClain on a one-yard touchdown reception.|$|E
25|$|Ulster's {{geography}} {{presented a}} formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, {{and all three}} favoured the defenders. Brian first {{had to find a}} means of getting through or around these defensive 'choke points', and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.|$|E

500|$|In 1969, King again {{tried and}} failed to {{circumnavigate}} in Galway Blazer II. In 1970, he was ready for another attempt, again using Galway Blazer II. Ill-health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about [...] southwest of Fremantle. [...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, [...] "barely able to limp into port".|$|E

2500|$|Although they {{attended}} school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They {{were not allowed}} to sit inside the class.

His talents were on display during the negotiations for the Patent's Amendment Bill in early 2005. The Congress was committed to passing an IP bill, but their allies in the United Progressive Alliance from the Left front had a long tradition of opposing some of the monopoly aspects of intellectual property. Pranab Mukherjee, as Defence Minister, was not formally involved but was roped in for his negotiation skills. He drew on many old alliances including the CPI-M leader Jyoti Basu (former Chief Minister of West Bengal), and formed new intermediary positions, which included product patent and little else. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> convince his own colleagues including commerce minister Kamal Nath, at one point saying: ...|$|E
