5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by <b>the</b> <b>proxy</b> members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011.

50|$|Proxy Chaining is {{possible}} in RADIUS and authentication/authorization and accounting packets are usually routed between a NAS Device and a Home server {{through a series of}} proxies.

Hence, the trust factor among <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> gains more significance under such Inter-domain applications.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the situation in}} which there are multiple proxies for one unobserved explanatory variable in a linear regression and provide a procedure by which the coefficient of interest can be extracted "post hoc" from a multiple regression in which all <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> are used simultaneously. This post hoc estimator is strictly superior in large samples to coefficients derived using any index or linear combination of <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> that is created prior to the regression. To use an index created from <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> that extracts <b>the</b> largest possible signal from them requires knowledge of information that is not available to the researcher. Using <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> simultaneously in a multiple regression delivers this information, and the researcher then simply combines the coefficients in a known way to obtain the estimate of the effect of the unobserved factor. This procedure is also much more robust than ad hoc index construction to departures from the assumption of an underlying common factor. We provide some Monte Carlo simulations and applications to existing empirical problems to show that the reduction in attenuation bias can be non-negligible, even in finite samples.

25|$|Additionally, {{selecting}} {{for improvement}} in the assayed function simply generates improvements in the assayed function.

Improvement of the assayed activity can be due to improvements in enzyme catalytic activity or enzyme concentration. There is also no guarantee that improvement on one substrate will improve activity on another. This is particularly important when the desired activity cannot be directly screened or selected for and so a ‘proxy’ substrate is used. DE can lead to evolutionary specialisation to <b>the</b> <b>proxy</b> without improving the desired activity. Consequently, choosing appropriate screening or selection conditions is vital for successful DE.|$|E

40|$|Proxies for {{estimating}} nucleation {{mode number}} concentrations and further simplification {{for their use}} with satellite data have been presented in Kulmala et al. (2011). In this paper we discuss the underlying assumptions for these simplifications and evaluate <b>the</b> resulting <b>proxies</b> over an area in South Africa based on a comparison with a suite of ground-based measurements available from four different stations. <b>The</b> <b>proxies</b> are formulated in terms of sources (concentrations of precursor gases (NO 2 and SO 2) and UVB radiation intensity near the surface) and a sink term related to removal of the precursor gases due to condensation on pre-existing aerosols. A-Train satellite data are used as input to compute <b>proxies.</b> Both <b>the</b> input data and <b>the</b> resulting <b>proxies</b> are compared with those obtained from ground-based measurements. In particular, a detailed study is presented on the substitution of the local condensation sink (CS) with satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is a column-integrated parameter. One of the main factors affecting the disagreement between CS and AOD {{is the presence of}} elevated aerosol layers. Overall, <b>the</b> correlation between <b>proxies</b> calculated from <b>the</b> in situ data and observed nucleation mode particle number concentrations (N nuc) remained low. At the time of the satellite overpass (13 : 00 – 14 : 00 LT) the highest correlation is observed for SO 2 /CS (R 2 = 0. 2). However, when <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> are calculated using satellite data, only NO 2 /AOD showed some correlation with N nuc (R 2 = 0. 2). This {{can be explained by the}} relatively high uncertainties related especially to the satellite SO 2 columns and by the positive correlation that is observed between the ground-based SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. In fact, results show that the satellite NO 2 columns compare better with in situ SO 2 concentration than the satellite SO 2 column. Despite the high uncertainties related to <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> calculated using satellite data, <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> calculated from <b>the</b> in situ data did not better predict N nuc. Hence, overall improvements in the formulation of <b>the</b> <b>proxies</b> are needed...|$|R
