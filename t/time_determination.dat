The observatory, which was located at 51° 34' 34" [...] N latitude and 0h 0.87m W longitude (equivalent to just under 0.250), was equipped with a 7 ¹/₄ inch (184mm) aperture equatorial telescope made by Thomas Cooke & Sons of York in 1854. The telescope was exchanged for a 10-inch (254mm) aperture 12 feet (3.66m) focal length instrument in 1860 by the same maker, which was fitted with a three-inch (76mm) aperture finder telescope. The observatory was also equipped with a transit telescope by Troughton & Simms for <b>time</b> <b>determination.</b> The acquisition of the second, larger, telescope persuaded Barclay {{that it would be}} necessary to have a professional astronomer to work the observatory for him, and the services of Hermann Romberg (1835-1898) were obtained. In 1864, after only two years work, Romberg moved to the Berlin Observatory and was replaced by Charles George Talmage (1840-1886). Talmage suffered from poor health and his death in his mid-forties in 1886 brought an end to regular observational work at Leyton. Barclay died just two years after Talmage and the telescope was bequeathed to the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford. The transit telescope was separately bequeathed to the Oxford University Observatory. When the Radcliffe left the UK for the better skies of Southern Africa in the nineteen-thirties the Cooke telescope stayed in behind and was installed at Marlborough College Observatory.|$|E
5000|$|The schematism of {{the pure}} {{understanding}} is [...] "the sensuous condition time under which alone pure {{concepts of the}} understanding Categories can be used." [...] Categories, or pure concepts of the understanding, are abstract representations of objects in general. However, they can result in thought about particular, specific internal or external objects if they are related to time. All concepts are derived from perceptions, therefore pure concepts Categories are based on pure perceptions. The purest perception, or schema, is time. Time has the purest relation to sensation that is possible. It is the mere form of sensation because sensations must be felt in succession. Therefore, time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept. All things are experienced in time, that is, in succession, one after another. This applies to our internal selves {{as well as to}} all external objects. Since categories are the forms through which every specific thing can be thought as being in time, categories are related to time. Thus, pure concepts, or categories, and phenomenal objects share time as a common feature. Therefore, time is the means by which an intuited phenomenon is subsumed under a pure concept. Schemata are transcendental time determinations. [...] "Hence it will be possible for the category to be applied to appearances by means of the transcendental <b>time</b> <b>determination,</b> which, as the schema of the concepts of the understanding, mediates the subsumption of appearances under the category." ...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic Emission (AE) is a {{promising}} non-destructive monitoring technique {{to investigate the}} damage location and to evaluate the structural health conditions. Based on the tests performed on a masonry bridge, three ingredients ï€­sensor distribution, onset <b>time</b> <b>determination</b> and degree of inhomogeneityï€­ affecting the accuracy of AE localization are discussed. The test result shows a reasonable sensor arrangement is of great importance for the localization capability. The highest accuracy can be achieved for damage sources localized among the sensor distributions. Distances of sources far from the sensor network are less accurate. Onset <b>time</b> <b>determination</b> of an AE signal is another important factor in this technique. A widely used approach, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), is confirmed to provide more reliable onset <b>time</b> <b>determination</b> of AE signals. Moreover, the inhomogeneity of the test object may lead to errors in the ultrasonic wave travelling model. Different-scale fluctuations and structure variations in the composite structure can result in random variations of the propagation velocity and systematic errors.

The culture medium was White's supplemented with either sucrose, glucose, fructose or 1 : 1 glucose : fructose (G:F) all at 2 % (w/v) but no added plant growth regulators.

40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent {{comparison}} of the rise times for low – and high–redshift Type Ia supernovae. Following previous studies, the early light curve is modeled using a t 2 law, which is then mated with a modified Leibundgut template light curve. The bestfit t 2 law is determined for ensemble samples of low – and high–redshift supernovae by fitting simultaneously for all light curve parameters for all supernovae in each sample. Our method fully accounts for the non-negligible covariance amongst the light curve fitting parameters, which previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to Riess et al. (1999 a), we find fair to good agreement between the rise times of the low – and high– redshift Type Ia supernovae. The uncertainty in the rise time of the high-redshift Type Ia supernovae is presently quite large (roughly ± 1. 2 days statistical), making any search for evidence of evolution based on a comparison of rise times premature. Furthermore, systematic effects on rise <b>time</b> <b>determinations</b> from the high-redshift observations, due to {{the form of the}} late-time light curve {{and the manner in which}} the light curves of these supernovae were sampled, can bias the high-redshift rise <b>time</b> <b>determinations</b> by days under extreme situations.
