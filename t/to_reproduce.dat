5|$|Around {{three-quarters of}} chicks {{live long enough}} to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> The maximum {{recorded}} age is 27 years and 5 months for a Dutch bird.|$|E
5|$|Chaparral {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> The rare Gentner's fritillary also grows in this region.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese company Norinco {{has made}} an effort <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> this firearm. The Norinco 97 is an almost exact copy of the Winchester 1897, {{produced}} in both Trench and Riot grades, yet lacking in the fit and finish of the originals.|$|E

50|$|Sharp {{focus is}} {{fundamental}} <b>to</b> <b>reproducing</b> a realistic, appealing image, and a viewer's attention is automatically drawn to sharper areas. When done correctly, good pulling goes mostly unnoticed by the audience.|$|R

5|$|The Nord Stage 2 {{also has}} the ability to play samples, {{allowing}} it <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> the functionality of a Mellotron or Chamberlin. Individual samples can be downloaded from Clavia's website, and a community has developed that provides new instruments and sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} mural {{was completed}} on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced {{the construction of}} a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> the mural, which was completed in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E
5000|$|If {{literature}} {{is a particular}} form by means of which objective reality is reflected, then it becomes of crucial importance for it to grasp that reality as it truly is, and not merely to confine itself <b>to</b> <b>reproducing</b> whatever manifests itself immediately and on the surface.

50|$|Sibelius's main {{function}} is to help create, edit and print musical scores. It supports virtually all music notations, enabling even the most complex of scores (such as modern orchestral music) <b>to</b> be <b>reproduced</b> <b>to</b> publication quality.|$|R

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> {{the sound of}} the original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} requiem sharks, the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the empty yolk sac develops into a placental connection {{through which the}} mother provides nourishment. Off the United States, males are thought <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> every year, while females reproduce every other year.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they can spread rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|E

40|$|We present {{calculations}} of {{the intensity of}} polariton-mediated inelastic light scattering in semiconductor microcavities within a Green's function framework. In addition <b>to</b> <b>reproducing</b> the strong coupling of light and matter, this method also enables the inclusion of damping mechanisms in a consistent way. Our results show excellent agreement with recent Raman scattering experiments. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
5|$|Blunt-Lytton {{documented}} her {{attempts in}} the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel {{as seen in the}} portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> the earlier style.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger {{that he might}} be able <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps, (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly dependent on their fig species in order <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa Stem Nematode (ASN) is {{a nearly}} {{microscopic}} round worm that enters the alfalfa plant {{and lives in}} the stems and leaves, usually above ground.

40|$|Standard {{business}} cycle models face difficulties generating (i) government spending multipliers exceeding unity and (ii) stabilizing effects of government size.

50|$|The Reproducibility Initiative is {{a service}} {{allowing}} life scientists {{to pay to}} have their work validated by an independent lab. In October 2013 the initiative received funding to review 50 of the highest-impact cancer findings published between 2010 and 2012. Blog Syn is a website run by graduate students that is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>reproducing</b> chemical reactions reported in papers.|$|R
5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of electrical and mechanical advantages, plus {{the absence of}} magnetic yoke high-frequency losses, make them especially suitable <b>to</b> <b>reproducing</b> frequencies up <b>to</b> 50 kHz. Technics (Matsuhita Electric) marketed a line of strain-gauge (labeled [...] "semiconductor") cartridges especially intended for Compatible Discrete 4 quadraphonic records, requiring such high frequency response. Bass response down to 0 Hz is possible.|$|R
