5|$|Psilocybin is a <b>tryptamine</b> {{compound}} with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), <b>tryptamine</b> (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
25|$|Tryptophan is the {{starting}} material in the biosynthetic pathway of reserpine, and is converted to <b>tryptamine</b> by tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme. <b>Tryptamine</b> is combined with secologanin {{in the presence of}} strictosidine synthetase enzyme and yields strictosidine.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{interactions between the}} novel psychoactive <b>tryptamines</b> DiPT, 4 -OH-DiPT, 4 -OH-MET, 5 -MeO-AMT, and 5 -MeO-MiPT at monoamine receptors and transporters compared with the classic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline. We investigated binding affinities at human monoamine receptors and determined functional serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptor activation. Binding at and the inhibition of human monoamine uptake transporters and transporter-mediated monoamine release were also determined. All of the novel <b>tryptamines</b> interacted with 5 -HT 2 A receptors and were partial or full 5 -HT 2 A agonists. Binding affinity to the 5 -HT 2 A receptor was lower {{for all of the}} <b>tryptamines,</b> including psilocin and DMT, compared with LSD and correlated with the reported psychoactive doses in humans. Several <b>tryptamines,</b> including psilocin, DMT, DiPT, 4 -OH-DiPT, and 4 -OH-MET, interacted with the serotonin transporter and partially the norepinephrine transporter, similar to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine but in contrast to LSD and mescaline. LSD but not the <b>tryptamines</b> interacted with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In conclusion, the receptor interaction profiles of the <b>tryptamines</b> predict hallucinogenic effects that are similar to classic serotonergic hallucinogens but also MDMA-like psychoactive properties...|$|R
40|$|New psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) are not {{tested for}} their cytochrome P 450 (CYP) inhibition potential before consumption. Therefore, this potential was explored for tryptamine-derived NPS (TDNPS) including alpha-methyl <b>tryptamines</b> (AMTs), dimethyl <b>tryptamines</b> (DMTs), diallyl <b>tryptamines</b> (DALTs), and diisopropyl <b>tryptamines</b> (DiPTs) using test substrates preferred by the Food and Drug Administration in a cocktail assay. All tested TDNPS {{with the exception}} of DMT inhibited CYP 2 D 6 activity with IC 50 values below 100 μM. DALTs inhibited CYP 2 D 6 activity similar to paroxetine and quinidine and CYP 1 A 2 activity comparable to fluvoxamine. 5 -Methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine reduced in vivo the caffeine metabolism in rats consistent with in vitro results. Five of the AMTs also inhibited CYP 1 A 2 activity comparable to amiodarone. AMT and 6 -F-AMT inhibited CYP 2 A 6 activity in the range of the test inhibitor tranylcypromine. CYP 2 B 6 activity was inhibited by 19 <b>tryptamines,</b> but weakly compared to efavirenz. CYP 2 C 8 activity was inhibited by five of the tested TDNPS and three showed values comparable to trimethoprim and gemfibrozil. Six <b>tryptamines</b> inhibited CYP 2 C 9 and seven CYP 2 C 19 activities comparable to fluconazole and chloramphenicol, respectively. Nineteen compounds showed inhibition of CYP 2 E 1 and 18 of CYP 3 A activity, respectively. These results showed that the CYP inhibition by TDNPS might be clinically relevant, but clinical studies are needed to explore this further...|$|R

25|$|Dimethyltryptamine is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is <b>tryptamine.</b> <b>Tryptamine</b> then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to <b>tryptamine.</b> This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. <b>Tryptamine</b> transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E

25|$|Indole {{undergoes}} electrophilic substitution, mainly {{at position}} 3 (see diagram in right margin). Substituted indoles are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic precursors for) the tryptophan-derived <b>tryptamine</b> alkaloids like the neurotransmitter serotonin, and melatonin. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone auxin (indolyl-3-acetic acid, IAA), tryptophol, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin, the betablocker pindolol, and the naturally occurring hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine.|$|E
25|$|Before {{techniques}} of molecular biology {{were used to}} localize indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like <b>tryptamine</b> are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays {{are not required to}} be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT (see DMT subsection below). The essentially qualitative method thin layer chromatography (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies. Also, robust evidence that INMT can catalyze transmethylation of <b>tryptamine</b> into NMT and DMT could be provided with reverse isotope dilution analysis coupled to mass spectrometry for rabbit and human lung during the early 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Examples of SNDRAs include {{specific}} amphetamines such as MDMA, MDA, 4-methylamphetamine, methamphetamine (in high doses), certain substituted benzofurans such as 5-APB and 6-APB, naphthylisopropylamine; cathinones such as mephedrone and methylone; <b>tryptamines</b> such as αMT and αET; {{along with}} agents of other chemical classes such as 4,4'-DMAR, and 5-IAI. αET and αMT are of special notability among SNDRAs in that those <b>tryptamines</b> were once used as pharmaceutical drugs, specifically as antidepressants, but were withdrawn shortly after introduction in the 1960s due to problems with toxicity and recreational use. Such <b>tryptamines</b> were originally thought {{to act as}} monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) before the signature monoamine-releasing actions were elucidated. Many years after being withdrawn, αET was also determined to produce serotonergic neurotoxicity, similarly to MDMA and various other SNDRAs; the same is very likely true for αMT as well, although it has not specifically been assessed.|$|R
500|$|Many {{cases of}} {{serotonin}} toxicity occur {{in patients who}} have ingested drug combinations that synergistically increase synaptic serotonin. It may also occur as a symptom of overdose of a single serotonergic agent. The combination of MAOIs with precursors such as L-tryptophan or 5-HTP pose a particularly acute risk of life-threatening serotonin syndrome. The case of combination of MAOIs with <b>tryptamine</b> agonists (commonly known as ayahuasca) can present similar dangers as their combination with precursors, but this phenomenon has been described in general terms as the [...] "cheese effect".
