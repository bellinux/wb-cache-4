He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> face, Hal angrily storms out.

Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E

25|$|On 12 May 2002, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church canonized schema monk Amphilochius (Amfilohiy) of Pochayiv. Amphilochius of Pochayiv (in world Yakiv Holovatyuk 1894 - 1971) {{was born}} on November 27, 1894 in the village Mala Ilovytsya, in Shumsk raion of Ternopil oblast in western Ukraine. In 1925 he became a monk and joined the {{community}} of Pochayiv Lavra. In 1936, Amphilochius {{had been given the}} rank of hieromonk (priest-monk). His healing gifts attracted the attention of many people. Archimandrite of Lavra blessed the monk in this work and allowed him to settle in a little hut near the cemetery. In the summers, the pilgrimage to Amphilochius (then called father Joseph) was increasing, reaching 500 people daily. On the 11 / 12 May 2002, he was canonized by the Orthodox Church after the church commission researched his life. Just before Easter his relics were uncovered fully intact. Over 20.000 Orthodox pilgrims arrived {{to take part in the}} veneration of Saint Amphilochius. Many healings took place when people come <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> relics.|$|E

500|$|As a {{very private}} man, Longfellow did not often add autobiographical {{elements}} to his poetry. Two notable exceptions are dedicated {{to the death of}} members of his family. [...] "Resignation" [...] was written {{as a response to the}} death of his daughter Fanny in 1848; it does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning. The death of his second wife Frances, as biographer Charles Calhoun wrote, deeply affected Longfellow personally but [...] "seemed not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> poetry, at least directly". His memorial poem to her was the sonnet [...] "The Cross of Snow" [...] and was not published in his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|By May 1941, Sinatra {{topped the}} male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines. His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls {{of that time}} were called, {{revealed}} a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as [...] "Sinatramania" [...] after his [...] "legendary opening" [...] at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, [...] "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion... All this for a fellow I never heard of." [...] Sinatra performed for four weeks at the theatre, his act following the Benny Goodman orchestra, after which his contract was renewed for another four weeks by Bob Weitman due to his popularity. He became known as [...] "Swoonatra" [...] or [...] "The Voice", and his fans [...] "Sinatratics". They organized meetings and sent masses of letters of adoration, {{and within a few}} weeks of the show, some 1000 Sinatra fan clubs had been reported across the US. Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, encouraged interviews and photographs with fans, and was the man responsible for depicting Sinatra as a vulnerable, shy, Italian–American with a rough childhood who made good. When Sinatra returned to the Paramount in October 1944 only 250 persons left the first show, and 35,000 fans left outside caused a near riot, known as the Columbus Day Riot, outside the venue because they were not allowed in. [...] Such was the bobby-soxer devotion to Sinatra that they were known to write Sinatra's song titles on their clothing, bribe hotel maids for an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> bed, and accost his person in the form of stealing clothing he was wearing, most commonly his bow-tie.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{two centuries}} after his death. Donnelly remains {{the subject of}} urban legend.

Another claims that he was knighted by the Prince Regent. His arms were {{actually}} of normal length for a man of his size. [...] No known documentation exists to support the latter.|$|E

2500|$|Notes: Kirkman liked Cable's {{paramilitary}} {{look from}} his comic book {{appearances in the}} 1990s, so he made it his goal to have Cable [...] "use every piece of equipment hanging off of him." [...] However, he chose to change Cable's history. [...] In the mainstream Marvel universe, Cable is the time-displaced son of Cyclops. In this story arc, Kirkman has Cable reveal himself to be Wolverine's future self, although without his healing ability. Cable is also somehow able <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> past self and not be eaten by the Time Spiders introduced in the [...] "President Thor" [...] story arc of Ultimate Fantastic Four.|$|E
2500|$|Liberace once stated, [...] "I don't give concerts, I {{put on a}} show." [...] Unlike {{the concerts}} of {{classical}} pianists which normally ended with applause and a retreat off-stage, Liberace's shows ended with the public invited on-stage <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> clothes, piano, jewelry, and hands. Kisses, handshakes, hugs, and caresses usually followed. A critic summed up his appeal {{near the end of}} Liberace's life: [...] "Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rajiv Gandhi's last {{public meeting}} was on 21 May 1991, at Sriperumbudur, a village {{approximately}} [...] from Madras, {{where he was}} assassinated while campaigning for the Sriperumbudur Lok Sabha Congress candidate. At 10:10pm, a woman later identified as Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, approached Gandhi in public and greeted him. She then bent down <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> feet and detonated a belt laden with [...] of RDX explosives tucked under her dress. The explosion killed Gandhi, Rajaratnam, and at least 25 other people. The assassination was captured by a 21-year-old local photographer, whose camera and film were found at the site. The cameraman, named Haribabu, died in the blast but the camera remained intact. Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for post-mortem, reconstruction and embalming.|$|E
2500|$|The Arts of War {{consists}} of two statue groups, Valor and Sacrifice. Both are in a style of Art Deco known as [...] "Delayed Deco". Facing Arlington Memorial Bridge from the District of Columbia, Valor {{is on the left}} and Sacrifice is on the right. Valor {{consists of}} a bearded, muscular male nude symbolic of Mars, the ancient Roman god of war. To his left is a semi-nude female striding forward, a shield attached to her left, trailing forearm. Sacrifice shows the same figures, but in different poses. The nude male now holds a small child in his arms, his head bowed. The semi-nude female is to his right, her back to him and the horse. But her head is turned backward to look at the rider, her right arm reaching up <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> right elbow.|$|E
2500|$|The {{modus operandi}} of [...] "The Pocket Man" [...] {{was the same}} in all known cases: The {{perpetrator}} tricked young boys <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> genitals, for instance by tricking them to [...] "search for" [...] a key in his pocket, where he had removed or cut {{a hole in the}} lining, or to adjust a bandage on his thigh. The more serious offenses he is alleged to have committed include oral sex, which in some cases borders on the Norwegian criminal code's definition of rape. The police allege that [...] "The Pocket Man" [...] on several occasions forced the boys to perform oral sex on him. Oral sex is equated with intercourse in the Norwegian penal code and, if performed under coercion, has an upper limit of 21 years in prison, the maximum sentencing in Norway. The police have later stated that the most serious case has an upper limit of 15 years.|$|E
