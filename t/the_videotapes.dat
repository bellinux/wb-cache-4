Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of hand, so he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: www. bps. org. ukThis paper {{describes}} two experiments which investigate how believers in the paranormal (labelled 'Sheep') and disbelievers (labelled 'Goats') recall different aspects of pseudo-psychic demonstrations (i. e., conjuring tricks that can be misinterpreted as genuine psychic phenomena). In both experiments Ss were first shown a videotape containing pseudo-psychic trickery. They {{were then asked to}} rate the 'paranormal' content of <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> and complete a set of recall questions. Ss were then told that <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> contained magic tricks, and asked to complete a second set of recall questions. The recall questions contained information both 'important' and 'unimportant' to the method of the tricks. Overall, the results suggested that (i) Sheep displayed a slight tendency to rate the demonstrations as more 'paranormal' than Goats, (ii) initially Goats tended to recall significantly more 'important' information than Sheep and that, (iii) even when told that <b>the</b> <b>videotape</b> contained trickery, Goats tended to recall more 'important' information than Sheep (but only after Sheep had lost access to 'surface' memory for <b>the</b> <b>videotape).</b> Suggestions for improved methodology are given, along with proposals for future work in this area...|$|R
2500|$|Debate {{is ongoing}} among some {{scientists}} (such as David Premack), about non-human great apes' {{ability to learn}} language. Since the early reports on Washoe, numerous other studies have been conducted, with varying levels of success, including one involving a chimpanzee named jokingly Nim Chimpsky, trained by Herbert Terrace of Columbia University. Although his initial reports were quite positive, in November 1979, Terrace and his team, including psycholinguist Thomas Bever, re-evaluated <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> of Nim with his trainers, analyzing them frame by frame for signs, {{as well as for}} exact context (what was happening both before and after Nim's signs). In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting {{on the part of the}} experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. [...] "Much of the apes' behaviour is pure drill," [...] he said. [...] "Language still stands as an important definition of the human species." [...] In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human language acquisition. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did. More importantly, Nim's word strings varied in their ordering, suggesting that he was incapable of syntax. Nim's sentences also did not grow in length, unlike human children whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final report}} of the {{commission}} was tabled in the Assembly on 18 May 2000. The report indicted the police by stating [...] "the lapse {{on the part of}} the police personnel, deputed for surveillance and checks, in discharging their duties more vigorously, vigilantly and intelligently". It also quoted that [...] "for surveillance and checks, had been more vigilant before the bomb blasts, the tragic incidents... could have been averted". The report stated that several state and central vigilance warnings were discarded by the city police. The report concluded that the Muslim fundamentalist organisation Al Ummah, based in Tamil Nadu, hatched a conspiracy to [...] "avenge" [...] the killings of 18 Muslims during earlier riots. The report quoted that three human bombs named Amanuallah, Melapalayam Amjath Ali and Rafique alias Shanmugam, were targeting L.K. Advani, but could not penetrate the security cardon. The investigations found that the group used <b>the</b> <b>videotapes</b> of the deceased during the riots to mobilise sympathy and garner financial support from Muslim countries, mainly those comprising the Gulf. The report made several recommendations like deploying checkposts in sensitive areas, proscribing organisations acting against law, setting up separate intelligence wing and methods to evaluate feedback of lower level police officers. The government accepted the commission's findings in principle and stated that specific recommendations would be examined in detail by the respective departments before passing orders.|$|E
2500|$|A 1987 {{study at}} Indiana University Bloomington used 14 Mechanical Universe episodes {{as part of}} an {{introductory}} course on Newtonian mechanics, with generally positive results:hese tapes were particularly effective in placing Newtonian mechanics in a historical perspective; dramatizing the historical overthrow of Aristotelian and medieval ideas; illustrating the diverse nature of scientists and the scientific endeavor; stimulating student interest and enthusiasm; and, through excellent animation, illustrating the time dimension of certain mechanics concepts. The companion text [...] was placed on library reserve for the course but was not extensively utilized by students.A follow-up study found that the videos could also be helpful explaining physics to professors in other fields. Negative reactions generally had less to do with the intrinsic perceived quality of the episodes than with the time the science-history material took away from content seen as [...] "critical exam-preparing instruction".

To counter this tendency I started to use a few test questions based on historical or literary details discussed in <b>the</b> <b>videotapes.</b> Some students were outraged: [...] "What is this, a poetry class?"A 2005 column in The Physics Teacher suggested The Mechanical Universe as preparatory viewing for instructors attempting to teach physics for the first time.
