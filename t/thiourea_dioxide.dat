40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: {{studying}} the physico-chemical properties, methods of synthesis {{and analysis of the}} thiourea oxides, to be used as the high-effective regenerators in the organic and non-organic synthesis and in the different enterprises of chemical technology. The new methods of the synthesis and analysis of the thioureas oxides have been developed. The constants of the tautomer balance and the constants of the acidic dissociation in the water and water-dimethylsulphoxide solutions have been determined. The stability of the <b>thioureas</b> <b>dioxides</b> and the ability to the generation of the ion-radicals SO* 002 in the non-water solutions have been determined. The kinetic laws of reactions of the n-benzoquinone with di- and trioxides of thiourea, and with hydroxymethansulphinate and hydroxymethansulphonate of natrium, have been established. On the example of reaction with bromide of octaphenyltetraasaporphyrinate of iron (III), the perspectiveness of application of the dioxide of phenylthiourea as the regenerator in the nonwater media has been shown. The obtained results are necessary for understanding and systematization of mechanisms of redox-reactions of the sulphur-oxygen compounds, for the development of methods of the purposeful regulation of its regeneration activity and creation of chemical oscillators on the base of the sulphur-oxygen compoundsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5000|$|The {{complementary}} base is the sulfoxylate anion SO22− {{which is}} much more stable. In between these states is the SO2H− ion, also somewhat stable. Sulfoxylate ions can be made by decomposing <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> in an alkaline solution. To do this, <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> first forms a tautomer, aminoiminomethanesulfinic acid (H2NC(=NH)SO2H, abbreviated AIMS) which breaks apart. Sulfoxylate reacts with formaldehyde to yield a hydroxymethane sulfinate called rongalite: SO2H− [...] + H2CO → HOCH2SO2− which is an importance chemical for dyeing.|$|E
50|$|Discharge {{agents are}} used to bleach color from previously-dyed fabrics, {{and can be used}} in a sort of reverse tie-dye. Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can be used to {{discharge}} fiber reactive dyes on bleach-resistant fibers such as cotton or hemp (but not on wool or silk), though the results are variable, as some fiber reactive dyes are more resistant to bleach than others. It is important to bleach only as long as required to obtain the desired shade, and to neutralize the bleach with agents such as sodium bisulfite, to prevent damage to the fibers. <b>Thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> is another commonly used discharge agent that can be used on cotton, wool, or silk. A <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> discharge bath is made with hot water is made mildly basic with sodium carbonate. The results of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> discharge differ significantly from bleach discharge. Discharge techniques, particularly using household bleach, are a readily accessible way to tie-dye without use of often messy and relatively expensive dyes.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a simple, well-studied sulfinic acid is phenylsulfinic acid. A commercially {{important}} sulfinic acid is <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide,</b> which is prepared by the oxidation of thiourea with hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of the oxidation has been examined. An aqueous solution of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> has a pH about 6.5 at which <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> is hydrolyzed to urea and sulfoxylic acid. It {{has been found that}} at pH values of less than 2, thiourea and hydrogen peroxide react to form a disulfide species. It is therefore convenient to keep the pH between 3 and 5 and the temperature below 10 °C. [...] It can also be prepared by oxidation of thiourea with chlorine dioxide. [...] The quality of the product can be assessed by titration with indigo.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{is related to}} that for thiourea. The N2CS core is approximately planar, but the sulfur is pyramidal. Selected bond lengths: S-C = 1.85, C-N = 1.31, and S-O = 1.49 Å.|$|E
50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts.|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{dithionite}} and <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> are two typical reducing agents {{commonly used}} in industry. This paper compared the thermal hazards of sodium dithionite and <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> based on DSC-TG (Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetry) thermal analysis, small-scale self-heating experiments and FTIR smoke gas analysis. From the thermal analysis (DSC-TG), sodium dithionite starts to lose crystal water at the temperature around 60 °C which makes the sodium dithionite very unstable at relatively lower temperature. The decomposition of sodium dithionite has a close correlation with oxygen while the decomposition of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> has little relationship with oxygen. Small-scale self-heating experiments were designed to reflect the self-heating and spontaneous combustion properties of the characteristic dimension 20 cm. The small-scale self-heating experiments {{show that there is}} a little gap between the Critical Ambient Temperature (CAT) of sodium dithionite and <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide.</b> From FTIR smoke gas analysis, the smoke of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> (decomposition or combustion) is far more dangerous than sodium dithionite. Although the risk of spontaneous combustion for sodium dithionite is higher than <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide,</b> the thermal hazards of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> are far higher than sodium dithionite as the decomposition and combustion of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> would release far more heat and dangerous smokes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{was used}} in {{chemical}} modification studies to identify functionally important amino acids in Escherichia coli CTP synthetase. Incubation at pH 8. 0 {{in the absence of}} substrates led to rapid, time dependent, and irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The second-order rate constant for inactivation was 0. 18 M- 1 s- 1. Inactivation also occurred in the absence of oxygen and in the presence of catalase, thereby ruling out mixed-function oxidation/reduction as the mode of amino acid modification. Saturating concentrations of the substrates ATP and UTP, and the allosteric activator GTP prevented inactivation by <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide,</b> whereas saturating concentrations of glutamine (a substrate) did not. The concentration dependence of nucleotide protection revealed cooperative behavior with respect to individual nucleotides and with respect to various combinations of nucleotides. Mixtures of nucleotides afforded greater protection against inactivation than single nucleotides alone, and a combination of the substrates ATP and UTP provided the most protection. The Hill coefficient for nucleotide protection was approximately 2 for ATP, UTP, and GTP. In the presence of 1 : 1 ratios of ATP:UTP, ATP:GTP, and UTP:GTP, the Hill coefficient was approximately 4 in each case. Fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements indicated that modification by <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> causes detectable changes {{in the structure of the}} protein. Modification with [14 C]thiourea dioxide demonstrated that complete inactivation correlates with incorporation of 3 mol of [14 C]thiourea dioxide per mole of CTP synthetase monomer. The specificity of <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> for lysine residues indicates that one or more lysines are most likely involved in CTP synthetase activity. The data further indicate that nucleotide binding prevents access to these functionally important residues...|$|E

40|$|This work evaluates a novel bitumen {{modification}} {{through the}} use of a chemical agent, <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide,</b> substance which has been traditionally used as a reducing agent. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated the formation of new chemical compounds, most probably originated through reactions between products from <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> thermal decomposition and some highly polar bitumen molecules. As a result of these reactions, which continues even after 60 days, bitumen permanent deformation resistance at high temperature is enhanced, as indicated by a significant increase in its viscosity and elastic features. On the other hand, <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> addition produces changes in the bitumen colloidal nature, which improve its flexibility at low in-service temperatures, and consequently its resistance to thermal cracking under loading. In fact, dynamic bending tests indicated a remarkable decrease in the value of binder glass transition temperature, which was further corroborated by differential scanning calorimetry. As a conclusion, <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> can be seen as a promising modifiying agent, which can extend the in-service temperature range at which bitumen would present a satisfactory performance.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{spectra of}} chemically treated and weathered paper made from stone-ground wood pulp (SGWP) and thin sections of wood {{treated in a}} similar manner have been recorded. Very little difference was found between the paper and wood samples. Chemical treatment included reduction with sodium borohydride and photochemical bleaching with <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The samples were subjected to photobleaching of the fluorescent chromophores, and the wood samples and paper exhibited a photochromic effect. Of particular significance was the observation that borohydride-reduced and thiourea-dioxide-photobleached wood perform differently in the photobleaching experiments from their paper counterparts. These differences are attributed to the mechanochemistry which occurs during pulping, producing species such as stilbenes which are present in the paper but not in the wood. When borohydride-reduced SGWP and wood are weathered, much of the short-wavelength fluorescence is lost and an increase in longer wavelength emission is observed. Reduction by borohydride of the weathered samples leads to partial recovery of the shorter wavelength fluorescence. These observations are interpreted as being due to photoreactions of 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxycinnamyl alcohol residues...|$|E

In that sense, two non-polymeric additives, thiourea and <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide,</b> {{along with a}} reactive isocyanate-terminated prepolymer have been evaluated. Viscous flow and linear viscoelasticity tests, at 60 ºC, reveal bituminous modified binders which evolve towards highly viscous materials when subjected to ambient curing. However, at 135 ºC, they show lower viscosity than a typical 3 wt. % SBS binder used as reference. These results suggest modified binders with low viscosity which may contribute to reduce the mix asphalt temperature.

40|$|Textile {{discharge}} printing {{is the most}} versatile and important of {{the methods used for}} introducing design to textile fabrics. In discharge styles, the pattern is produced by the chemical destruction of the original dye in the printed areas. The discharging agents used can be oxidising or reducing agents, acids, alkalis and various salts. However, the most important methods of discharging are based formaldehyde sulphoxylates and <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Recently, environmental and industrial safety concerns have increased the potential for the use of enzymes in textile processing to ensure eco-friendly production.

40|$|Indigo is {{insoluble}} {{in water}} and most dyeing solvents. Hence, its use in textile coloration is achieved by alkaline reduction to a soluble leuco-compound and then applying this solution followed by oxidation. Printing with indigo on cotton commonly employs sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) as the alkali and sodium hydrosulphite (hydros) as the reducing agent. Caustic soda poses effluent disposal problems. Hydros rapidly loses potency by reacting with atmospheric oxygen during the printing / padding process. This causes premature oxidation of print paste and necessitates constant monitoring. Further, the degradation products of hydros pose effluent hazards. Hence, {{there is a constant}} search to find better alternatives in terms of chemical stability and effluent management. In the above context, the present research used <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> (TUD) as a more stable reducing agent and sodium carbonate as a milder alkali. The resulting effect on printing cotton fabric with both natural and synthetic indigo has been evaluated. The shades obtained using synthetic indigo were about 20 % darker than those obtained using natural indigo. When caustic soda was used as the alkali, a steaming time of 60 seconds was found to be ideal, for both natural and synthetic indigo. However, when sodium carbonate was used darkest shades were obtained at steaming times of 2 and 6 minutes for natural and synthetic indigo respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings from}} investigations into adapting the padding process for dyeing cotton and wool using natural dyes. The aim was to apply traditional dyes employing current and emerging technologies of textile colouration. This synergistic amalgamation led to a cleaner production process with low environmental impact. Mordant dyes (derived from Acacia catechu and Acacia nilotica) and vat dyes (Indigofera tinctoria) were evaluated. The work on mordant dyes focused on determining optimal process parameters (padding sequence, mordanting method and mordant concentration). Post-mordanting with copper (II) sulfate or iron (II) sulphate yielded the darkest shades for both dyes. Ideal process sequence for copper (II) sulfate was pad (dye) → dry → steam followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry while for iron (II) sulfate it was pad (dye) → steam → dry followed by pad (mordant) → steam → dry for both dyes. Similarly, use of the first mordant yielded a beige shade while a yellow-grey shade was obtained with the second. Optimum mordant concentration for 10 g/l dye was 15 g/l copper (II) sulfate or 5 g/l iron (II) sulphate for both dyes. These were lower than those recommended for exhaust dyeing (5 % OWM) and padding (60 g/l) reported in the literature. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed higher amount of metal in the dyed fabric compared to identically mordanted fabric, confirming {{the formation of a}} dye-metal-textile complex. FTIR spectra were distinctly different for the two dyes investigated. However, the spectra for dyed samples, coloured using the above dyes in combination with the same mordant, exhibited minimal differences. This indicated that metal {{plays a major role in}} defining the bonds created during dye-metal-textile complex formation causing a similarity in shade. Darker shades were obtained by atmospheric pressure plasma pretreatment of the textile, or including chitosan in the pad liquor. Pure helium and a 95 / 5 helium/nitrogen mixture were evaluated as the plasma gas. Exposure to either plasma improved the wettability of wool. Wool treated in pure helium plasma for 14 seconds exhibited a 30 % increase in the depth of shade. A tone-on-tone pattern was created in a single padding operation by selective plasma pretreatment. Incorporation of 0. 05 % chitosan in the pad liquor resulted in a 20 % darker shade while imparting antimicrobial properties to the dyed fabric. Indigo was applied on cotton by the vat dyeing process of pad (dye) → dry → pad (reducing chemicals) → steam. In this process, sodium dithionite and sodium hydroxide, the common reducing agent and alkali in exhaust dyeing of indigo, were replaced by <b>thiourea</b> <b>dioxide</b> and sodium carbonate respectively. Although equivalent shades were obtained, the use of sodium carbonate required comparatively longer steaming time. Natural indigo produced a darker shade when reduced using the alternative chemicals perhaps due to its higher reactivity resulting from its lower crystallinity as compared to synthetic indigo. However, printing with synthetic indigo resulted in darker shades. The discrepancy between printing and dyeing may be attributed to interference by the print paste thickener on diffusion of reduced indigo into the fabric...|$|E
