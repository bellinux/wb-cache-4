5|$|Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks {{invisible}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, {{developed this}} method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.|$|E
25|$|Most {{inclusions}} {{present in}} gem-quality diamonds do {{not affect the}} diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close <b>to</b> or breaking <b>the</b> surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.|$|R
40|$|Eu-doped BaTiO 3 xerogel {{thin films}} of pseudo-cubic {{perovskite}} phase were successfully fabricated on MgO substrates {{by using a}} high concentration sol-gel process, in which a gel-aging process on substrate (GAPS) was employed. Strong photoluminescence in the xerogels is visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> under UV excitation at room temperature. Influences of europium concentration, hydrolysis and aging conditions on the photoluminescence were investigated quantitatively...|$|R
30|$|Curiosity {{and desire}} to see {{microscopic}} world have leaded {{the invention of the}} optical microscope. Thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> optical microscope, the small structures that had been invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> could be seen. Modern biology and medical science where large portions are based on the observation of micro-objects such as cells and bacteria have been developed with the advance in the optical microscope. With fluorescent materials, optical microscopes became more useful and essential for the decades, but there is still a fundamental question how <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> spatial resolution below diffraction limit.|$|R
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is not visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy {{is among the}} brightest of the Messier objects - making it visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of {{the stars in the}} Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
30|$|By {{the age of}} 35 days AH, F 2 hybrid TGGG {{entered the}} {{juvenile}} stage, as their morphological characteristics started to resemble those of an adult. The body is no longer transparent with slight pigmentation, and the lateral line can be seen clearly. The stomach {{was covered with a}} silver pouch, and was obvious <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> At this stage, caudal fins were well-developed, along with the dorsal and pelvic spines. Although juveniles are seen as more aggressive compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larval stage, they remain at the bottom, with less swimming activity. However, they performed speedy swimming, particularly when approaching food.|$|R
500|$|Since the {{mushroom}} is small, and fruits {{in only a}} limited season in a small area, researchers have investigated <b>the</b> conditions needed <b>to</b> artificially cultivate <b>the</b> species in laboratory conditions, {{in order to have}} more material <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> mechanism of bioluminescence, and <b>to</b> help preserve <b>the</b> species. The optimum temperature for the growth of mycelia is , while the optimum for the growth of primordia is [...] These temperatures are consistent with the subtropical climate in which the species is typically found. Maximum luminescence occurs at 27°C, and about 25–39hours after <b>the</b> primordia begin <b>to</b> form, when <b>the</b> cap has fully expanded. At 21°C, luminescence persists for about 3days, and becomes undetectable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> about 72hours after primordium initiation.|$|R
30|$|Endometriosis {{generally}} affects {{otherwise healthy}} young women with high expectations of well-being {{and quality of}} life. In this population, complications and side effects of surgery are not easily tolerated, and the recurrence of symptoms can be especially frustrating. It is doubtful that the primary surgery, however beautifully and skilfully performed, would remove all viable endometriotic ‘cells’ or microscopic endometriotic lesions invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> under <b>the</b> laparoscopy and eliminate recurrence altogether. Theoretically, just one single viable cell can, under suitable milieu and conditions, propagate and grow into a colony [8]. Conceivably, recurrence after surgery occurs because of in situ regrowth of residual endometriotic lesions or cells not completely removed in the surgery, growth of microscopic endometriosis undetected at surgery, or the development of de novo lesions, {{or a combination of}} these.|$|R
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> for {{twice as long as}} the previous record-holder. It was also brighter than magnitude0 for eightweeks, longer than any other recorded comet.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus {{reached its}} maximum {{apparent}} size in December 1882. The comet faded gradually, but despite its fragmentation it remained visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> until February 1883. The last definite sighting {{of the comet}} was made by B. A. Gould at Córdoba on 1 June 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Nevertheless, {{the prospect of a}} supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.|$|E

50|$|In a {{modern-time}} re-enactment of the Pasteur experiment, it {{was established}} that the preparation of crystals was not very reproducible. The crystals deformed, but they were large enough <b>to</b> inspect with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> (microscope not required).|$|R
25|$|M13, visible <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> and binoculars, is a {{globular}} cluster of the 6th magnitude that {{contains more than}} 300,000 stars and is 25,200 light-years from Earth. It is also very large, with an apparent diameter of over 0.25 degrees, {{half the size of}} the full moon; its physical diameter is more than 100 light-years. Individual stars in M13 are resolvable in a small amateur telescope.|$|R
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{in the night sky}} and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> The star's metal abundance is ten {{times higher than the}} Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The tan lines {{created by}} the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. A 1969 {{innovation}} of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.|$|E
50|$|The Vorlons {{were able}} to take a piece of {{hyperspace}} and fold it onto itself like a pocket {{and use it as a}} hiding place (anything inside the pocket is apparently almost invisible <b>to</b> sensors and <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye).</b>|$|R
50|$|Hunters {{commonly}} use binoculars in {{the field}} {{as a way to}} see game animals that are too far away <b>to</b> spot with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Hunters most commonly use 8x binoculars with light transmission and large enough objectives to gather light in low light conditions.|$|R
40|$|Depression is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by persistent occurrences of lower mood {{states in the}} affected person. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly complex, nonlinear, and nonstationary in nature. The characteristics of the signal vary with the age and mental state of the subject. The signs of abnormality may be invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> Even when they are visible, deciphering the minute changes indicating abnormality is tedious and time consuming for the clinicians. This paper presents a novel method for automated EEG-based diagnosis of depression using nonlinear methods: fractal dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis, Hurst's exponent, higher order spectra, and recurrence quantification analysis. A novel Depression Diagnosis Index (DDI) is presented through judicious combination of the nonlinear features. The DDI calculated automatically based on the EEG recordings {{can be used to}} diagnose depression objectively using just one numeric value. Also, these features extracted from nonlinear methods are ranked using the t value and fed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier yielded the highest classification performance with an average accuracy of about 98 %, sensitivity of about 97 %, and specificity of about 98. 5 %...|$|R
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
50|$|Clear-air {{turbulence}} {{is usually}} impossible <b>to</b> detect with <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> and {{very difficult to}} detect with a conventional radar, {{with the result that}} it is difficult for aircraft pilots to detect and avoid it. However, it can be remotely detected with instruments that can measure turbulence with optical techniques, such as scintillometers, Doppler LIDARs, or N-slit interferometers.|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the wave}} {{reflection}} from any damage in a structure, a Hilbert spectral analysis-based rapid multi-damage identification (HSA-RMDI) technique with piezoelectric wafer sensor arrays (PWSA) is developed to monitor and identify the presence, location and severity of damage in carbon fiber composite structures. The capability of the rapid multi-damage identification technique to extract and estimate hidden significant information from the collected data and to provide a high-resolution energy-time spectrum can be employed <b>to</b> successfully interpret <b>the</b> Lamb waves interactions with single/multiple damage. Nevertheless, <b>to</b> accomplish <b>the</b> precise positioning and effective quantification of multiple damage in a composite structure, two functional metrics from the RMDI technique are proposed and used in damage identification, which are the energy density metric and the energy time-phase shift metric. In the designed damage experimental tests, invisible damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> especially delaminations, were detected in the leftward propagating waves {{as well as in the}} selected sensor responses, where the time-phase shift spectra could locate the multiple damage whereas the energy density spectra were used <b>to</b> quantify <b>the</b> multiple damage. The increasing damage was shown to follow a linear trend calculated by the RMDI technique. All damage cases considered showed completely the developed RMDI technique potential as an effective online damage inspection and assessment tool...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue-induced {{damage is}} often {{progressive}} and gradual in nature. Fatigue is often deteriorated by corrosion in ageing structures, creating maintenance problems, and even causing catastrophic failure. This ushers {{the development of}} structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) systems. Recent advent of smart materials applicable in SHM alleviates the shortcomings of the conventional techniques. Autonomous, real-time, remote monitoring becomes possible {{with the use of}} smart piezoelectric transducers. For instance, the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique, employing piezoelectric transducers as collocated actuators and sensors, is known for its ability in damage detection and characterization. This article presents a series of lab-scale experimental tests and analysis <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> feasibility of fatigue crack detection and characterization employing the EMI technique. This study extends the work by Lim and Soh [1] <b>to</b> incorporate <b>the</b> phases involving crack initiation and critical crack. It is suggested that the EMI technique is effective in characterizing fatigue induced cracking, even in its incipient stage. Micro-crack invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> can be detected by the technique especially when employing the higher frequency range of 100 - 200 kHz. A quick and handy qualitative-based critical crack identification method is also suggested by visually inspecting the admittance frequency spectrum...|$|R
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|In early times, {{astronomy}} only {{comprised the}} observation and {{predictions of the}} motions of objects visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, {{an important factor in}} knowing when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion {{were only a few}} weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E

40|$|Every {{child is}} born a scientist, with curiosity <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> {{environment}} through experimentation. However, in practice, science education still very focuses on transmitting facts instead of encouraging personal exploration. Conducting science exploration in a classroom can be complicated for kids and limited by safety, money and laboratory infrastructure. But what if we could create a middle ground between science and fiction, a world where kids discover and experiment in ways that could be impossible in real life but still true to science? This project is to design an imaginative and accessible tool to help kids develop a scientific mindset and practice through play. Wonder-LAND is a mixed reality book system that empowers kids <b>to</b> discover <b>the</b> unseen and experiment the impossible through play. The system combines AR and VR technology with various traditional paper-based mechanisms from pop-up book, cut-out toys and movable cards to bring a world alive. In such way, kids can interact with the tangible material, paper, to unlock amazing 3 D virtual phenomena. They can discover {{things that are not}} visible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> through metaphorical paper tools. And they can also conduct experiments that are impossible in reality by creating their own universe and controlling parameters in simulation. And those playful interactions spark their curiosity and passion for more scientific exploration...|$|R
