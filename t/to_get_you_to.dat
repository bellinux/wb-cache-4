500|$|The Year Zero game {{consisted}} of an expansive series of websites, phone numbers, e-mails, videos, MP3s, murals, {{and other media}} that expanded upon the fictional storyline of the album. Each new piece of media contained various hints and clues to discover the next, relying on fan participation to discover each new facet of the expanding game. Rolling Stone described the fan involvement in this promotion as the [...] "marketing team's dream". Reznor, however, argued that [...] "marketing" [...] was an inaccurate description of the game, {{and that it was}} [...] "not some kind of gimmick <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> buy a record – it IS the art form".|$|E
500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pay for a MySpace-quality stream {{as a way to}} promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E

That though Jesus Christ hath {{done all}} these things for sinners, yet the devils make it their whole work, and {{continually}} study how they may keep thee and others from enjoying of these blessed privileges that have been thus obtained for sinners by this sweet Jesus. He labours, I say, (1.) <b>To</b> keep <b>thee</b> ignorant of thy state by nature. (2.) To harden thy heart against the ways of God. (3.) To inflame they heart with love to sin and the ways of darkness. And, (4.) <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> continue herein. For that is the way, he knows, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> be a partaker with him of flaming hell-fire, even the same that he himself is fallen into, together {{with the rest of}} the wicked world, by reason of sin. Look to it therefore.|$|R

500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about NYPD Blue. Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Josh Brolin {{discussed}} the Coens' directing style in an interview, {{saying that the}} brothers [...] "only really say {{what needs to be}} said. They don't sit there as directors and manipulate you and go into page after page to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a certain place. They may come in and say one word or two words, so that was nice to be around in order to feed the other thing. 'What should I do right now? I'll just watch Ethan go humming to himself and pacing. Maybe that's what I should do, too.|$|E
2500|$|Following this speech, the Illinois {{delegation}} (led by Jacob Arvey) {{announced that}} they would place Stevenson's name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if [...] "he would be embarrassed" [...] if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say that. Why should it embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected {{him because he was}} [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago." [...] Stevenson's 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.|$|E

2500|$|Rating {{it three}} out of four stars, Steve Jones of USA Today commented. [...] "the singer is in a sexy, fun-loving mood [...] While she overdoes the between-song interludes here, she never fails <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> move. When it comes to burning up a dance floor, she is still Ms. Jackson." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation," [...] commended the album as {{containing}} [...] "songs so baroquely sumptuous that they're virtually experimental." [...] Pareles added, [...] "Boudoir ballads undulate in torrid slow motion while Ms. Jackson moans like a phone-sex operator, and uptempo tunes hark back to disco, splice mock-operetta to hard rock or, in Better Days, conjure an easy-listening 1960's-pop apotheosis." [...] Her vocals were also praised, saying [...] "Countless overdubs of Ms. Jackson's voice turn her into an airborne choir; computer rhythms thump and sizzle." [...] He concluded saying the album [...] "isn't as immediately melodic as Ms. Jackson's previous albums, but it compensates for lost catchiness with unabashed strangeness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club {{argued that}} {{through the use of}} a spoken {{introduction}} and other exposition-filled dialogue, the film fails by [...] "baldly revealing up front everything that the novel is trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wonder about and to explore slowly". Youyoung Lee wrote in a December 2007 Entertainment Weekly that the film [...] "leaves out the gore", such as the book's ritualistic heart-eating that concludes the bear fight, [...] "to create family-friendlier fare". Lee also said that the film [...] "downplays the Magisterium's religious nature", but Robinson argued that the depiction of the Church in the film is as [...] "a hierarchical organization of formally robed, iconography-heavy priests who dictate and define morality for their followers, are based out of cathedrals, and decry teachings counter to theirs as 'heresy.'...doing ugly things to children under cover of secrecy". Robinson then asks, [...] "Who are most people going to think of besides the Catholic Church?" [...] The film gives more prominence to scenes showing the Magisterium officials' perspective than the novel. The novel rarely mentions explicitly the Magisterium's intentions, relying on the gossip of others, and the comments of Mrs. Coulter.|$|E
2500|$|Chrisman {{was working}} for the NHRA in late 1963 or early 1964 when Ford's Fran Hernandez gave a Mercury Comet to Chrisman. After Chrisman did not race it, Hernandez asked, [...] "What's going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> race that car?" [...] Chrisman responded he wanted a blower to be {{installed}} in the car. Chrisman went to a dealer, picked up the racecar, and brought it to Bill Stroppe's shop. The pair and their crew assembled the car. The car was debuted at the 1964 U.S. Nationals with Chrisman doing a burnout to half track. Chrisman toured the eastern half of the United States with the car though the end of the 1965 season. In 1966, he added a flip-up fiberglass body on the car, following a trend started by Don Nicholson and Eddie Schartman. Chrisman won his first race, at the Hot Rod Magazine Championships at Riverside Race, in the Exhibition Stock category. It is generally considered to be the first funny car to exceed [...] The car ran the quarter mile in 8.72 seconds at , beating Jungle Jim Liberman in the finals. On July 10, 1966 he set a class record at , only to have the engine blow up two weeks later at the Super Stock Magazine Nationals. The car burned to the ground.|$|E
