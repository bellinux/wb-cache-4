5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods to help <b>them</b> <b>learn</b> words. There {{is a relationship}} between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling.|$|E

At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting <b>them</b> <b>learn</b> by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe.

Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events.
