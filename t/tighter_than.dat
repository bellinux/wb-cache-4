5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{print of}} the Goražde Psalter is clean, clear, and easy to read. The text in red was printed first, {{followed}} by the text in black. The faces of the cast metal types used for its printing were designed {{in the manner of}} uncial Cyrillic of medieval Serbian manuscripts, with certain elements of cursive. Ordinary text is printed in black letters with the corpus size of 2.7millimetres. Their strokes have moderately varying widths; their ascenders and descenders are also of moderate sizes. In the first 136 leaves, a block of ten lines of text written in these letters is 74millimetres high, and there are usually 18 to 20, though occasionally 21, lines per page. In the other leaves, the ten-line block is 70millimetres high, with mostly 22 lines per page, and word spacing is <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> {{in the first part of}} the book. Somewhat larger letters, 5 to 6millimetres high, appear at the beginning of some sentences; they can be black or red. Headings and lines at the beginning of textual units are printed in red. Among the punctuation marks used in the book are the indexes and symbols in the form of a fish, horn, and quadruple dot.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

[...] The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage.

The 1992 film also marked one of only several film roles played by comedian Emo Philips which he also helped produce.

500|$|Of the {{aforementioned}} equipment, climbing shoes {{have the most}} direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes {{are designed to help}} the climber secure and maintain footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> other athletic footwear, and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations: High-top shoes, for example, provide better protection for the ankle, while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the [...] "toe box", can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs.|$|E

[...] Hot Press praised the band for their inventive musical arrangements, and said that [...] "Holy Wood is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." [...] Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they [...] "play <b>tighter</b> <b>than</b> [...] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort)... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the Limp Bizkits of the world." [...] The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of Rolling Stone commended him for [...] "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." [...] Billboard magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. Revolver editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: [...] "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics.
