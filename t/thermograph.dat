500|$|Today, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} modern methods for making clotted cream. The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on <b>thermograph</b> charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E
2500|$|A true daily mean {{could be}} {{obtained}} from a continuously-recording <b>thermograph.</b> [...] Commonly it is approximated by the mean of discrete readings (e.g. 24 hourly readings, four 6-hourly readings, etc.) or by {{the mean of the}} daily minimum and maximum readings (though the latter can result in mean temperatures up to 1°C cooler or warmer than the true mean, depending on the time of observation).|$|E
2500|$|Biofeedback {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of relaxation training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the [...] "body's (biological) current state". One of the most common biofeedback tests is the Electromyograph (EMG), which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the Electroencephalograph (EEG). Another test, called the <b>thermograph,</b> measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's sweat gland activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was [...] "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} regular thermal patterns over normal knee, ankle, and elbow joints and demonstrate how synovitis affecting these joints may {{be identified by}} alteration or loss of the thermal pattern.

No joint with clinical evidence of synovitis had a normal thermal pattern.

40|$|Spring hydrographs and <b>thermographs</b> are {{a direct}} {{reflection}} of all processes that occur within aquifer systems. Therefore, they contain significant information about the hydrogeological characteristics of such systems. This article analyses hydrographs and <b>thermographs</b> from four springs located {{in the foothills of}} the Mt. Biokovo massif in southern Croatia. These springs are recharged by carbonate aquifers. Monitoring of yields and groundwater temperatures, as well as analysing hydrograph recessions, daily discharge and rainfall time series and water temperature dynamics, facilitated the identification of the main properties of the aquifer system located in the hinterland of the individual springs. Significant differences in the recharge mechanisms of individual springs were determined to be a consequence of varying geological conditions, degree of karstification and conduit network characteristics.

50|$|Density slicing, a {{variation}} of pseudo color, divides an image into a few colored bands and is (among others) used {{in the analysis of}} remote sensing images. For density slicing the range of grayscale levels is divided into intervals, with each interval assigned to one of a few discrete colors - this is in contrast to pseudo color, which uses a continuous color scale. For example, in a grayscale thermal image the temperature values in the image can be split into bands of 2 °C, and each band represented by one color - as a result the temperature of one spot in the <b>thermograph</b> can be easier acquired by the user, because the discernible differences between the discrete colors are greater than those of images with continuous grayscale or continuous pseudo color.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{integrity}} and reliability of an adhesive joint in an automotive composite component, several non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methodologies are correlated to lap shear bond strengths. A glass-fabric-reinforced composite structure was bonded to a metallic structure with a two-part epoxy adhesive. Samples were subsequently cut and tested in shear, and flaws were found in some areas. This study aims to develop a reliable and portable NDE system for service-level adhesive inspection in the automotive industry. The results of the experimental investigation using several NDE methods are presented and discussed. Fiberglass-to-metal bonding is the ideal configuration for NDE via thermography using excitation with induction heating, due to the conductive metal and non-conductive glass-fiber-reinforced composites. Excitation can be either by a research-grade induction heater of highly defined frequency and intensity, or by a service-level heater, such as {{would be used for}} sealing windshields in a body shop.
