Unfortunately, these returns are not forthcoming, quite often because of inadequate communication of the benefit program to employees. This article pre-sents a model of benefit communication which is intended to describe the process as it typically occurs. It also discusses specific problems inherent in the communication process and suggests several directions for research in benefit communication. According to recent U. S.

40|$|This paper extends {{earlier work}} by {{updating}} {{the structure and}} policy parameters <b>of</b> <b>payroll</b> taxes in Canada. Drawing from a newly available dataset, it also reports trends on the level, growth and role of each component of these taxes in recent years. Finally, it compares Canadian payroll taxes {{to those of the}} world's leading developed countries. The following highlights the main findings. Payroll taxes in Canada have grown considerably since the early 1980 s, constituting an increasingly important source of revenues for both the federal and provincial governments. However, the rapid expansion observed in earlier years has in large part slowed down in the early 1990 s. Payroll tax revenues collected from employees and employers in the country have stabilized at around 5. 7 % of GDP or 14. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>total</b> federal and provincial government revenues since 1992; the effective total payroll tax rate has levelled off at around $ 12. 20 for every $ 100 of wages and salaries since 1994. The structure, level, growth, and role of each component <b>of</b> <b>payroll</b> taxes vary considerably from one province to another. Yet, EI premiums have remarkably been the largest component of these taxes in every province in both the 1980 s and the 1990 s, regardless of whether there are provincial payroll taxes; rising EI premiums have also consistently been the leading contributor to the expansion <b>of</b> <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> taxes during this period. Despite rapid growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, Canadian payroll taxes remain one of the lowest in the world's major developed economies. According to data compiled by the OECD, total payroll tax revenues in Canada amounted to 6. 0 % of GDP in 1996 [...] - that is 14 % lower than that of the United States (at 7. 0 % of GDP); the lowest in the G 7 nations; and the 9 th lowest among the 29 OECD member states.

50|$|The tax is revenue neutral, and its {{revenues}} are redistributed proportionally to companies {{and to the}} Swiss population. For example, if the population bears 60% of the tax burden, they will receive 60% of the redistribution. For companies, revenues will be redistributed to all companies, except those who chose to exempt themselves from the tax through the cap-and-trade program. The revenue {{is given to the}} companies in proportion to the <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> <b>of</b> their employees and is distributed through an AHV compensation fund (Federal Old Age and Survivors' Insurance) that pays the relevant amount of revenue to the company. The revenues from the tax that were paid by the Swiss population are redistributed equally to all Swiss residents through health insurance companies and a deduction on their insurance premium. In June 2009 the Swiss Parliament decided to allocate about one-third of the revenue from the carbon tax to a 10-year building program for climate-friendly building renovations. This program promotes building renovations, the use of renewable energies, the utilization of waste heat, and building engineering.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy (Department) uses {{contractors}} to operate its facilities and compensates contractor employees {{based on their}} skills, complexity of jobs, and work performance. Thirty-one of the Department`s major contractors reported a <b>total</b> <b>payroll</b> <b>of</b> $ 4. 3 billion and $ 4. 4 billion during 1994 and 1995, respectively. The 31 contractors also reported awarding salary increases of $ 18 million for 1994 and $ 200 million for 1995. The purpose of the audit was to review the process used to determine and approve the amount of salary increases for contractor employees. The specific audit objective {{was to determine whether}} salary increases received by contractor employees were in accordance with Departmental policies and procedures. The Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) requires that contractor salary actions be within specific limitations, supportable, and approved prior to incurrence of costs. In addition, the Secretary of Energy imposed a 1 year salary freeze on the merit portion of management and operating contractor employee salaries for each contractor`s Fiscal Year 1994 compensation year. However, a fund for promotions and adjustments was approved but limited to 0. 5 percent <b>of</b> <b>payroll</b> for the year. A review of eight major contractors showed that six complied with the Department`s policies on salary increases. The other two gave salary increases that were not always in accordance with Departmental policies. This resulted in both contractors not fully complying with the pay freeze in 1994 and exceeding their salary increase fund budgets in 1995. If these two contractors had implemented Department and contract requirements and contracting officers had properly performed their contract administrative responsibilities concerning salary increase funds, both contractors would have frozen salary increases and would not have exceeded their annual budgets...|$|R

40|$|Despite constituting {{the third}} most {{important}} source of revenue for Canadian governments, payroll taxes receive relatively little attention. This is particularly surprising on two counts: first, there are important controversies regarding the employment effects of these taxes and, second, payroll taxes have grown substantially over the last 30 years {{and are likely to}} continue to increase in the future. Payroll taxes rose from 2. 9 per cent <b>of</b> <b>total</b> government revenue in 1965 to 12. 9 per cent in 1993. As a share <b>of</b> <b>total</b> labour income, they increased from 1. 9 per cent in 1961 to 10. 3 per cent in 1992. Payments for the three major programs funded through payroll taxes — Unemployment Insurance, the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans, and provincial workers’ compensation — rose from 3. 6 per cent of GDP in 1985 to 5. 1 per cent in 1992. The goals of this article are to provide a comprehensive overview <b>of</b> <b>payroll</b> taxation, to consider its future direction, and to discuss its potential impacts. We begin by outlining the current state <b>of</b> <b>payroll</b> taxation in Canada, chronicling its recent growth as a revenue source.
