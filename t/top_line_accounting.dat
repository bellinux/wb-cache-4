40|$|Multi-frequency {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) study of p-type synthetic 2 H MoS 2 reveals a previously unreported signal of axial-symmetry [g// = 2. 032 (2); g⊥ = 2. 270 (2) ] characteristic for a hole-type center in MoS 2. It is identified as originating from N acceptor dopants, the N atoms substituting for S sites, with a density of ∼ 2. 3 x 1017 cm- 3, thus predominantly accounting for the p-type sample doping. For the applied magnetic field along the c-axis, the signal is mainly comprised of a 14 N hyperfine 1 : 1 : 1 triplet of splitting A// = 14. 7 ± 0. 2 G with, on <b>top,</b> a center <b>line</b> <b>accounting</b> for ∼ 26 % of the total signal intensity. The additional observation of a weak half-field signal (g = 3. 92) correlating with the main full-field Zeeman response points {{to the presence of}} spin S ≥ 1 N agglomerates. The overall signal properties indicate that only ∼ 74 % of the N acceptors occur as isolated decoupled dopants. Monitoring of the ESR signal intensity over a broad temperature range unveils the N dopant as a shallow acceptor of activation energy Ea = 45 ± 7 meV, thus well fit for stable substitutional p-type doping in MoS 2 -based novel nanoelectronic devices...|$|R
