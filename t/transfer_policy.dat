5|$|The {{start of}} the 2011–12 season saw an {{overhaul}} in the first team, with the sale of influential first team players Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and José Enrique {{during the summer and}} the elevation of Tim Krul as first choice goalkeeper and centre back Fabricio Coloccini as captain. Signings such as Yohan Cabaye, Italian international Davide Santon and Senegalese striker Demba Ba in cut-price deals saw Newcastle adopt a new <b>transfer</b> <b>policy,</b> one which would be met with success in the season. They went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten. before losing away to Manchester City. Another Senegalese striker, Papiss Cissé, joined in the January transfer window, and Newcastle had a strong second half of the season, eventually securing a place in the 2012–13 Europa League. Newcastle finished in fifth place, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards, captain Coloccini was named in the PFA Team of the Year, and Cissé won the Goal of the Season award for a goal against Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Wenger's {{preparations}} for the 2011–12 season were disrupted by player unrest. Though he insisted none of his top players would leave the club, Fàbregas eventually moved to Barcelona, while Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri joined Manchester City. Suspensions and injuries left Wenger fielding an understrength side against Manchester United on 29 August 2011; Arsenal were trounced 8–2, which represented their worst defeat in 115 years. Needing to address the squad's lack of depth, Wenger completed a series of deals {{in the final days}} of the summer transfer window. He mostly brought in experienced players, such as Yossi Benayoun on loan from Chelsea, Everton's Mikel Arteta and Germany international Per Mertesacker. By October, Arsenal had made their worst start to a season in 58 years, losing four of their opening seven matches. However, the team soon harmonised, and in the same month club captain Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 5–3. Despite another season of no silverware, Wenger guided Arsenal to third position in the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive campaign. Van Persie had scored 37 goals, in his first injury-free season for the club. He, however, grew disillusioned with Arsenal's <b>transfer</b> <b>policy,</b> and decided not to renew his contract, with one year remaining. When Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson learnt of the situation, he called Wenger to push through a deal and Van Persie agreed to join Manchester United in August 2012. The club purchased strikers Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski in anticipation of the sale.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{capital tax}} competition affects <b>transfer</b> and development <b>policies</b> {{in the presence}} of regional income disparity. In each country, development policies determine the number of rich (poor) regions that (do not) engage in production activities, while <b>transfer</b> <b>policies</b> redistribute income between rich and poor regions. The mix of <b>transfer</b> and development <b>policies</b> is inefficient under tax competition: conditional on the equilibrium tax rate, too much revenue is spent on development policies and too little on <b>transfer</b> <b>policies.</b> This analysis of the expenditure mix implies that development policies are used as a means of regional redistribution even if <b>transfer</b> <b>policies</b> are efficient instruments for this purpose. Moreover, it is shown that the overall level of public expenditure may be too high because of the possibility of over-development.

25|$|In 1970, severe mercury poisoning, called Ontario Minamata disease, was {{discovered}} among Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation and Wabaseemoong Independent Nations people, who lived near Dryden, Ontario. There was extensive mercury pollution caused by Dryden Chemicals Company's waste water effluent in the Wabigoon-English River system. Because local fish {{were no longer}} safe to eat, the Ontario provincial government closed the commercial fisheries run by the First Nation people and ordered them to stop eating local fish. Previously it had made {{up the majority of}} their diet. In addition to the acute mercury poisoning in northwestern Ontario, Aamjiwnaang First Nation people near Sarnia, Ontario, experienced a wide range of chemical effects, including severe mercury poisoning. They suffered low birth rates, skewed birth-gender ratio, and health effects among the population. This led to legislation and eventually the Indian Health <b>Transfer</b> <b>Policy</b> that provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by First Nations people, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on the concept of self-determination in health. Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's <b>transfer</b> <b>policy</b> in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson {{commented that}} it lacked balance and needed {{defensive}} players to solidfy the Arsenal team.

It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player.

2500|$|Economists have {{proposed}} a variety of solutions for addressing income inequality.

While before-tax income inequality is subject to market factors, after-tax income inequality can be directly affected by tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>policy.</b> U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed nations before taxes and transfers, but is among the worst after taxes and transfers.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} privatisation as a {{topic of}} particular significance to the transformation of state and state activity in most countries {{over the last two}} decades. It does this with reference to Thailand’s telecommunications arrangements in light of ideas about <b>policy</b> <b>transfers</b> and <b>policy</b> networks. These ideas have been well discussed and debated in recent years and are relevant to an analysis of privatisation initiatives in the area of telecommunications, just as they are in many other areas of public policy and management. The ideas and the privatisation developments to which they are related in the thesis have assumed even greater importance in an era of globalisation in which systems, policies, practrices and networks are internationalised while also domestically oriented. These matters are recognised as the discussion unfolds in the thesis. The thesis also considers the adequacy of existing theories of <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> in the light of Thailand’s telecommunications privatisation experience. This thesis provides grounding upon which contemporary telecommunications privatisation <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> issues can be contextualised and understood. This thesis refers to elements from <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> frameworks and a network perspective to examine <b>policy</b> <b>transfer.</b> Applying <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>policy</b> networking into a conceptual framework is a useful tool to explain the motivations of policy makers who engage in the <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> process, the type of <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> that takes place, and the different agents that enter or exit the policy arena. In addition to defining the key terms underpinning privatisation <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> and network analysis, this thesis has identified some of the key players, organisations and structures that propagate the telecommunications privatisation policy network. While the analysis of <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> has been examined at both the national and local levels, policy actors are increasingly enmeshed in privatisation transfer processes and relationships that extend across national borders, and the network metaphor neatly encapsulates relationships and transfers that are both national and international in scope. Despite a burgeoning literature on cross-national <b>policy</b> <b>transfer,</b> there have been few of any systematic case studies to identify problems or complications in the practice of <b>policy</b> <b>transfer.</b> The process of privatisation needs {{to take into account the}} interplay of various historical, political, economic, legal, cultural and social elements. The thesis therefore used a broad perspective covering the range of factors, actors, conditions and circumstances that have facilitated or inhibited the development and eventual privatisation of SOEs in the telecommunications sector. This thesis then sets forth a model of privatisation <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> in Thailand taking into account the interaction among domestic and international actors. This simple model, far from being static, has been developed to capture the dynamic and complex network of interrelationships in <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> involving international and domestic stakeholders. Telecommunications privatisation <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> to Thailand highlights the constant interactions among multiple stakeholders, both domestic and international, during the privatisation <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> process. The thesis, although focuses on a developing country-Thailand- and on a specific sector, the conclusions drawn can be generally applicable to <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> whether undertaken in developed or developing countries. The thesis discovers that <b>policy</b> <b>transfer</b> emerges as a complex, non-linear process. To understand this process, the thesis traces the elements that have both driven and inhibited privatisation, thereby revealing the unique aspects confronting Thailand in its move to transform the ownership structures practices and policy frameworks inherited from the past. As will be argued, political instability and disagreements over policy frameworks and transparency have effected privatisation, and hence the ultimate outcomes of the telecommunications privatisation process in Thailand remain uneven and unclear...|$|R
