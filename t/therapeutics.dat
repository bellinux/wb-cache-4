5|$|Morpholinos are in {{development}} as pharmaceutical <b>therapeutics</b> targeted against pathogenic organisms such as bacteria or viruses and genetic diseases. The Morpholino drug eteplirsen from Sarepta <b>Therapeutics</b> received accelerated {{approval from the}} US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of some mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|Antiprion {{antibodies}} {{capable of}} crossing the blood-brain-barrier and targeting cytosolic prion protein (an otherwise major obstacle in prion <b>therapeutics)</b> have been described.|$|E
5|$|Morpholino oligos were {{conceived}} by Summerton (Gene Tools) at AntiVirals Inc. (now Sarepta <b>Therapeutics)</b> and originally developed {{in collaboration with}} Weller.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cialis {{generated}} $971million in sales, leading Icos to post its first-ever quarterly {{profit in}} August. In May 2009, tadalafil, {{to be sold}} as Adcirca by United <b>Therapeutics,</b> was approved in the United States {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension based on data from a pivotal study begun before the sale of Icos to Eli Lilly.|$|E
5|$|After college, Conway took a {{postdoctoral}} {{appointment in}} Chicago, later {{working as a}} contractor for the Food and Drug Administration, a researcher for Bionetics, a medicinal chemist for Avid <b>Therapeutics</b> (March 1995 – August 1997) and researcher for Message Pharmaceuticals (August 1997 – April 1999). He {{spent two years in}} organ distribution at the National Disease Research Interchange, and was subsequently employed by crop protection company Cerexagri as a regulatory chemist from May 2001 to June 2007, when he became a principal chemist for West Pharmaceutical Services. As of July 2013, he was working for a group near Raleigh, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for <b>therapeutics</b> purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as <b>therapeutics</b> in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel <b>therapeutics</b> for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new <b>therapeutics</b> to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
