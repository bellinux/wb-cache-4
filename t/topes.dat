5|$|The {{precursor}} to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula, with a maximum of 7.09inches (18cm) in Lázaro Cárdenas, Quintana Roo. The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba, peaking at 12.4inches (31.5cm) in <b>Topes</b> de Collantes. In Victoria de Las Tunas, a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses. Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred just {{two months after the}} Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers. The depression killed seven people in the country with another five missing, as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island. After the storm passed, the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense, while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism {{spread across}} ancient India and state support by various {{regional}} regimes {{continued through the}} 1st millennium BCE. The consolidation of monastic organisation made Buddhism the centre of religious and intellectual life in India. Pushyamitra, the first ruler of the Shunga Dynasty built great Buddhist <b>topes</b> at Sanchi in 188 BCE. The succeeding Kanva Dynasty had four Buddhist Kanva Kings.|$|E
25|$|The earlier Buddhist constructions {{have proved}} more durable than the Islamic period buildings. The Top-Rustam is 46 m (50 yd) in {{diameter}} {{at the base}} and 27 m (30 yd) at the top, circular and about 15 m (50ft) high. Four circular vaults are sunk in the interior and four passages have been pierced below from the outside, which probably lead to them. The base of the building is constructed of sun-dried bricks about 60cm (2ft) square and 100 to 130mm (4 or 5 in) thick. The Takht-e Rustam is wedge-shaped in plan with uneven sides. It is apparently built of pisé mud (i.e. mud mixed with straw and puddled). It is possible that in these ruins we may recognize the Nava Vihara described by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang. There are the remains of many other <b>topes</b> (or stupas) in the neighbourhood.|$|E

In the early to mid-1960s, popular culture was starting to be taken more seriously by the heavier newspapers; some claim that Private Eye considered this approach pretentious and ripe for ridicule, although others argue that the magazine was in fact covering popular culture before {{some of the more}} serious newspapers. This section also provided an outlet for satirical comment on popular musicians, whose antics were usually attributed to the fictional pop group [...] "The Turds" [...] and their charismatic leader [...] "Spiggy Topes". <b>Topes</b> and the Turds were originally based on The Beatles and a thinly disguised John Lennon, but the names were eventually applied to any rock star or band whose excesses featured in the popular press. (Although {{at the same time there}} was a real group called The Thyrds who appeared in the final of ITV's Ready, Steady, Win! competition.) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{its latest}} {{neurotoxicity}} guidelines {{released by the}} US EPA Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) in 1998, {{it is recommended that}} in a neurobehavioral testing, at a minimum, for acute studies, observations and activity testing should be made before the initiation of exposure, at the estimated <b>TOPE</b> (time of peak effects) within 8 hrs of dosing, and at 7 and 14 days after dosing. It is recommended that estimation of <b>TOPE</b> be made by dosing pairs of rats across a range of doses and making regular observations of gait and arousal. However {{it is well known that}} <b>TOPE</b> may vary with end points or exposure conditions. In order to derive quantitative safety measures such as the benchmark doses (BMD), dose-time-response modeling must be done first and a model-based estimate is then implied. In many cases, the overall BMD corresponds to a <b>TOPE</b> estimate. In such cases a substantial variation in the <b>TOPE</b> estimate in turn may result in substantial variation in BMD estimate. Therefore a reliable statistical estimate of <b>TOPE</b> is crucial to the correct determination of BMD. We therefore performed simulation studies to assess the impact of the experiment-based <b>TOPE</b> on the statistical estimation of the true <b>TOPE</b> on the basis of a fitted dose-time-response model. The simulation allows for the determination of the optimal timing range for the 2 nd testing. The results indicated that given only four repeated observations, the optimal second testing time was at about midway between time zero and the true <b>TOPE.</b> Choosing the second testing time at the <b>TOPE</b> may not generate statistical estimates closer to the true <b>TOPE...</b>|$|R
