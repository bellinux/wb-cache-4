5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> with Alfvén.|$|E
2500|$|In her film, [...] "Reassemblage: From <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> to the screen", Trinh T. Minh-ha {{comments}} on the ethnocentric bias that the colonizers eye applies to the naked female form. [...] Minha argues that this bias causes the nude female body {{to be seen as}} inherently sexually provocative, promiscuous and pornographic within the context of European or western culture.|$|E
60|$|Lilly did not answer. It {{was not yet}} seven o'clock, but the sky was dark. Aaron sat in <b>the</b> <b>firelight.</b> Even the {{saucepan}} on {{the fire}} was silent. Darkness, silence, <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> in the upper room, {{and the two men}} together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come often," [...] said Anne and Gilbert. They {{had risen}} and stood {{together}} in <b>the</b> <b>firelight's</b> glow. Leslie looked at them--youthful, hopeful, happy, typifying {{all she had}} missed and must forever miss. The light went out of her face and eyes; the girl vanished; it was the sorrowful, cheated woman who answered the invitation almost coldly and got herself away with a pitiful haste.|$|R
60|$|The leaping savages, <b>the</b> {{flickering}} <b>firelight</b> playing {{upon their}} painted bodies, circled about the victim at the stake.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of <b>the</b> voting, <b>Firelight</b> was <b>the</b> winner of the competition with the song [...] "Coming Home".|$|R
60|$|This {{time the}} Colonel scored certainly. <b>The</b> <b>firelight</b> saved Virginia.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>firelight</b> leaped {{suddenly}} on to Mr. Stone's thin yellow hand.|$|E
60|$|Margharita {{sipped her}} tea quietly, {{and made no}} reply; but in <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> her dark eyes glowed softly and brightly, and Lady St. Maurice was quite {{satisfied}} with her silence. For a few moments neither of them spoke. Then Lady St. Maurice {{leaned back in her}} chair, away from <b>the</b> <b>firelight,</b> and asked a question.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> cheerful <b>firelight</b> {{dispersed}} in {{some measure}} Lady Constantine's anxieties. 'If we only had something to eat!' she said.|$|R
60|$|Erlito hesitated--not so Reist. He stepped forward, and <b>the</b> leaping <b>firelight</b> threw {{a strange}} glow upon his pale, mobile features.|$|R
60|$|The big Indian {{drew back}} with another grunt, and <b>the</b> distant <b>firelight</b> flashed on {{his eyes as}} on {{polished}} black flints.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn colored and {{her eyes}} sparkled, and then <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> left her face.|$|E
60|$|She {{never looked}} up, and never spoke, <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> playing over her {{motionless}} figure.|$|E
60|$|Blake {{laid down}} his pipe and leaned forward, where <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> flickered on his face.|$|E
60|$|He was not tired {{when he got}} near home, or He did {{not know}} it. Across the field he could see <b>the</b> red <b>firelight</b> leaping in her bedroom window.|$|R
60|$|There were {{reasons why}} Nasmyth was stirred {{by what he}} had heard, and with his pipe he pointed to Mattawa, as <b>the</b> {{flickering}} <b>firelight</b> fell upon <b>the</b> old axeman's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is this woman?" [...] {{asked the}} great warrior; for, haggard {{as she was}} with travel, exhaustion, and the terror of her haunted loneliness, {{he did not know}} her in <b>the</b> {{uncertain}} <b>firelight.</b>|$|R
60|$|So they sat, by <b>the</b> <b>firelight,</b> in the silence, one on {{each side}} of the hearth.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>firelight</b> showed to Joan a comically frightened face, with round, staring {{eyes and}} an open mouth.|$|E
60|$|And Carquinez, in <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> {{a veritable}} Mephistopheles in velvet jacket, fixed {{me with his}} black eyes.|$|E
60|$|Clarke's eyes twinkled, {{but it was}} {{not with}} {{wholesome}} humour. They were keen, but he looked old and forbidding as he sat with the smoke blowing about him and <b>the</b> ruddy <b>firelight</b> on his face.|$|R
60|$|The {{wound was}} {{bleeding}} afresh. Her face had grown pale, and under her black scowling brows her eyes shone {{as if with}} <b>the</b> reflected <b>firelight.</b> But {{it was only the}} old implacable anger flashing out again.|$|R
500|$|The {{process of}} {{destroying}} the tally sticks began at dawn on 16 October and continued throughout the day; two Irish labourers, Joshua Cross and Patrick Furlong, were assigned the task. Weobley checked {{in on the}} men throughout the day, claiming subsequently that, on his visits, both furnace doors were open, which allowed the two labourers to watch the flames, while the piles of sticks in both furnaces were only ever [...] high. Another witness to the events, Richard Reynolds, <b>the</b> <b>firelighter</b> in <b>the</b> Lords, later {{reported that he had}} seen Cross and Furlong throwing handfuls of tallies onto the fire—an accusation they both denied.|$|R
60|$|D'Arnot saw a clean-limbed young giant {{emerge from}} the shadows into <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> and come quickly toward him.|$|E
60|$|The young man, {{whose face}} was stained by <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> the colour of pale cheese, made no answer.|$|E
60|$|But him {{you shall}} see, if <b>the</b> <b>firelight</b> be not too dim, as he {{responds}} to the Judge's call.|$|E
60|$|He {{took off}} his boots quietly and crept upstairs. His mothers door was wide open, because she slept alone still. <b>The</b> red <b>firelight</b> dashed its glow on the landing. Soft as a shadow, he peeped in her doorway.|$|R
60|$|Edwards, the butler, entered {{with the}} lamp. The room looked peculiarly cheery now, with the {{delicate}} white panelling {{of the wall}} glowing under the soft kiss of <b>the</b> flickering <b>firelight</b> and <b>the</b> steadier glow of the rose-shaded lamp.|$|R
60|$|He sat on by <b>the</b> cheerful <b>firelight</b> {{thrown from}} {{a bundle of}} green ash-sticks laid across the dogs; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends. When she came back she was herself again.|$|R
60|$|Philippa, {{slim and}} elflike in <b>the</b> <b>firelight,</b> {{rose from her}} chair. There was a {{momentary}} cruelty in her face.|$|E
60|$|He stood up, leaning {{a little}} upon his stick, the dull, green stone of which flashed brightly in <b>the</b> <b>firelight.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tetaheite's good-humoured visage was glistening in <b>the</b> <b>firelight,</b> {{the mouth}} {{expanded}} {{from ear to}} ear, and the eyes almost closed.|$|E
60|$|Late one evening, {{a little}} time onward, he caught her sitting by <b>the</b> dim <b>firelight</b> in her room. She did not know he had entered; and he found her weeping. 'What are you crying about, poor dearest?' he said.|$|R
6000|$|It was Adrea--Adrea herself! She {{stood there}} {{in the shadow of the}} doorway, with her lips {{slightly}} parted, and her great eyes, soft and brilliant, flashing in <b>the</b> ruddy <b>firelight.</b> It was no vision; it was she beyond a doubt! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a {{few moments}} we {{regarded}} each other in silence; then {{the door opened and}} the old man returned. He stood aghast as he saw <b>the</b> warm <b>firelight,</b> and then approaching the table mechanically put down a couple of bottles.|$|R
