The two met at TNA's No Surrender PPV event on September 9, 2007, where Cage defeated Joe by disqualification when Joe refused to release his Coquina Clutch submission hold he had applied. The two had a rematch on October 14, 2007 at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event with Matt Morgan as the special outside enforcer. There, Joe defeated Cage to end his 23-month-long undefeated streak by not officially being pinned nor made to submit.

Cage defeated Kaz, but due to interference from Styles and Tomko on Cage's behalf, the match was declared a no contest, with the finals being determined on November 11, 2007 at TNA's Genesis PPV event in a ladder match.

25|$|The Tigers {{began their}} match {{one day before}} Australia and Sri Lanka faced off in the VB Series, and {{recorded}} their first win since November; the Bushrangers, by contrast, hadn't lost since November. The first-innings third-wicket stand between Michael Di Venuto and Travis Birt of the Tigers was worth 143, eight more than Victoria managed in their first innings, and though Cameron White and Shane Warne scored half-centuries for Victoria <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> they fell 121 short of their target of 409.

Leicestershire's bowlers were smashed to all corners, Phil DeFreitas the only one who escaped with some respectability as he took two for 50 in eleven overs.

Leicestershire surpassed their first innings score with five wickets in hand <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> though, before Gough and Napier dug out two wickets to have them 228 for 7. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman had all passed 30, and Claude Henderson paired up with Ackerman to add 96 for the eighth wicket – the second-highest partnership of the match, as Leicestershire {{made their way to}} a lead of 190. Gough was the only bowler to take more than two wickets, ending with four for 60, while Steyn conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Gibson.|$|E
25|$|Day three {{began with}} the weather again threatening, and Chappell {{declared}} the Australian innings closed without returning to the crease {{to try to make}} a game of it. However Glamorgan openers Jones and Hopkins made much better work of it <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> pushing the score past 100 without loss. With Australia's frontline bowlers struggling to make a breakthrough, spinner Ray Bright was brought on, and made an immediate impact, having the advancing Hopkins stumped brilliantly by replacement wicket-keeper Richie Robinson for 66. Bright troubled the Glamorgan batsmen with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and soon claimed another, Arthur Francis for 2, leaving Glamorgan on 119–2. Gwyn Richards arrived as his replacement and tried to lift the scoring, but Bright soon claimed Jones for 47, and Mike Llewellyn for 9. Glamorgan had reached 164 for 4 off 43 overs and decided to end their innings and give the Australian's a competitive target. Bright finished with 4 for 53.|$|E

Bryant's individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62–61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since {{the introduction of the}} shot clock. When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them.

There are ten gold nuggets and 30 Dream Pieces molding ten Dream Jewels to complete; other 58 gold nuggets and 60 Dream Pieces work as bonus scores, which are all scattered throughout the game. Like Dream Chronicles 2, players need to replay the game several times to be able to find all of 16 Dream Jewels. At the end of the game, players earn a high score. The faster how players can complete the game, the more Dream Pieces and gold nuggets they can find, the more Dream Jewels they can forge, the better score they will earn.

25|$|However, Gloucestershire bowled {{with more}} effect <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a {{marathon}} 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket {{with his first}} ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven {{as they made their}} way to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win - which would have been a first class record chase. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.|$|E
25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were well on their way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
25|$|A {{round of}} three-day games started at Hobart on 1 February, with the Warriors bowling out the Tigers for 86 on first innings, as Steve Magoffin took bowling figures of 17–12–15–3. Chris Rogers then outscored the Tigers by hitting 135 in the Warriors' total of 215, {{and though the}} Tigers posted 276 <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> the Warriors chased it down with seven wickets to spare after a {{partnership}} of 106 between Rogers and Shaun Marsh. On 2 February, play began at the 'Gabba, where Queensland built a 287-run lead on first innings after 116 from Martin Love and half-centuries from numbers eight and nine, Andy Bichel and Daniel Doran. The Blues responded with 378, but Love and Shane Watson took Queensland past the target of 92 inside 17 overs after the first two wickets fell for 20. The Redbacks also surrendered a first-innings lead at Adelaide, though Victoria fell from one for 164 to 249 all out, and despite 68 off 64 balls from Shaun Tait of the Redbacks, the Bushrangers chased down the target after a half-century from Jason Arnberger.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh A, {{still without}} a win on tour of England, shocked Gloucestershire {{initially}} at Bristol. Shahadat Hossain took three wickets for the tourists, and Syed Rasel and Talha Jubair also chipped in, as Gloucestershire imploded to 72 for 7. However, 83 from wicketkeeper Stephen Snell lifted them to 232, before Jon Lewis and James Averis {{dug into the}} tourists to reduce them to 29 for 3. However, Tushar Imran played {{his way to his}} fourth first-class century, a career-best 119, to give the tourists a slender lead of 19 after a 122-run fourth-wicket stand between Tushar and Alok Kapali. However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> and after losing Kadeer Ali for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before declaring as Alex Gidman recorded a 94-ball century. Sri Lankan overseas player Malinga Bandara then took five for 45 with his leg-spin as the tourists imploded from 106 for 2 to 181 all out.|$|E
25|$|Shane Bond {{took three}} wickets {{in his first}} six overs in his first Test match for a year, and Sri Lanka were bowled out for 154 with only Tharanga and Chamara Kapugedera passing 20. In reply, New Zealand trailed by 41 with six wickets in hand, but Daniel Vettori's half-century helped score 206 against a Muttiah Muralitharan-led bowling attack. Murali took four for 65 from 34 overs, while Chaminda Vaas took two wickets in an over and ended with three for 49. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> Kumar Sangakkara made an unbeaten century from number three, {{out of a total}} of 170. After {{completing}} an easy single to complete Sangakkara's century Muralitharan walked down the pitch to celebrate while the ball was being returned to the wicketkeeper. McCullum then appealed for a runout and Muralitharan was dismissed, ending Sri Lanka's second innings. After the match Jayawardene expressed the Sri Lankan team's disappointment about the incident, saying it was contrary to the spirit of the game, but Fleming and McCullum were unrepentant. New Zealand managed to reach the modest target of 118 to win the game, despite a mini-collapse.|$|E

Coincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors. Anthony fell short of establishing a new record in his ninth game (a 113–109 home victory over the Chicago Bulls) on November 21, as he finished with 29 points. After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6. During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl. Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern. Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson in a bid to form a deadly combination with Anthony. The duo didn't get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension. Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points.|$|E

The fourth day continued in the same vain as Khaled Mashud was bowled for a duck in the second over of the day and both Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie made up for their first innings oversight by bowling and trapping the last five wickets of Bangladeshi for 88 runs, the former improving his previous 0-112 to this innings' 3-28, despite Mohammad Rafique taking three fours off him. Australia started the final innings in the knowledge that they have only twice, in fifty years, managed to pull off a second innings score higher than the first, needing as they did 307 runs for victory. Taking no risks, Australia's openers made a calm 67 either side of the tea break before captain Ricky Ponting came out with seven boundaries and an unbeaten 72 at the close of play. The second wicket partnership stood for 106 before Australian wickets began to tumble with two removals from left-arm slow bowler Mohammad Rafique to leave the team at 212-4, with only their high-scoring skipper and Adam Gilchrist (6*) in the way of their five bowlers at the lower order.|$|E
