500|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{stated in}} August 2006 that a {{continuation}} of the X-Men main film series would require a renegotiation. New cast members of [...] were signed, while the older cast members were not. Donner said, [...] "There is forty years worth of stories. I've always wanted to do 'Days of Future Past' and there are just really a lot of stories yet to be told". She later pitched the idea of a fourth installment of the X-Men franchise to director Bryan Singer, following the completion of the 2011 prequel [...] In March 2011, Donner said the film was in [...] "active development at Fox"; she said, [...] "We took the treatment to Fox and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it...</b> And X4 leads into X5".|$|E
500|$|Spears's manager Adam Leber {{responded in}} his Twitter account, saying, [...] "It's unfortunate that one {{journalist}} in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted {{a list of}} positive reviews {{from a number of}} fans. Burswood Dome also issued a statament reading, [...] "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert". Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{there is a lot of}} controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating [...] "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".|$|E
500|$|Crace {{was pleased}} with public {{reaction}} to the mother-daughter storyline, commenting prior to the reveal: [...] "Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn't told Ronnie yet, so I'm taking that as a sign they're enjoying the story. Viewers are always telling me that <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're {{on the edge of}} their seats, waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." [...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E

2500|$|In November, Raisman {{decided to}} become a {{professional}} athlete, giving up her NCAA eligibility and a scholarship to University of Florida. She signed with the Octagon sports management firm. She said: [...] "It was a hard decision, but I’ve always thought about it {{in the back of my}} mind. I just wanted to try it and have no regrets, because I thought if I didn’t try to go pro, I’d always wonder. I know all the girls at Florida, and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> there so much. But not a lot of people get the opportunity to be a professional gymnast and be able to have sponsors. I love fashion, so it’s cool to be sponsored by Ralph Lauren." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie was}} {{critically}} acclaimed but, in Hill's words, it [...] "didn't make a... nickel anywhere. Foreign domestic, anything... I {{was proud of}} the film...

5000|$|The artist José Luis Cuevas said: [...] "Ninon Sevilla {{can get to}} {{the worst}} scoundrel as in Sensualidad. In Aventurera is the victim, but in Sensualidad she's not. This, to the French seemed surrealism. <b>They</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> A species of the Marquis de Sade to the bourgeois morality".|$|R

6000|$|... "Rather!" [...] {{said the}} great Chief, with a sad relapse into the normal. [...] "I suppose {{that is why}} <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> so. Now, then, warriors, we go forth on the war-trail. One whoop all {{together}} before we start. Capital! Follow me, now, one behind the other. Not a sound!

[...] "We've men {{in every part}} of the world doing what seems like dirty work, ill-paid work, too, doing it partly, perhaps, because the {{excitement}} grows on them and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> but always, they have to start in cold blood. The papers don't always tell the truth, you know. There's many a death in foreign cities you read of as a suicide, or the result of an accident, when it's really the sacrifice of a hero for his country. It's great work, Richard." ...|$|E

But we got a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS which we were pretty much allowed to do anything with...we spent it on doing some research into how people perceived Masterpiece. And discovered that they used to watch <b>it,</b> <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it,</b> <b>they</b> regarded it very highly. They weren't watching it so much anymore. They thought it was too hard to find...And a lot of people were put off by the title. They thought, oh it sounds like it will be very challenging. It sounds like homework....We didn't change the content because we realized whenever anybody, particularly younger viewers watched it, watched Madame Bovary or Sense and Sensibility or Bleak House, <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>it.</b> It was just sort of getting past the rather forbidding title of Masterpiece Theater and the confusing anthology nature.” ...|$|R

6000|$|THE LIFE. If the {{literature}} of a people springs directly out of its life, then the stern, barbarous life of our Saxon forefathers would seem, at first glance, to promise little of good literature. Outwardly their life was a constant hardship, a perpetual struggle against savage nature and savage men. Behind them were gloomy forests inhabited by wild beasts and still wilder men, and peopled in their imagination with dragons and evil shapes. In front of them, thundering at the very dikes for entrance, was the treacherous North Sea, with its fogs and storms and ice, but with that indefinable call of the deep that all men hear who live long beneath its influence. Here they lived, a big, blond, powerful race, and hunted and fought and sailed, and drank and feasted when their labor was done. Almost {{the first thing we}} notice about these big, fearless, childish men is that they love the sea; and because <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> they hear and answer its call: ...|$|E
60|$|It is said of Ahab he sold {{himself to}} work wickedness: {{and in another}} place, yea, 'for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves' (1 Kings 21:25; Isa 50:1). But what is this iniquity? Why, a thing of nought; nay, worse than nought a {{thousand}} times; but because nought is as we say nought, therefore it goes under that term, where God saith again to the people, 'Ye have sold yourselves for nought' (Isa 52:3). But, I say, what an amazing thing is this, that a rational creature should make no better a bargain; that one that is so wise in all terrene things, should be such a fool in {{the thing that is}} most weighty? And yet such a fool he is, and he tells every one that goes by the way that he is such an one, because he will not break his league with sin until his heart is broken for it. Men love darkness rather than light. Ay, they make it manifest <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> since so great a proffer will not prevail with them to leave it.|$|E

You can't tell me that that was not genuine. <b>They</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> How hard," [...] she proceeded commiseratingly, [...] "you must have worked, poor boy, during the tour on the road to improve the piece so much! I never liked to say so before but even you must agree with me now that that original version of yours, which was done down at Newport, was the most terrible nonsense! And how hard the company must have worked too! Otie," [...] cried Mrs. Peagrim, aglow with the magic of a brilliant idea, [...] "I will tell you what you must really do.

[...] "What work could be harder," [...] they ask, [...] "than carrying this organ about all day?"

6000|$|Further, {{this word}} [...] "saved," [...] it concludeth {{deliverance}} from death and hell. How, then, can he tell {{what it is}} to be saved that never was sensible of the sorrows of the one, nor distressed with the pains of the other? The Psalmist says, [...] "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord"--(mark, then), [...] "then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul,"--then, in my distress. When he knew what it was to be saved, then he called, because, I say, then he knew what it was to be saved (Psa 18:4,5; 116:3,4). I say, this is the man, and this only, that knows {{what it is to}} be saved. And this is evident, as is manifest by the little regard that the rest have to saving, or the little dread they have of damnation. Where is he that seeks and groans for salvation? I say, where is he that hath taken his flight for salvation, because of the dread of the wrath to come? [...] "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" [...] (Matt 3:7). Alas! do not the most set light by salvation?--as for sin, how do <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> embrace it, please themselves with it, hide it still within their mouth, and keep it close under their tongue. Besides, for the wrath of God, they feel it not, they fly not from it; and for hell, it is become a doubt to many if there be any, and a mock to those whose doubt is resolved by atheism.|$|E
6000|$|I don't mention Bristol as if {{that were}} the part furthest gone in this mortification. Far from it: I know that there is, rather, a little more life in us than in any other place. In Liverpool they are {{literally}} almost ruined by this American war; but <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> as they suffer from it. In short, from whatever I see, and from whatever quarter I hear, I am convinced that everything that is not absolute stagnation is evidently a party-spirit very adverse to our politics, and to the principles from whence they arise. There are manifest marks of the resurrection of the Tory party. They no longer criticize, as all disengaged people in the world will, on the acts of government; but they are silent under every evil, and hide and cover up every ministerial blander and misfortune, with the officious zeal of men who think they have a party of their own to support in power. The Tories do universally think their power and consequence involved in the success of this American business. The clergy are astonishingly warm in it; and what the Tories are, when embodied and united with their natural head, the crown, and animated by their clergy, no man knows better than yourself. As to the Whigs, I think them far from extinct. They are, what they always were, (except by the able use of opportunities,) by far the weakest party in this country. They have not yet learned the application of their principles to the present state of things; and as to the Dissenters, the main effective part of the Whig strength, they are, to use a favorite expression of our American campaign style, [...] "not all in force." [...] They will do very little, and, as far as I can discern, are rather intimidated than provoked at the denunciations of the court in the Archbishop of York's sermon. I thought that sermon rather imprudent, when I first saw it; but it seems to have done its business.|$|E
