25|$|The Malpighiales {{are divided}} into 32 to 42 families, {{depending}} upon which clades in the order are given the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> of family. In the APG III system, 35 families are recognized. Medusagynaceae, Quiinaceae, Peraceae, Malesherbiaceae, Turneraceae, Samydaceae, and Scyphostegiaceae are consolidated into other families. The largest family, by far, is the Euphorbiaceae, with about 6300 species in about 245 genera.|$|E
25|$|Some DNA {{sequence}} {{studies suggest}} that Collembola represent a separate evolutionary line from the other Hexapoda, but others disagree; {{this seems to be}} caused by widely divergent patterns of molecular evolution among the arthropods. The adjustments of traditional <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> for springtails reflects the occasional incompatibility of traditional groupings with modern cladistics: when they were included with the insects, they were ranked as an order; as part of the Entognatha, they are ranked as a subclass. If they are considered a basal lineage of Hexapoda, they are elevated to full class status.|$|E
25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species {{not because they are}} more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E

25|$|In sheer numbers, {{they are}} {{reputed to be}} one of the most {{abundant}} of all macroscopic animals, with estimates of 100,000 individuals per square meter of ground, essentially everywhere on Earth where soil and related habitats (moss cushions, fallen wood, grass tufts, ant and termite nests) occur. Only nematodes, crustaceans, and mites are likely to have global populations of similar magnitude, and each of those groups except mites is more inclusive: though <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> cannot be used for absolute comparisons, it is notable that nematodes are a phylum and crustaceans a subphylum. Most springtails are small and difficult to see by casual observation, but one springtail, the so-called snow flea (Hypogastrura nivicola), is readily observed on warm winter days when it is active and its dark color contrasts sharply with a background of snow.|$|E

Termites were once classified {{in a separate}} order from cockroaches, but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from close ancestors of cockroaches during the Jurassic or Triassic. However, the first termites possibly emerged during the Permian or even the Carboniferous. About 3,106 species are currently described, with a few hundred more left to be described. Although these insects are often called [...] "white ants", they are not ants.|$|E
500|$|The Paratheria {{hypothesis}} {{enjoyed a}} brief renaissance when unusual, high-crowned teeth began {{turning up in}} the Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil record of Argentina. In 1984, Sudamerica ameghinoi, from the Paleocene of Argentina, was assigned to Xenarthra within Paratheria, ranked as a cohort (a <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> between infraclass and superorder). Two years later, Jos√© Bonaparte named Gondwanatherium patagonicum from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina, which he thought {{to be related to}} Sudamerica, and tentatively assigned it to Paratheria, now ranked as an infraclass. Bonaparte described an additional related animal, Vucetichia gracilis, from the Argentinean Late Cretaceous in 1990; by then he classified it in the order Gondwanatheria, which was tentatively assigned to the infraclass Paratheria. Bonaparte argued against George Gaylord Simpson's 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from the Tertiary Palaeanodonta of North America, and instead suggested that xenarthrans, and perhaps pangolins, split from eutherians (placentals and their extinct relatives) as early as the Early Cretaceous and derived from some early [...] "pantothere" [...] (a now-abandoned grouping of early mammals, including dryolestoids among others).|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first named 1936 as Boletus felleus forma plumbeoviolaceus by American mycologist Walter H. Snell {{and one of}} his {{graduate}} students, Esther A. Dick, based on specimens found in the Black Rock Forest near Cornwall, New York. Regarding his decision to use the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> forma, Snell wrote: [...] "The writer hesitates to multiply the number of forms (formae) and varieties with distinctive names, because of the ease with which one develops the habit of interpreting slight variations as definite taxonomic units... the word [...] "form" [...] is used instead of [...] "variety" [...] as making no commitment as to the actual status of the variable segregate under consideration, until further information is available." [...] The first collections made of the mushroom were of young, immature specimens, from which authors were unable to obtain spores for examination. It was not until a few years after that they found mature fruit bodies, which revealed that the rosy color of the pore surface took some time to develop. They concluded that this and other differences in physical characteristics, as well as differences in spore size, were enough to justify it being a species distinct from B.felleus, so in 1941 they raised the taxon to species status with the name Boletus plumbeoviolaceus. Noted Agaricales taxonomist Rolf Singer later transferred the taxon to Tylopilus in 1947, a genus characterized by a spore print that is pink, or wine red (vinaceous), rather than brown as in Boletus.|$|E

However, the grouping of Sibley & Monroe (besides leaving the subfamily rank vacant) is overly coarse due to methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA hybridization technique and most of their proposed revisions of <b>taxonomic</b> <b>rank</b> have not been accepted (see for example Ciconiiformes). The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping is all but noninformative as regards biogeography, and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages.
