[...] In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In the video, bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al-Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks. On December 27, 2001, a second bin Laden video was released. In the video, he said: ...|$|E

[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Say It Right" [...] is {{performed}} with a moderate techno groove and {{is written in}} F minor. It is set in common time; in 4/4 count. The chord progression is Fm–E♭–D♭–B♭m. Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said. In fact the song deals with mystic or transcendental experiences as she explains {{in an interview in}} 2007. [...] "It {{is a kind of a}} magical song. It has a mystery to it, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." ...|$|E
500|$|A coach from Manchester {{eventually}} arrived bearing four surgeons, led by William Robert Whatton. By {{this time}} Huskisson was suffering severe spasms, and those present were having {{to hold his}} arms and legs down to stop him falling off the sofa. Whatton assessed that Huskisson was suffering from severe haemorrhaging from the initial wound and subsequent blood loss, and that amputation was necessary to prevent a fatal loss of blood. However, in Huskisson's agitated condition Whatton felt that traumatic surgery would likely prove fatal. Whatton and his colleagues applied warm water to Huskisson's chest, feet and hands, and gave him warm cordials and further laudanum in an effort to calm him enough to withstand the shock of surgery. At around 3.00pm the party heard the sound of cannon fire from the west. Told that the cannons were probably being fired to mark the arrival of the Prime Minister in Manchester, Huskisson said [...] "I hope to God the Duke may get safe through the day". At around 4.00pm Huskisson had regained enough strength to dictate to William Wainewright, his secretary, a brief amendment to his will ensuring that Emily Huskisson would inherit all his property, and shakily signed it. He then requested the sacrament, which was performed by the Rev Blackburne, and read the Lord's Prayer with Wilton. When Huskisson came to the line [...] "and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us", he said [...] "That I do most heartily; and I declare to God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> the slightest feeling of ill-will towards any human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Ryelandt wrote a {{great deal}} of vocal music, his ideal was {{absolute}} music. But there was an ideal beyond that. For Ryelandt, music was a religious vocation. The following words from the preface to his Notices sur mes oeuvres sum up what really mattered to him: “I think … I can say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been a useless servant of art. I have done what I could. The future will decide if anything of this work will survive me to the greater glory of God.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Midway through 2007, the [...] "rebel" [...] Indian Cricket League (ICL) was formed. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which {{opposed the}} league, {{declared}} that players and officials affiliating with the ICL will {{be banned from}} Indian domestic cricket. In August 2007, {{it was reported that}} Rayudu and six other players from Hyderabad had already signed up for the ICL. In an interview in November 2007, Rayudu backed his decision to play in the ICL by remarking, [...] "I didn't want to play ten years of domestic cricket and feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> played any international-quality opposition." [...] He added that it was a chance [...] "to play against quality opposition for three years and it will also be telecast on TV. People will hopefully see me perform. And I want to perform for my own personal satisfaction." [...] He played for Hyderabad Heroes and ICL India in the ICL from 2007 to 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2002, the band's first North American tour since 1993 was {{organized}} to support Chinese Democracy, with CKY and Mix Master Mike joining. However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose failed to turn up. According to Guns' management, [...] "Axl's flight from L.A. had been delayed by mechanical troubles". A riot ensued. This tour {{was met with}} mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York City sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia when the band {{failed to show up}} again, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour. Rose later mentioned in 2006, [...] "There are reasons <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> spoken more about [...] that have been extremely complicated and are not legally resolved behind the scenes to this day and could have possibly jeopardized the future of Guns N' Roses." [...] Rose then apologized to the city of Philadelphia when playing there in 2012, adding [...] "I'm not saying I'm innocent".|$|E
2500|$|Paramount Pictures was {{concerned}} with the film's budget, which reportedly was almost $50 million. By 1997, multiple script drafts from three writers brought costs to approximately $2 million. After delays in production, Paramount Pictures told the group behind the film they had two months to set the project up at another studio. In a review of Carr's sequel The Angel of Darkness, Malcolm L. Johnson of The Hartford Courant cited concerns over how to depict the mutilation of the murdered prostitutes in the film, writing: [...] "Questions about how to treat this gruesome element has perhaps delayed the film of The Alienist." [...] When in a 1999 online chat with fans, set up by Time and Yahoo!, Carr was asked if there were film plans for The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness, he responded: [...] "Only 'The Alienist,' and the attempts have been so bad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet sold 'Angel' to the movies. What happened was that a producer bought the rights and then decided he had to completely change {{the characters in the}} book. We got into a huge conflict, one that is actually ongoing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and I was left with the impression <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> succeeded in getting the hang of this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly work them out".|$|E
2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God to send you a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the second}} round of talks, a day before Croitoru's nomination, Băsescu noted: [...] "Some parties have {{proposed}} Klaus Iohannis. I would like you to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> rejected the possibility for him to become Prime Minister in the condition that my options would be directed towards other [...] solutions. But I have rejected such a proposal because it comes from PSD or another party [...] ", referring to his alleged constraint to consider a proposal of the largest party (PDL), constraint disputed by the other parties. The opposition criticized the President for not designating Iohannis. Social Democrat leader Mircea Geoană accused Băsescu of trying to influence the upcoming presidential elections by having them organised by a sympathetic government. Crin Antonescu, the leader of the National Liberals, vowed his party would derail other nominations but Iohannis'. After the nomination of Croitoru, Antonescu, a candidate in the presidential election, stated that he would nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister if elected President. Three days later, on 18 October Geoană suggested Antonescu was trying to use Iohannis as an [...] "electoral agent" [...] for Antonescu's bid for president. In response, Antonescu told the press that Iohannis [...] "is not the type of person that would let himself being used". Geoană and PSD leadership has held a second meeting with Iohannis in Bucharest in the evening of 18 October. UDMR, which the previous day announced it would also attend, declared in the morning that all their leaders are not in the city. PNL was present at the meeting by lower level representatives, after Antonescu announced in the morning he is on campaign in Cluj-Napoca. On 21 October the Parliament adopted with 252 votes for (of PSD, PNL, UDMR and minorities groups) and 2 against a declaration requesting the President to nominate Iohannis as Prime Minister.|$|E
