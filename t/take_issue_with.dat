25|$|Horowitz {{has been}} criticized for {{material}} in his books, particularly , by noted scholars such as Columbia University professor Todd Gitlin. The group Free Exchange on Campus issued a 50-page report in May 2006 in which they <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> many of Horowitz's assertions in the book: they identify specific factual errors, unsubstantiated assertions, and quotations which appear to be either misquoted or taken out of context.|$|E
25|$|On 21 January 2007, a {{decision}} was made by the organisers to discourage Big Day Out patrons in Sydney from bringing and displaying the Australian flag. The organisers said the decision was a result of recent ethnic tensions in Sydney, complaints that the previous year's festival had been marred by roving packs of aggressive flag-draped youths, and recognition that some indigenous Australians <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> celebrating the start of British settlement.|$|E
25|$|Packaged and {{processed}} foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so {{may be a}} special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role {{in the production of}} cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> its consumption.|$|E

In September 2011, {{it was reported that}} the Dowler family had been offered £2m in personal damages. In January 2012, it was reported that Surrey Police and other police forces knew soon after Dowler's death that News of the World staff had accessed her mobile phone messages, but did not <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> this. Instead a senior Surrey officer invited newspaper staff to a meeting to discuss the case.|$|E
25|$|Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century (1998), <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> {{what they}} {{consider}} Denisoff's reductive approach to the history and function of song (and particularly traditional song) in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had {{paid little attention to}} the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number (as in Portuguese fado, which only has 64 tunes), nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point out that some of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. They also note that:There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoff's, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing {{the emergence of a new}} movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader framework in which tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory.|$|E
500|$|Some historians, such as Zabecki and Peter Lieb, also <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> Rommel's {{absence from}} Normandy {{on the day}} of the Allied invasion, 6 June 1944. He had left France on 5 June and was at home on the 6th celebrating his wife's birthday. Rommel either planned or claimed to have planned to proceed to see Hitler the next day to discuss the {{situation}} in Normandy. Zabecki calls his decision to leave the theatre in view of an imminent invasion [...] "an incredible lapse of command responsibility".|$|E

500|$|Another academic, Richard H.

Rochelle C. Dreyfus is also reported to have criticized the decision, noting that Bowman was attempting to obtain the benefit of the genetic modifications, while others, such as organic growers, fear being sued for inadvertent cross-contamination. Additionally, the Harvard Law Review wrote that [...] "he Court reached the correct outcome but via the wrong route" [...] because its ruling [...] "obfuscates the role of the licensing agreement" [...] and because the [...] "exhaustion doctrine is ill suited to address the challenges posed by self-replicating technologies".|$|E
500|$|The 1993 County Report on Human Rights Practices in Jamaica {{from the}} United States Department of State noted {{the denial of}} a [...] "fair public trial" [...] and alleged that Gun Court trials observe [...] "less {{rigorous}} rules of evidence than in regular court proceedings." [...] The Canadian Bar Association's Jamaican Justice System Reform Task Force, in its preliminary recommendations, noted that the Gun Court is overloaded, that defendants are not well represented, and Crown attorneys are often inexperienced. [...] The report recommended that trials no longer be held in camera, and that cases be moved to the ordinary Circuit Court to relieve the overburdened Gun Court. [...] It did not <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> non-jury trials, suggesting that the same practice might be used in more types of cases for greater efficiency.|$|E
500|$|Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy {{was very}} well {{received}} by reviewers, with Patrick Gann saying that [...] "the music itself is brilliant" [...] and that [...] "the arrangements are stunning" [...] while remarking {{not only on the}} nostalgia inherent in the music but also the combination of the choir and orchestra. Other reviewers such as Chris and Simon from Square Enix Music Online agreed, terming the album [...] "an orchestral masterpiece amassed with some of the best quality and most subtle attempts of arranging available in the Final Fantasy series' discography" [...] and [...] "technically accomplished and on scale that was rarely done at the time of making", respectively. Isaac Engelhorn of Soundtrack Central also enjoyed the album, calling it [...] "wonderful" [...] and his favorite Final Fantasy arranged album, although he did <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the length of the album, as well as the sound quality.|$|E

500|$|As {{the exact}} nature of Poison's status as gender-variant has been left {{deliberately}} ambiguous by Capcom, the topic has remained a popular subject for debate among fans and gaming media alike. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Eric L. Patterson described her as being a significant character to the trans community, and a perfect example of how it is [...] "so awkward when it comes to knowing how to deal with characters who aren't white, male, and heterosexual" [...] in video games. Complex pointed her out as an example of stereotypical depiction of trans hookers, listing Poison among The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters in Video Games. GamesRadar commented [...] "Poison holds a distinction as one of gaming’s first trans characters, which began as a strange choice in localization but has {{become a part of the}} character that she wears with pride. If you <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> it, that’s your problem, not hers. It's that kind of confidence that makes her so appealing." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} of time valuation concerns {{the choice of}} monetary levels. How should unpaid work be valued when more than one activity is being performed or more than one output is produced? Another issue concerns differences in quality between market and household products. Some feminist economists <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> using the market system to determine values {{for a variety of}} reasons: it may lead {{to the conclusion that the}} market provides perfect substitutes for non-market work; the wage produced in the market for services may not accurately reflect the actual opportunity cost of time spent in household production; and the wages used in valuation methods come from industries where wages are already depressed because of gender inequalities, and so will not accurately value unpaid work. A related argument is that the market [...] "accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination." ...|$|E
500|$|Hadley {{found the}} most {{important}} contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be {{the application of a}} Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that [...] "assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> in Cochrane's analysis". However, for Hadley, there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane's theory, as there is in most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, [...] "only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality." [...] Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it [...] "ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [...] reasoning, assuming you accept animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible." ...|$|E

500|$|When The Atlantic Monthly {{published}} a glowing {{review of the}} Reverend William J. Long's 1902 work School of the Woods: Some Life Studies of Animal Instinct and Animal Training, Burroughs became incensed. Long had previously published six books, and while Burroughs was not pleased with the clergyman's previous efforts, he believed this particular work was an unacceptable example of nature writing. Long insisted not only that animals demonstrated unique and individualistic behavior, unpredictable to science, but he also wrote that there was [...] "absolutely no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of Nature, even in a single species." [...] Burroughs {{was not the first}} to <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the growing genre that blurred the line between fact and fiction, or the liberties it often took with the natural world; Ernest Ingersoll also found fault with School of the Woods, stating it [...] "would be an epoch-making book in both zoology and psychology could its statements be established." [...] Believing that authors such as Long were deliberately misleading the public for financial gain, Burroughs decided to prove that their fantastical depictions of wild animals were not only impossible, but ultimately damaging to the general public's understanding of nature.|$|E
500|$|Manson {{began his}} {{long-term}} collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein in May 2002, collaborating on several projects {{associated with the}} album. In addition to the album artwork, the pair created large-scale multi-media installation art pieces that {{would go on to}} be exhibited in various galleries throughout Europe and the United States. These were also displayed at the album's launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles. They also worked together on the music video to lead single [...] "Mobscene" [...] (stylized as [...] "mOBSCENE"), as well as images which accompanied Manson's essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Helnwein later expressed disappointment that the latter was not selected as the album cover. Many of the images found in the album artwork were inspired by illustrations found in Mel Gordon's 2000 book Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin. Concerned that Gordon might <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> use of the book's material, Manson called Gordon, who said he could not imagine a greater compliment than a popular music album based on an academic book. The Golden Age of Grotesque was also the title of Manson's first art exhibition, which took place in September 2002 at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Center.|$|E
500|$|Numerous critics <b>take</b> <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the Bundeswehr's reverence towards Rommel as {{its primary}} role model. While [...] {{recognizing}} his great talents as a commander, {{they point out}} several problems like Rommel's involvement with a criminal regime, his political naivete, or {{that he can not}} teach the society modern values like democracy, pacifism, critical thinking or feminism. The politician scientist [...] calls for his replacement with Manfred von Richthofen. Cornelia Hecht opines that whatever judgement history will pass on Rommel – who was the idol of World War II as well as the integration figure of the post-war Republic – it is now the time the Bundeswehr should rely on its own history and tradition and not any Wehrmacht commander., a retired Bundeswehr officer, writes that the maintenance of the Rommel barracks' names and the definition of Rommel as a resistance fighter are capitulation before neo-Nazi tendencies. Heiducoff agrees with Bundeswehr generals that Rommel {{was one of the greatest}} strategists and tacticians, both in theory and practice, and a victim of contemporary jealous colleagues, but argues that such a talent for aggressive, destructive warfare is not a suitable model for the Bundeswehr, a primarily defensive army. Heiducoff criticizes Bundeswehr generals for pressuring the Ministry of Defence into making decisions in favour of the man they openly admire. The Green Party's position is that Rommel was not a war criminal but still had entanglements with war crimes, and that he could not be the Bundeswehr's role model.|$|E

The NME felt that the EP showed the Super Furry Animals had fulfilled their early promise and {{was the result of the}} band having [...] "ideas like most people have cups of tea", awarding Ice Hockey Hair 'single of the week' in their 23 May 1998 issue. The magazine called [...] "Smokin'" [...] "compact disco" [...] and stated that [...] "Mu-Tron" [...] was an [...] "ugly name for a beautiful song". [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was described as a combination of Queen, ELO, Wings, and [...] "mad techno squalling" [...] which sounds like [...] "Elton John's glitter-coated grand piano" [...] falling from the sky.
