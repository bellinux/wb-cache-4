2500|$|The word Hindu {{is derived}} from the Indo-Aryan/Sanskrit root Sindhu, the Indo-Aryan name for the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent (modern day Pakistan and Northern India). According to Gavin Flood, [...] "The actual term 'Hindu' first occurs as a Persian {{geographical}} term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu)", more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I (550–486 BCE).

50|$|On {{the modern}} Internet, WHOIS {{services}} are typically communicated using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Servers listen to requests on the well-known port number 43. Clients are simple applications that establish a communications channel to the server, transmit a <b>text</b> <b>record</b> {{with the name}} of the resource to be queried and await the response in form of a sequence of text records found in the database. This simplicity of the protocol also permits an application, and a command line interface user, to query a WHOIS server using the Telnet protocol.|$|E
5000|$|A special byte {{within the}} {{relocation}} and/or control record buffer {{is used as}} a [...] "disabled bit spin" [...] communication area, and is initialized to a unique value. The Read CCW for that relocation and/or control record has the Program Controlled Interrupt bit set. The processor is thereby notified when that CCW has been accessed by the channel via a special IOS exit. At this point the processor enters the [...] "disabled bit spin" [...] loop (sometimes called [...] "the shortest loop in the world"). Once that byte has been changed from its initialized value, the processor instantaneously knows reading of the relocation and/or control record has been completed, the bit spin is terminated, and relocation may proceed in real-time, and synchronously with the rotation of the media (relocation occurs during the [...] "gap" [...] within the media between the relocation and/or control record and the next <b>text</b> <b>record).</b> If so, after relocation of that <b>text</b> <b>record</b> is completed, the NOP CCW will be changed to a TIC, and loading and relocating will proceed using the next buffer. If not, then the channel will encounter the NOP CCW, and the channel program will terminate, until it is restarted by IEWFETCH via another special IOS exit. The three buffers are in a continuous circular queue, each pointing to its next, and the last pointing to the first, and three buffers are constantly reused as loading and relocating proceeds.|$|E

5000|$|Program-controlled interruptionPoOps {{indicates}} that the channel has fetched a CCW with the PCI bit set. The channel continues processing; this interruption simply informs the CPU of the channel's progress.

After relocation, a NOP CCW is changed to a TIC and the channel program continues.

50|$|Protein {{database}} is {{an important}} protein resource at NCBI. It maintains the <b>text</b> <b>record</b> for individual protein sequences, derived from many different resources such as NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project, GenbBank, PDB and UniProtKB/SWISS-Prot. Protein records are present in different formats including FASTA and XML and are linked to other NCBI resources. Protein provides the relevant data to the users such as genes, DNA/RNA sequences, biological pathways, expression and variation data and literature. It also provides the pre-determined sets of similar and identical proteins for each sequence as computed by the BLAST. The Structure database of NCBI contains 3D coordinate sets for experimentally-determined structures in PDB that are imported by NCBI. The Conserved Domain database (CDD) of protein contains sequence profiles that characterize highly conserved domains within protein sequences. It also has records from external resources like SMART and Pfam.There is another database in protein known as Protein Clusters database which contains sets of proteins sequences that are clustered according to the maximum alignments between the individual sequences as calculated by BLAST.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{stated in}} Kadrung Nornang's <b>text</b> <b>Record</b> of Ten Thousand Years that, after the 1642 {{completion}} of the Gelugpa/Mongol conquest of Tibet {{and at the time}} of Sonam Rapten's assumption of [...] "the leadership of the government as regent", [...] "he was known as Chakdzö Sönam Rapten or Tsenzhen Gyalé Chödzé. Subsequently, he changed his name to Sönam Chöpel. So the three names refer to one person. When he became the regent he was called the emperor of the world." [...] In Dukula, whenever the Fifth refers to him by name instead of title ('Zhalngo') he always uses 'Sonam Rapten'. Apart from Richardson, who follows the Fifth's example, most other sources, including Shakabpa, Dhondup and Mullin, always refer to him by his later name of 'Sönam Chöphel' or similar. It is suggested by Richardson that perhaps the name-change was effected by Güshri Khan in 1637 on the occasion of titles being exchanged between the Tibetan and Mongolian leaders, however {{there is no mention of}} this in the sources, on the contrary it is stated that the title conferred on Rapten on that occasion was [...] "Dalai Chagdzo".
