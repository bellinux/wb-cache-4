500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about movies is how conventional they are, and then you have people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about his character?'".|$|E
2500|$|The film {{examines}} many {{historical events}} of the twentieth century, particularly the rise of Hitler, communism and technology. Godard quotes lengthy passages from Jacques Ellul's 1945 essay [...] "Victoire d'Hitler?" [...] In this essay Ellul wrote [...] "everything Hitler said, he accomplished" [...] and examined {{the dangers of the}} individual giving absolute power to the State. Ellul concluded that [...] "everything that the State conquers as a power, it never loses. And that's Hitler's second victory." [...] Eric Kohn of Indiewire wrote that showing Ellul's essay being read off of a smart phone [...] "portrays the information age as the dying breath of consciousness before intellectual thought becomes homogenized by digital advancements" [...] and that the film [...] "suggests humankind has grown limited by devices <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> everything we think we need to know." ...|$|E

60|$|The term {{of mercy}} {{is but a}} general sound, and is as an arrow shot at rovers, unless the blood and death of the Son of God be set before us, as the mark or mean by which our spirits are to be {{directed}} to it. What profit shall a man have, and what shelter or succour shall he find, in hearing of the most exact relation {{of the strength of}} the most impregnable castle in the world, unless he knows the door, and entereth in by that, into that place of strength, in the time when the enemy shall pursue him? Why, this is the case: We hear a noise of mercy, and of being at peace with God; what a good God, God is, and what a blessed thing {{it is to be a}} child of God; how many privileges the children of God have, and what will be their exaltation and glory in the next world! And all the while they <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> these things conceal from us the way thereto, which is Christ, not in the naming of him, but in the right administration of his gospel to us.|$|E
60|$|For {{the present}} we shall remain in this queer old walled town, with its crooked, narrow lanes, <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> {{of their old}} day that knew no wheeled vehicles; its plaster-and-timber dwellings, with upper stories far {{overhanging}} the street, and thus marking their date, say three hundred years ago; the stately city walls, the castellated gates, the ivy-grown, foliage-sheltered, most noble and picturesque ruin of St. Mary's Abbey, suggesting their date, say five hundred years ago, {{in the heart of}} Crusading times and the glory of English chivalry and romance; the vast Cathedral of York, with its worn carvings and quaintly pictured windows, preaching of still remoter days; the outlandish names of streets and courts and byways that stand as a record and a memorial, all these centuries, of Danish dominion here in still earlier times; the hint here and there of King Arthur and his knights and their bloody fights with Saxon oppressors round about this old city more than thirteen hundred years gone by; and, last of all, the melancholy old stone coffins and sculptured inscriptions, a venerable arch and a hoary tower of stone that still remain and are kissed by the sun and caressed by the shadows every day, just as the sun and the shadows have kissed and caressed them every lagging day since the Roman Emperor's soldiers placed them here in the times when Jesus the Son of Mary walked the streets of Nazareth a youth, with no more name or fame than the Yorkshire boy who is loitering down this street this moment.|$|E
60|$|Oh how men {{hate that}} message!--the {{message that the}} true wrath of God, necessary, inevitable, is {{revealed}} from heaven against all unrighteousness of men. How they writhe under it! How they shut their ears to it, and cry to their preachers, 'No! Tell us of any wrath of God but <b>that!</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> rather of the torments of the damned, of a frowning God, of absolute decrees to destruction, of the reprobation of millions before they are born; any doctrine, however fearful and horrible: because we don't quite believe it, but only think {{that we ought to}} believe it. Yes, tell us anything rather than that news, which cuts at the root of all our pride, of all our comfort, and all our superstition--the news that we cannot escape the consequences of our own actions; that there are no back stairs up which we may be smuggled into heaven; that as we sow, so we shall reap; that we are filled with the fruits of our own devices; every man his own poisoner, every man his own executioner, every man his own suicide; that hell begins in this life, and death begins before we die: --do not say that: because we cannot help believing it; for our own consciousness and our own experience tell us it is true.' No wonder that the preacher who tells men that is hated, is called a Rationalist, a Pantheist, a heretic, and what not, just because he does set forth such a living God, such a justice of God, such a wrath of God as would make the sinner tremble, if he believed in it, not merely once in a way, when he hears a stirring sermon about the endless torments: but all day long, going out and coming in, lying on his bed and walking by the way, always haunted by the shadow of himself, knowing that he is bearing about in him the perpetually growing death of sin.|$|E
60|$|If you do not, I must {{remind you}} of the song, which, St. Luke says, the shepherds in Judaea heard the angels sing, on this night 1851 years ago. <b>That</b> song <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> the meaning of that babe's coming. <b>That</b> song <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> what <b>that</b> babe's coming {{had to do with}} the poor slaves of Rome, and with all poor creatures who have {{suffered}} and sorrowed on this earth, before or since.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{her belief}} {{that it is the}} media <b>that</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> how to live, Joan Didion has become an {{observer}} of journalists themselves.
