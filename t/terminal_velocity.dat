5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E

Several recent movies have been filmed, at least in part, in Flagstaff. A small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, the city was also referenced in the film. Several of the running scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed {{in and around the}} area, including a memorable scene where Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer ("Shit happens").

5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

25|$|As {{the speed}} of an object increases, so does the drag force acting on it, which also depends on the {{substance}} it is passing through (for example air or water). At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will equal the gravitational pull on the object (buoyancy is considered below). At this point the object ceases to accelerate and continues falling at a constant speed called the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> (also called settling velocity). An object moving downward faster than the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> (for example because it was thrown downwards, it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere, or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity.</b> Drag depends on the projected area, here, the object's cross-section or silhouette in a horizontal plane. An object with a large projected area relative to its mass, such as a parachute, has a lower <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity</b> than one with a small projected area relative to its mass, such as a bullet.|$|E

25|$|His work is {{the basis}} of the falling sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is {{stationary}} in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity,</b> which can be measured by {{the time it takes to}} pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the <b>terminal</b> <b>velocity,</b> the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe sound generated by rainfall at sea {{is caused by}} raindrops {{of a wide range}} of sizes and angles of incidence, which fall at their <b>terminal</b> <b>velocities.</b> The purpose of this laboratory research has been to make complete acoustical measurements of the sound generated by single water drops striking the water surface at their <b>terminal</b> <b>velocities</b> for normal and oblique incidence. These measurements have included the total acoustic energy, peak axial pressure, frequency spectrum and polar radiation pattern. Depending on the drop size and the angle of incidence, many drops falling at their <b>terminal</b> <b>velocities</b> create bubbles. At all angles of incidence studied here the sound radiated by an individual bubble contains more energy than the sound from an individual impact. These results, using <b>terminal</b> <b>velocities</b> and oblique trajectories, are very different from the published normal incidence, non-terminal velocity characterizations. For example bubble frequencies other than the well known 14 kHz peak are found. Also the energy of the impact sound increases significantly for larger drop sizes and for larger deviations from normal trajectories. Furthermore, drops of diameter 0. 8 mm to I mm, which always produce bubbles at normal incidence, create bubbles only about 10 % of the impacts at oblique incidence. These observations provide specific reasons for the previously unexplained broadening, shifting and reduction in magnitude of the 14 kHz spectral peak of the rain noise in the presence of winds at sea.
