Four South African wine exporting companies participated in this study by providing information through email and telephone interviews. Results indicated that South African wineries emphasize the country of origin information in all marketing communications activities and especially through <b>wine</b> product attributes. <b>The</b> origin of <b>wine</b> is highlighted in packaging and labeling as a mandatory requirement in most <b>wine</b> importing countries. <b>The</b> most common label on packaging appears as ‘____South Africa’. Most wine exporters also use the country’s biodiversity information and ethical work standards to convey positive information to foreign consumers about <b>the</b> country’s <b>wine</b> industry. There was no generalization that country of origin information severely affected wines sales in foreign markets. This was in exception to the US market, where promotion activities need to be reviewed and enhanced. Furthermore, South African wine low market value was more associated with the high bulk export volumes. Participating wineries considered the country’s image abroad to be more important than their own individual brands.

Future research can focus on how <b>the</b> South African <b>wine</b> industry can increase their brand awareness for premium wine brands in export markets.

He used his own foundry store’s relationship to establish a top Italian wine brand, acquired a winery in Italy, and used direct sales from the winery to import it to China. In 2010 ZY established a wine company in Shanghai, and has invited Italian consulate personnel and business contacts {{to participate in}} wine tasting and other promotional activities there.

However, the success on the market changes dramatically among firms, production areas, types of <b>wine,</b> etc. <b>The</b> paper presents main features of Italian wine market with special attention to strategies adopted by firms along <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> supply chain, <b>the</b> enforcement of Vqprd <b>wine</b> system, <b>the</b> impact of promotion strategies on international <b>wine</b> market. <b>The</b> methodology for <b>wine</b> market analysis has been firstly figured out. The market theory about monopolistic competition or oligopoly power cannot fully explain <b>the</b> dynamic of <b>wine</b> sector over {{time as well as}} the features and behavior of wine firms. Thus, approaches based on strategic groups or Porter’s cluster competitiveness seem to fit better what has happed in <b>wine</b> sector. <b>The</b> role of <b>wine</b> sector goes beyond the market involving a strategic role on the territory, especially in marginal areas, on the environment (e. g. landscape), on the tourism (e. g. enotourism). Peculiarities of Italian wine market have also emphasized at both supply and demand side showing factors which driving and affecting <b>the</b> features of <b>wine</b> firms. This analysis has figured out a quick response of wine companies to consumer preference changes at both national and international level. Market trends such as the increasing in Vqprd <b>wines,</b> <b>the</b> shift from draft to bottled <b>wines</b> or <b>the</b> strong increase in price differentiation and quality have been boosted by the innovation processes in grape production, wine making, supply chain arrangements and marketing activities about product (e. g. packaging), communication and distribution channels. Further the strategic analysis has been focused on two key aspects: the role played by Consortia in reinforcing the reputation of collective brands such as docg/doc <b>wines</b> and <b>the</b> effect of <b>wine</b> <b>promotion</b> in extra ue countries. Recently, the role of Consortia has been reviewed. The institutional task about controls over grape and wine production has been shifted to private and independent agencies while new arrangements have been set up. Among them the control over supply and policy actions at consumer level. Other traditional activities such as the protection of collective brands on international markets and the promotion have been reinforced, especially on Consortia involving a high share of producers, since financial support is now afforded by all producers regardless their membership to the Consortium. However, only a few Consortia are able to carry out these activities since many of them have a low representativeness. The case of Prosecco Consortium is then presented showing the effect of the reform of denomination of origin which has restricted the use of Prosecco to docg/doc areas only.

Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire with 27 single choice or scoring questions and a set of 13 best–worst (BW) scaling questions is designed. Typical consumers in supermarkets and university students are invited to answer the questionnaire which uses a mix of nominal and rating scale responses as well as a BW choice experiment. Findings – The results show that the consumers intend to pay low prices for daily use wines, but high prices for wines for gift purposes. Domestic brands constituted the highest proportion of the purchases, followed by French <b>wines.</b> <b>The</b> consumers are sensitive on price and country of wine origin; awards, medals, and vintage were of low influences in wine purchasing decisions. Typical consumers like supermarkets and boutique wine shops, while university students prefer the internet for on-line sales.
