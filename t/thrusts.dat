40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} test the {{feasibility}} of a new <b>thrust</b> stand system based on impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement method, a liquid-fueled pulse detonation engine (PDE) is designed and built. <b>Thrust</b> performance of the engine is obtained by direct <b>thrust</b> measurement with a force transducer and indirect <b>thrust</b> measurement with an eddy current displacement sensor (ECDS). These two sets of <b>thrust</b> data are compared {{with each other to}} verify the accuracy of the <b>thrust</b> performance. Then <b>thrust</b> data measured by the new <b>thrust</b> stand system are compared with the verified <b>thrust</b> data to test its feasibility. The results indicate that <b>thrust</b> data from the force transducer and ECDS system are consistent with each other within the range of measurement error. Though the <b>thrust</b> data from the impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement system is a litter lower than that from the force transducer due to the axial momentum losses of the detonation jet, the impulse <b>thrust</b> measurement method is valid when applied to measure the averaged <b>thrust</b> of PDE. Analytical models of PDE are also discussed in this paper. The analytical <b>thrust</b> performance is higher than the experimental data due to ignoring the losses during the deflagration to detonation transition process. Effect of equivalence ratio on the engine <b>thrust</b> performance is investigated by utilizing the modified analytical model. <b>Thrust</b> reaches maximum at the equivalence ratio of about 1. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Target-type <b>thrust</b> reversal, {{particularly}} this design, {{was invented}} in 1968. This invention is stated to be an improvement to previous design.

40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative <b>thrust</b> reverser concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines.

The innovative <b>thrust</b> reverser configurations consisted of a cascade <b>thrust</b> reverser with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless <b>thrust</b> reverser, two core-mounted target <b>thrust</b> reversers, a multi-door crocodile <b>thrust</b> reverser, and a wing-mounted <b>thrust</b> reverser.

5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways <b>thrusts</b> of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E

It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation.

5000|$|Naturally, as {{altitude}} increases, {{there is}} a decrease in air density and, therefore, the net <b>thrust</b> of an engine.

The impact of <b>thrust</b> lapse rate upon a low specific <b>thrust</b> (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe.
