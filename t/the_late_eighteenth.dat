5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E

5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are {{a group of about}} 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, Roman sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. It dates to the second century CE {{and may have been}} looted from a Roman {{monument}} further to the south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E
5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> {{and early}} nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
25|$|Tomotley (also {{known as}} Tamahli) is a pre{{historic}} and historic Native American site in Monroe County, Tennessee, {{in the southeastern}} United States. Occupied {{as early as the}} Archaic period, the Tomotley site had the most substantial periods of habitation during the Mississippian period, likely when the earthwork mounds were built, and later during <b>the</b> mid to <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century as a refugee village of Cherokee from the Lower, Middle and Valley towns.|$|R
50|$|Coldham Cottage itself {{dates from}} <b>the</b> <b>late</b> seventeenth/early <b>eighteenth</b> century {{and has a}} timber-frame, {{whitewashed}} and rendered, with pantile roof and brick central ridge and right end projecting stacks. Until 1868 the priest officiated in the chapel at Coldham Hall but after {{the sale of the}} estate in that year a separate church was built utilising one unit of the existing house (kitchen and bedroom with removal of floor) and building on an extension. The whole represents an unusual and rare instance of continuing Catholic use from at least the eighteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|The word hoax {{became popular}} in <b>the</b> middle to <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. It {{is thought to}} have come from the saying 'hocus pocus'. Hocus pocus means {{meaningless}} talk which is typically designed to trick others or conceal the truth about a situation. It is thought to be derived from a conjuror in the time of King James who called himself 'The Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus', where he would perform a trick and call out a phrase beginning with [...] "hocus pocus".|$|R
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century Scotland gained {{many of the}} organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time}} as the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Highly distinctive, male lions {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their manes, and the male's face {{is one of}} the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E

50|$|Suriname {{has one of}} {{the most}} ethnically diverse populations in South America, with groups of ethnic East Indian, Indonesian, Chinese, European, Amerindian and African (Creole and Maroon) origin. The Maroons' {{ancestors}} were African slaves who escaped from coastal Suriname between <b>the</b> mid-seventeenth and <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> centuries to form independent settlements in the interior. They settled in interior parts of Suriname, and gained independence by signing a peace treaty with the Dutch in the 1760s. The Dutch were unable to conquer them and agreed to allow them autonomy within their territory.|$|R
50|$|With the {{concurrence}} of the British government, the U.S., in 1873, built a consulate on Shamian Island, a sandy one kilometer {{long strip}} of land around which a man-made canal had been dug ten years before to separate it {{from the rest of}} the city. Along with their European counterparts, foreign diplomatic personnel tried to recreate a Western lifestyle. They built Anglican and Catholic churches, tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, and long promenades. Today, visitors to Shamian Island can still see <b>the</b> vestiges of <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century and nineteenth century Western life.|$|R
5|$|John and Alexander Runciman both gained reputations as {{painters}} of mythological and historical themes. They travelled to Italy, where they worked with Hamilton. John died in 1768/9 and Alexander returned home. His most widely known work, distributed in etchings, was mythological. His version of The Origin of Painting (1773), depicting Pliny's {{story of a}} young Corinthian woman outlining a shadow on the wall, has her hand guided by Cupid, suggesting the ultimate motivation for art was love. The same theme was painted by another of Hamilton's proteges, David Allan, two years later. In <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century Ossian became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works were undertaken by Alexander Runciman and David Allan among others.|$|E
5|$|Neoclassicism was {{pioneered by}} Gavin Hamilton and his proteges, the {{brothers}} John and Alexander Runciman, and David Allan. Alexander Runciman pioneered historical painting and Alan helped develop genre art, {{both of which}} would be taken up by Scottish artists in the next century. After the Acts of Union in 1707 there was very little patronage for large and expensive works of art in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary and the portrait bust also became popular. Commissions of new statuary tended to be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. From <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century there are a handful of examples of work from Scottish artists.|$|E
5|$|The Nanjakana {{compound}} is {{the most}} highly elevated of the three compounds in the rova at Ambohimanga. Located to the northeast of Mahandrinoro, this compound {{is believed to have}} been first constructed by Andrianjafy in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. To the north of the compound is a stone esplanade that offers a clear view of the surrounding areas where Andrianampoinimerina reportedly came to reflect on his military strategy for bringing Imerina under his control. During the 1861 funeral of Queen Ranavalona I held in the Nanjakana compound, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three of the compound's historic royal residences.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Canadian militia and France's Amerindian allies, the Troupes de la Marine were {{essential}} to the defence of New France in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> centuries. With the arrival {{of large numbers of}} British regulars after 1755, the nature of warfare in North America shifted from irregular to conventional European warfare, with particular importance attached to sieges and fortifications. French army battalions were also dispatched to fight in North America after 1755.|$|R
5000|$|Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677), in his 1670 Theologico-Political Treatise, criticized Judaism (his birth religion) and all {{organized}} religion. His philosophical {{orientation is}} often called [...] "pantheism," [...] a term coined by John Toland after Spinoza's death. However, in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> seventeenth and <b>eighteenth</b> centuries, Spinoza's name was often associated with atheism, freethinking, materialism, deism, and any other heterodox religious belief. Whether or not [...] "pantheism" [...] constitutes atheism is still debated by modern scholars.|$|R
5000|$|Haldenby Grange is a Grade II listed farmhouse, {{dating from}} <b>the</b> middle to <b>late</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. It is built of red-brown brick, with later {{alterations}} in a lighter-coloured brick, {{and has a}} pantiled roof. It was once close to {{the banks of the}} River Don, and formed part of the deserted medieval village of Haldenby. The village continued to the north-east, as far as Haldenby Hall, another listed building which dates from <b>the</b> <b>late</b> seventeenth century, altered in the mid-nineteenth century. It is [...] "T"-shaped in plan, built from bricks in different colours, and with pantiles and Welsh slate roofs. It replaced the medieval Haldenby Hall, once the residence of the Haldenby family, who are commemorated by monuments in the church at Adlingfleet. Close to Haldenby Grange is a listed barn and horse mill.|$|R
