2500|$|After the {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912, Navratil placed Michel and Edmond in Collapsible D, the last lifeboat successfully launched from the ship. Michel, although not quite {{four years old}} at the time, later claimed to remember his father telling him, [...] "My child, when your mother comes for you, as she surely will, tell her that I loved her dearly and still do. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> expected her to follow us, so that we might all live happily together in the peace and freedom of the New World." [...] The elder Navratil died in the sinking, and his body was recovered by the rescue ship, Mackay-Bennett. In his pocket was a revolver. Because of his assumed Jewish surname, he was buried in Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax, a Jewish cemetery in Nova Scotia.|$|E
6000|$|He got up {{from his}} chair again and looked away out of the window, while Dinah stood with {{compassionate}} patience. In a minute or two he turned round and said, [...] "I will come, Dinah...to-morrow morning...if it must be. I may have more strength to bear it, if I know it must be. <b>Tell</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> forgive her; <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> will come--at the very last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{does not}} understand,' said Siegmund to himself. 'And {{whatever}} I do I must not <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> {{should have thought}} she would understand.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{impatient}} attendant scolds <b>her,</b> <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{am not in}} mourning, bids {{her look}} again, tries to rouse her.|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. When {{that lady}} calls, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> am not {{expected}} home this evening. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> have been suddenly called out of town. You understand? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I left a {{note for}} your step-mother <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had gone to America for a vacation. Jimmy, I hate to think what she's {{going to do to}} me when she gets me back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I should <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't {{express it}} in that way. I should say it's because there's {{something}} of the 'people' in her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't--I can't!" [...] he stammered. [...] "I--I--I'm a {{long way}} off, and I have {{important}} work to do. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> will come to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> didn't reproach you {{and never}} thought of such a thing. And I said I would break open my letter and say so.|$|E
60|$|At that I gripped my wife's arm, {{and without}} {{ceremony}} ran her {{out into the}} road. Then I fetched out the servant, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you like}} I'll come with you," [...] said Mr. Wotton. [...] "I ain't {{got nothing to}} do. <b>I</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>'er</b> <b>I</b> was cast away with you if you liked. Anything to help a pal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> say. He, however, {{would listen}} to nothing. Then I assured him that no {{consideration}} on earth would induce me to surrender <b>her,</b> and that <b>I</b> was as sure of <b>her</b> as <b>I</b> am of myself. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> that;--and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> think she owes it to me to say one word to me before she goes into the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} does not, you young fool," [...] {{retorted}} Percy lightly. [...] "If {{you try and}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> think I would smash your head." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. Then do <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{want to talk}} to her particularly. I {{have been}} waiting here all the morning to see either her or Robert.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} would care much, Bellamy, if you stayed away all night. But look here, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{want to see her}} to-morrow; don't forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{lady who}} helps him--Mr. Flack has told me so," [...] the girl continued. [...] "She's a {{literary}} lady--here in Paris--she writes what he <b>tells</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>her</b> name's Miss Topping, but she calls herself Florine--or Dorine," [...] Francie added.|$|R
5000|$|Please <b>Tell</b> <b>Her</b> That <b>I</b> Said Hello - (Michael Shepstone, Peter Dibbens) - 3:29 ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. You are right. What could I know of such things? Don't let us talk {{any more}} about it--as for telling my {{daughter}} who I am, that I do not allow. It is my secret, it is not yours. If I {{make up my mind}} to <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>I</b> think I will, <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> before <b>I</b> leave the house--if not, <b>I</b> shall never <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, one to my laundress to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{shall be}} there to-morrow, {{and one to}} Mary Snow to say that I'll see her the day after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andy," [...] {{said his}} mistress, [...] "step to Eliza's door, and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> have rung for her three times. Poor thing!" [...] she added, to herself, with a sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may believe}} it; indeed you may." [...] He still held her hand. [...] "You will write {{to your mother}} I daresay to-night. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was here. Good-by now." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{one thing}} I was determined. If Bertha should ever again be brought {{near enough to}} hear me, <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> loved <b>her.</b> The object of life, however much of it might be left me, should be to make Bertha know that <b>I</b> loved <b>her.</b> If <b>I</b> swam toward the vessel, or floated on a plank, I must get near enough to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> loved <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Like it! I could {{scarcely}} find words to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how <b>I</b> should like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Dobbin," [...] he said, {{rubbing his}} eyes with his knuckles, [...] "I was just--just <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> would. And, O Sir, she's so dam kind to me." [...] The water pumps were at work again, and I {{am not sure that}} the soft-hearted Captain's eyes did not also twinkle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to see your {{mistress}} before I go," [...] Deane said firmly. [...] "Please go and <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> will not detain her {{more than a few}} moments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is mamma?" [...] {{repeated}} Henrietta, gazing {{round and}} seeing {{no one but}} Mrs. Langford and Bennet. [...] "Was she frightened at my being ill? <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> am better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, don't call her, don't <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> {{shall be}} better soon. Lie {{down here and}} 'poor' my head. I'll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chester was amused, and I thought I {{might as}} well <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how <b>I</b> came to be delayed {{on the road and}} so caught in the storm, and I related my {{experience}} with Miss Burton. I would have been glad to go still farther back and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how <b>I</b> came to take the school at Walford, and anything else she might care to listen to.|$|R
60|$|Arim. <b>Tell</b> <b>her,</b> that <b>I</b> some {{certainty}} may bring, I go {{this minute}} {{to attend the}} king.|$|R
60|$|MARCHBANKS (turning {{near the}} door). Either {{the truth or}} a lie you MUST <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> if <b>I</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{will take}} her," [...] said Ralph. [...] "Will {{you ask her}} to get ready? <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shall be at the door in ten or fifteen minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed we do! If Rose ever {{speaks of}} him to you, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shall see that he comes to no harm, and she must {{do the same for}} my Archie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now Geoffrey your hand, {{and when}} the next wave ebbs let us follow it. If we are parted and you see her first <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> remembered, and give her this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon ye {{can hang}} out with me, 'f ye feel like ut. We ain't very purty, ol' woman an' me, but we eat. You go along {{down the road and}} <b>tell</b> <b>'er</b> <b>I</b> sent yeh. Y'll find an' ol' dusty Bible round some'rs--I s'pose ye spend y'r spare time read'n about Joshua an' Dan'l"---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No--no,' growled Mr. Barkis, {{reflecting}} about it. 'I ain't got no call {{to go and}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so. <b>I</b> {{never said}} six words to <b>her</b> myself, <b>I</b> ain't a-goin' to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} about the dangers. The chances are that when <b>I</b> see <b>her</b> Grace <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> think about her." ...|$|R
