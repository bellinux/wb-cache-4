25|$|Did the Gymnasium boost {{students}} ability? There {{are different}} opinions about this. Some {{argue that this}} is the cases and even after testing performance in grade four, those who were admitted to a Gymnasium outperformed their peers who were not at grade six. That was also the interpretation of Prof. Dr. Dr. Lehman, who did the study. He stated: The findings indicate that the Gymnasium help students of all social classes reach their full mathematical potential. Others however, who have reanalized the data, claimed that those attending a Gymnasium were different ab initio and could not properly be compared to those attending a primary school. The data is of high political relevance as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> favour of the tripartite system and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> favour of comprehensive schools both use it to prove their point. <b>Those,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> favour of comprehensive schools, claim that the data shows that the primary schools which resembles a comprehensive schools boost children's ability, while those in favour of the tripartite system argue that the data shows the Gymnasium boost students ability.|$|E

25|$|In The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy, Christopher Lasch {{analyzes}} the widening {{gap between the}} top and bottom of the social composition in the United States.

According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.|$|E

If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand {{citizens can}} apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK.

25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E
