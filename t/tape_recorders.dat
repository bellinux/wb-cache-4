The film was then re-released in 1974 with additional studio material of the band working on The Dark Side of the Moon, and interviews at Abbey Road Studios.|$|E

5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, the {{gameplay}} emphasizes {{horror and}} exploration over action. The inventory uses a grid-based system {{with an initial}} capacity of 12 slots, but may be expanded several times {{over the course of}} the game. An item can occupy up to two spaces, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad. Item boxes found in save rooms may also be used to manage and store items for later use, and be retrieved from different item boxes. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, or combined with other items to increase their usefulness. Many of the game's puzzles require that items be examined under certain conditions in order to reveal secrets. <b>Tape</b> <b>recorders</b> can be used to manually save the game's progress, which depending on the given difficulty level, may require the use of a cassette tape. Videotapes are scattered for Ethan to find, which place the player in the perspective of a different character, oftentimes revealing plot information or clues needed to solve a puzzle.|$|E

5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Clarence and Ruby Moore {{began by}} modifying {{existing}} makes and models of <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> {{to make them}} more rugged. In 1949, Moore obtained a groundbreaking patent, the first tape recorder with a built-in power amplifier for public address duties, which was introduced in 1950. In 1953, Crown added a line of compact loudspeakers as accessories to the reel to reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During this period, {{members of}} the <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> club came to the {{conclusion}} that the radio work was now starting to take over from the original purpose of the <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorder</b> Club.

25|$|Kornél Tolnai assumed already invented wire {{players and}} {{developed}} the design. Some companies were {{known for their}} excellent quality reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders,</b> i.e. Tandberg and Revox. Tandberg is a manufacturer of videoconferencing systems, located in Oslo, Norway (product development, sales and distribution) and New York City, United States (sales and distribution). Tandberg Radiofabrikk is now owned by LM Ericsson and the factories manufactured radios, computer equipment, language laboratories, television, <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and stereo equipment. Tandberg built during the 50- and 60-century a global reputation {{in the fields of}} radio, television and <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> In the 1950s and 1960s was Tandberg's tape recorder to be among the best. The magnetic tape which was in use in 1950s-1970s was 7-inch reel 1⁄4-inch-wide audio recording tapes, which were the prevalent and typical of consumer use. ReVox is a brand name of Swiss audio equipment created by Studer in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|The final scene, {{in which}} Morris and Harris are only heard, while shots of a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> appear from various angles, was not {{originally}} planned.

25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Kornél Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and later on video <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|E
25|$|Inexpensive reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> {{were widely}} used for voice {{recording}} {{in the home}} and in schools before the Philips compact cassette, introduced in 1963, gradually took over. Cassettes eventually displaced reel-to-reel recorders for consumer use.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape sound recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> Development of magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E
