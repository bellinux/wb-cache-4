40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC x GC) analysis has {{the capability to}} resolve many more components of complex mixtures than traditional single column GC analysis. There is an increasing need to provide reliable identification of these separated components; time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) is the most appropriate technology to achieve this task. Rather than require MS for all GC x GC separations, it is desirable to assign peak identities to specific peak positions in the GC x GC separation space, and this necessitates matching peak retentions in the two experiments - GC x GC-FID and GC x GC-TOFMS. The atmospheric vs. vacuum outlet conditions confound this task. It is shown here that by employing a supplementary gas supply, provided to a <b>T-union</b> between the column outlet and the MS interface, {{it is possible to}} generate 2 D chromatograms for GCxGC-FID and GC x GC-TOFMS that are essentially exactly matched. There is no degradation in separation performance or efficiency in the second column in the system interfaced to the <b>T-union.</b> Since the GC x GC-FID experiment uses hydrogen for maximum efficiency, and GC x GC-TOFMS uses helium carrier, translation of (conditions/retentions) must account for the different viscosities of the carrier gases. Translation of conditions is based on well-known principles established in single column analysis. Tabulated data illustrate that retention reproducibility was of the order of better than 4 s for the average first dimension retention difference, and about 40 ms for the average second dimension retention difference when comparing GCxGC-FID and GC x GC-TOFMS results. This should provide considerable support for identification in routine GC x GC-FID analysis of specific sample types, once the peaks in 2 D separation space have been assigned identities through GC x GC-TOFMS analysis...|$|E

The average {{size of the}} primary particles was in the range 5 - 30 nm. The influence of the flow conditions {{as well as the}} composition of the starting material on the dispersion properties was investigated. A new Raman spectroscopic measurement setup was used for the characterization {{of the structure of the}} nanoparticles in dispersed form. The use of differential centrifugal sedimentation for the determination of the size distribution of the dispersed particles proved to be convenient and powerful to determine the influence of the investigated parameters on the dispersion properties.

The objective is to schedule a subset of non-conflicting jobs of maximum total weight. In a single machine environment, our problem can be formulated as the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a t-interval graph (the special case of t = 1 is an ordinary interval graph). We show that, for t * 2, this problem is APX-hard, even for highly restricted instances. Our main result is a 2 tapproximation algorithm for general instances, based on a novel fractional version of the Local Ratio technique. Previously, the problem was considered only for proper union graphs, a restricted subclass of t-interval graphs, and the approximation factor achieved was (2 t Î“ 1 + 1 = 2 t). A bi-criteria polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) is developed for the subclass of <b>t-union</b> graphs. In the online case, we consider uniform weight jobs that consist of at most two segments. We show that when the resulting 2 -interval graph is proper, a simple greedy algorithm is 3 -competitive, while any randomized algorithm has competitive ratio at least 2 : 5...|$|E
