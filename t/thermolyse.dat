Pour l'identification indirecte des molécules à courte durée de vie, nous avons utilisé la caractérisation spectrale "classique" de leurs produits issus du piégeage chimique. Le suivi direct des produits de la décomposition thermique des différents précurseurs judicieusement choisis a été effectué à l'aide du tandem <b>thermolyse</b> éclair - spectroscopie photoélectronique à rayonnement UV. L'interprétation spectrale a été entreprise sur la base d'une évaluation quantique des potentiels d'ionisation (HF : OVGF/ 6 - 311 G(d,p); DFT:B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p); potentiels d'ionisation "corrigés"). La mise en évidence du réarrangement de Schönberg-Newman-Kwart, comme première étape de la décomposition thermique des dérivés du 4 H- 3, 1 -benzoxatin- 4 thione, a été confirmée également dans le cas de la <b>thermolyse</b> éclair du 3 H-izobenzofuran- 1 thione. L'augmentation progressive de la température {{a conduit}} successivement à l'élimination du thioformaldéhyde et à la formation de la thiobenzopropiolactone, puis à son isomère "ouvert" le 6 -thioxocyclohexa- 2, 4 -dienylideneketene. Au-delà de 700 C, le départ du CO <b>thermolyse</b> éclair du 4 H- 1, 3 -benzodithiin- 4 thione, le phenanthro[9, 10 -c]- 1, 2 -di-thiète et le 3 H- 1, 2 -benzodithiole- 3 -thione ont été formés. Le mécanisme de cette transformation, avec le thiobenzopropiothionolactone comme intermédiaire, a été proposé sur la base d'observations spectrales et d'une étude théorique. The main {{goal of this}} work, was to synthesize and study the electronic structure of 6 -thioxocyclohexa- 2, 4 -dienylidenethioketene (or, its open form-thiobenzopropiothionolactone) obtained using Flash Vacuum Thermolysis (FVT) method. Two different approach for identification of this highly reactive intermediate has been applied. First, the chemical trapping on a "cold finger" wiht classical spectral characterization has been carried out. Second, the FVT oven inside the UV-photoelectron spectroscopy apparatus {{has been used to}} the direct follow-up of thermal decomposition of different precursors judiciously selected. For all stating compounds, as well as for products and transients, quantum calculations of ionization potentials by three different methods (OVGF/ 6 - 311 G(d,p); DFT: B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) and so-colled "corrected" IP) after full geometrical parameters optimisation have been performed. In the case of 4 H- 3, 1 -benzoxatin- 4 -thione analogs the Schönberg-Newman-Kwart rearrangement has been evidenced as a first step of FVT transformation and confirmed by the thermolysis of 3 H- izobenzofuran- 1 -thione analog in the independent experiments. Increasing of the temperature to 650 resulted in the elimination of thioformaldehyde molecule and formation of thiobenzopropiolactone. Subsequent elevation of the temperature prompted presumably the cleavage of the latter to its open isomer 6 -thioxocyclohexa- 2, 4 -dienylideneketene (at 680), which in higher temperature (700) eliminated the CO molecule and underwent a Wolff-type ring contraction to 6 - fulvenethione. Flash vacuum thermolysis of 4 H- 1, 3 -benzodithiin- 4 -thione resulted in the formation of phenanthro[9, 10 -c]- 1, 2 -dithiete and 3 H- 1, 2 -benzo-dithiole- 3 -thione. The mecanism of this reaction includind the formation of thiobenzopropiothionolactone as an intermediate has been postulated. PAU-BU Sciences (644452103) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

In this dissertation, the acid-free synthesis of cyanoform by an absolutely new approach has been discussed. Generation of the elusive molecule, cyanoform from the photolysis and thermolysis of 2 -(azidomethylidene) malononitrile, has been confirmed at very low temperatures by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, 15 N NMR, and the relevant 2 D NMR spectroscopic techniques. Moreover, it has been proved that cyanoform is relatively stable, but can be detected only below – 85 oC, and not at high temperatures (at – 45 oC, as has been reported in literature), because of a rapid equilibration with an another species. Furthermore, the chemistry of cyanoform in the ring enlargement reactions with various highly strained epoxides, azirines, and aziridines, via the highly reactive dicyanoketenimine intermediate, as well as its Michael addition reactions with different α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been well explored. In addition, the synthesis of N 1 -substituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles and study of their rearrangement to the corresponding N 2 -substituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles, under thermal and nucleophile-catalyzed reaction conditions, has been well investigated. Cyanoform (Tricyanomethan) ist eine der stärksten in der Literatur beschriebenen organischen Kohlenstoffsäuren, welche sich seit 120 Jahren einer erfolgreichen Synthese und Isolierung entzogen hat.

Diese Nanopartikel bilden den Kern des Erbgut-Trägers und werden mittels Layer-by-Layer –Verfahren (LbL) mit geladenen Polymeren, den bioabbaubaren Makromolekülen Poly-L-Lysin und Heparin, beschichtet. Dafür wird zunächst eine geeignete Apparatur aufgebaut. Diese wird zur Herstellung von Kern-Schale-Strukturen mit fünf Polyelektrolytschichten {{verwendet}} und liefert Partikel mit einem hydrodynamischen Durchmesser von 58 nm, die bei Abwesenheit von niedermolekularem Salz aggregatfrei sind. Das System wird gegen Salz stabilisiert, indem die letzte Poly-L-Lysin-Schicht mit Polyethylenglycol modifiziert wird. Die so entstandenen Multischalenpartikel zeigen weder im PBS-Puffer noch in humanem Serum Aggregation. Mittels winkelabhängiger dynamischer Lichtstreuung wird die Aggregatbildung kontrolliert, während ζ-Potential-Messungen die Kontrolle der Oberflächenladung erlauben. rnDa siRNA auf Grund ihres negativ geladenen Phosphat-Rückgrats ebenfalls ein Polyelektrolyt ist, wird sie aggregatfrei auf die positiv geladenen PLL-Nanopartikel aufgetragen.

Jedoch sind die entstandenen Komplexe mittels Fluoreszenzkorrelations-spektroskopie (FCS) nicht nachweisbar.

Magnetic, negatively charged iron oxide nanoparticles (d = 17 nm) are synthesized via thermal decomposition and transferred into water. They form the core of the gene carrier system and are coated with charged and biodegradable polymers like poly-L-lysine and heparin. First, a device is designed for this layer-by-layer assembly. This device is then used to synthesize core-shell structures with five polyelectrolyte layers, which have a hydrodynamic diameter around 58 nm and are aggregation-free in the absence of low-molecular salt. To stabilize the system, the last poly-L-lysine layer is modified wit polyethylene glycol. The developed multilayer particles show no aggregation in PBS-buffer or human serum. Possible aggregation is monitored by angle-dependent dynamic light scattering, whereas the surface charge is controlled via ζ-potential measurement. rnBecause of the negatively charged phosphate backbone, siRNA is also a polyelectrolyte. Therefore it is coated onto positive charged PLL-nanoparticles without the occurrence of aggregation. For detection in vitro the siRNA is fluorochrome labeled. However, the resulting complexes cannot be detected via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Next, the PEGylated outer layer of the synthesized particles is fluorescent labeled by copper-free click chemistry. The corresponding multilayer particles are also not detectable with FCS, therefore possible quenching effects can be assumed. rnr...|$|E
40|$|Dieses Forschungsprojekt befasst sich mit dem Studium der Chemie des endo-Tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidens, das im Endergebnis als ein „foiled carbene“ klassifiziert werden konnte. Obwohl die Umlagerungsreaktionen dieses Carbens bereits vorher untersucht worden waren, sollte seine Klassifizierung als ein „foiled carbene“ nun gründlicher durch Überprüfung seiner Stereoselektivität in intermolekularen Reaktionen bestimmt werden. Die besetzten Walshorbitale des endo-verknüpften Dreirings geben Elektronen in das leere p-Orbital des Carbenzentrums. Dies bewirkt dass die Brücke, die den divalenten Kohlenstoff enthält, sich zum Cyclopropanring hinneigt. Es wurde erwartet, dass die verwendeten Substrate sich dem Dreiring von der anti–Seite nähern sollten, wo aufgrund der Neigung der Brücke mehr Platz zur Verfügung steht. Eine Oxadiazolin Carbenvorstufe wurde synthetisiert und die nachfolgende Erzeugung des entsprechenden Carbens durch <b>Thermolyse</b> oder Photolyse induziert. endo-Tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -yliden wurde stereoselektiv mit Acrylnitril, Diethylamin, Benzaldehyd und Acetophenon abgefangen. Bei Durchführung der Reaktionen in Cyclohexan und Cyclohexen wurden jedoch Isomerisierungsreaktionen des Carbens favorisiert. Die Reaktionsträgheit mit der elektronenreichen Doppelbindung des Cyclohexens spricht für die Nucleophilie des endo-Tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidens. Darüberhinaus reagierte das Carben nicht mit Alkanen wie Cyclohexan und Pentan, was auf seine Stabilität hinweist. Zu Vergleichszwecken wurde auch die Stereoselektivität des Bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octan- 8 -ylidens in intermolekularen Reaktionen untersucht. Nach DFT-Rechnungen ist dieses Carben durch Hyperkonjugation stabilisiert, aber zu einem geringeren Ausmaß als die zuvor erwähnte Stabilisierung im endo-Tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -yliden durch Wechselwirkung mit den Walshorbitalen. Bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octan- 8 -yliden reagierte stereoselektiv mit Acrylnitril und Diethylamin. In Cyclohexan war wiederum die Umlagerung des Carbens favorisiert. This {{research}} project {{set out to}} study the chemistry of endo-tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidene, which as a concluding result is classified as a foiled carbene. Although rearrangement reactions of this carbene had previously been studied, its classification as a foiled carbene could be more thoroughly assessed by examining its stereoselectivity in intermolecular reactions. The occupied Walsh orbitals of the endo-fused three-membered ring donate electrons into the empty p orbital of the carbenic center. As a consequence, the bridge containing the divalent carbon leans towards the cyclopropane ring. The substrates employed were expected to approach the carbenic center anti to the three-membered ring, where more space is available due to the bending of the bridge. An oxadiazoline carbene precursor was synthesized and the subsequent generation of the corresponding carbene was induced by thermolysis or photolysis. endo-Tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidene was trapped stereoselectively with acrylonitrile, diethylamine, benzaldehyde, and acetophenone. When reactions were carried out in cyclohexane and cyclohexene, however, isomerization reactions of the carbene were favored. The lack of reactivity with the electron-rich double bond of cyclohexene reflects the nucelophilicity of endo-tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidene. Moreover, the carbene did not react with alkanes, i. e., cyclohexane and pentane, which indicates its stabilization. For comparison, the stereoselectivity of bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octan- 8 -ylidene in intermolecular reactions was also studied. DFT calculations suggest that this carbene is stabilized by hyperconjugation, but to a lower extent than the aforementioned stabilization in endo-tricyclo[3. 2. 1. 02, 4]octan- 8 -ylidene through Walsh orbital interaction. Bicyclo[3. 2. 1]octan- 8 -ylidene reacted stereoselectively with acrylonitrile and diethylamine. Again, in cyclohexane, rearrangement of the carbene was favored. DFT calculations at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* level of theory were performed in order to investigate the stabilization energy of some structurally related carbenes. The calculations indicated that an exo-fused three-membered ring provides little stabilizing effect on the divalent carbon {{in comparison to the}} corresponding endo-fused species. In contrast, the presence of a combination of double bond and endo-fused three-membered ring appears to even further stabilize foiled carbenes...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{the work}} carried out for this thesis, there were no {{publications}} in which bpy {{was used as a}} ligand backbone, or in which a carboxylate was incorporated into a MOF using a TPG. Also, {{to the best of our}} knowledge there are no examples in the literature of an ethyl carbamate TPG in MOFs. In this thesis the range of TPG protected ligands has been expanded to include 1, 4 -bdc (Chapter 2) and bpy (Chapters 4 and 5). The bpy-NHBoc and bpy-TBE materials are the first examples of N-donor type ligands protected by TPGs. Furthermore, the bpy-TBE ligand is the first example of a TPG protected carboxylate in a MOF. In Chapter 2, 1, 4 -bdc-NH 2 was protected as both the ethyl carbamate and the tert-butylcarbamate, giving 1, 4 -bdc-NHCOOEt and 1, 4 -bdc-NHBoc, which there then incorporated into a MOF- 5 -type framework. It was envisaged that thermolysis of the carbamate esters could generate an isocyanate group, though this was not expected for 1, 4 -bdc-NHBoc due to the tendency of tert-butylcarbamates to decompose to the amine. Despite thermolysis on the TGA apparatus only generating the amine, it was found that thermolysis under vacuum enabled not only enabled ~ 60 % conversion of the ethylcarbamate to 1, 4 -bdc-NCO, but also a ~ 20 % conversion of the tert-butylcarbamate to 1, 4 -bdc-NCO. The MOF- 5 analogues in this work also proved sufficiently stable to survive the thermolysis conditions with little discernible effect on the porosity of the material. In Chapter 3, 1, 3 -bdc-NH 2 was protected as both the ethyl carbamate and the tert-butylcarbamate, giving 1, 3 -bdc-NHCOOEt and 1, 3 -bdc-NHBoc, which there then incorporated into a lon-e-type framework. It became apparent the lon-e was a poor choice in MOF for use with TPGs as the framework was prone to collapse from desolvation, and it was not possible to <b>thermolyse</b> the materials without complete collapse of the MOFs. In Chapter 4, bpy-NH 2 and bpy-CO 2 H were protected with TPGs to give bpy-NHBoc and bpy-TBE respectively. The ligands were combined with bpdc and zinc to obtain the BMOF- 1 -bpdc analogues MUF 20 -Aβ and MUF 20 -Aγ. Whilst the thermolysed materials MUF 20 -Aβt and MUF 20 -Aγt demonstrated significant gas uptakes compared to their protected counterparts, comparison of MUF 20 -Aβt with the directly synthesised material MUF 20 -Aβ’ revealed significantly higher uptakes than the thermolysed materials. This discrepancy indicates that the BMOF- 1 -bpdc/MUF 20 framework is partially degraded under thermolysis conditions. These results strongly imply that this framework is not compatible with TPGs. However, TPGs did allow for the installation of a carboxylate group into the BMOF- 1 -bpdc/MUF 20 framework which was not obtainable through direct synthesis methods. In Chapter 5, bpy-TBE was combined with btb and Zn/Cu to obtain Zn-DUT- 23 -TBE and Cu-DUT- 23 -TBE. These materials were then thermolysed to produce Zn/Cu-DUT- 23 -CO 2 H, materials that were not able to be directly synthesised using bpy-CO 2 H. Unfortunately, the thermolysed materials demonstrated significant decreases in uptakes compared to their protected counterparts. However, the TPG containing materials also had markedly lower uptakes than the parent Zn-DUT- 23 and Cu-DUT- 23 materials, which has been attributed to pore collapse. This partial pore collapse may have sufficiently weakened the MOF framework to increase its sensitivity to the thermolysis conditions, resulting in a much larger decrease in uptake than would have been the case with a defect free material. The results of this thesis revealed that MOF stability is a key factor in the compatibility of a material. Specifically, the MOF must be resistant to solvent removal and subsequent heating at elevated temperatures for extended periods. This is most clearly observed in Chapter 3, where the lon-e materials were very susceptible to solvent removal, and later were completely collapsed by thermolysis. These findings have led to the recommendations outlined in section 6. 2 for the screening of MOFs for their compatibility with TPGs...|$|E

All the oxime ethers gave the products expected from homolytic scission of both the O-C bond (viz., R 1 R 2 C=NOH and PhCH 3) and N-O bond (viz., R 1 R 2 C=NH and PhCH 2 OH). The yields of these products depended on which solvent was used and the rates of decomposition of the O-benzyl oxime ethers were greater in 9, 10 -dihydrophenanthrene and 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene than in tetralin. These results indicated that a reverse radical disproportionation reaction in which a hydrogen atom was transferred from the solvent to the oxime ether, followed by 3 ̆b 2 -scission of the resultant aminoalkyl radical, must be important in the latter two solvents. Benzaldehyde {{was found to be}} an additional product from <b>thermolyses</b> conducted in tetralin. This, and other evidence, indicated that another induced decomposition mode involving abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom, followed by 3 ̆b 2 -scission of the resulting benzyl radical, became important for some substrates.

The nucleophilic addition of acetic acid on terminal alkynes proceeds smoothly and regioselective towards the Markovnikov addition.

We report the block copolymer-assisted generation of locally regular chains of quasi-spherical gold nanoparticles with narrow particle diameter distribution by mild thermolysis of the non-polar gold precursor gold mesitylene inside the cylindrical nanopores of self-ordered anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). The block copolymer separates the gold mesitylene {{as well as}} the developing gold nanoparticles from the AAO pore walls so that surface nucleation and pinning of gold clusters are prevented. Growing quasi-spherical gold nanoparticles locally deform the polymer chains irreversibly adsorbed on the AAO pore walls, and the polymer chains are pushed into the space between the gold nanoparticles.
