5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange <b>tethers,</b> and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{enters the}} space station via an airlock. She cannot re-establish {{communication}} with Kowalski and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the capsule away from the ISS, the tangled parachute <b>tethers</b> prevent it from separating from the station. Stone performs a spacewalk in order to release the cables, succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. Stone aligns the Soyuz with Tiangong, but discovers that Soyuz's engine has no fuel.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother filament {{and there is a}} major loss of nucleation efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother filament. p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 <b>tethers</b> Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E

5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium <b>tethers</b> the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which <b>tethers</b> the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to maneuver through the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the <b>tethers</b> between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E
40|$|Designing {{of a small}} {{satellite}} {{based on}} the Satellite Design Contest is progressing in Kyushu University. This is a <b>tethered</b> satellite using double <b>tether.</b> This satellite’s goal is {{to build up the}} technology of a <b>tethered</b> satellite in a very small system for the future uses such as in scientific investigations. A couple of <b>tethered</b> satellites have been launched by now, but these were rather complex and expensive. On the other hand, the satellite we are planning is a very small satellite which total mass weighs about 50 kg, and planned to be launched as a piggy-back satellite of the other satellite. Generally, a <b>tethered</b> satellite can use gravity gradient stabilizing system, and many applications are considered. At the same time, <b>tether</b> is made of so fine fiber deployed over hundreds of kilometers, that a <b>tethered</b> satellite has a weak point that <b>tether</b> could be cut easily by space debris. Therefore, by using double <b>tether,</b> even if one part of one side of the <b>tether</b> was cut, {{the other side of the}} <b>tether</b> remains. For this reason, the survivability of this system can be increased drastically. The dynamics of the <b>tether</b> is complex and is difficult to predict its behavior. Generally in deploying the <b>tether,</b> the satellite which is closer to the earth tends to move forward and another satellite backward. Further more in reeling up, <b>tether</b> swing libration increases as the <b>tether</b> length gets shorter because of the conservation of angular momentum. Many <b>tether</b> control laws have been studied to control thes...|$|R
40|$|A <b>tethered</b> {{aerostat}} {{model is}} developed using a computationally efficient recursive <b>tether</b> model. The recursive rigid-body <b>tether</b> model results in unconstrained ordinary differential equations and maintains {{much of the}} simplicity of simple lumped-mass <b>tether</b> models, while avoiding numerical difficulties associated with using many stiff elastic elements with low mass. Further efficiency is achieved by treating each <b>tether</b> link as a body of revolution and assuming that <b>tether</b> spin is negligible to the dynamics. The <b>tether</b> {{is attached to a}} six-degree-of-freedom aerostat model using a single viscoelastic element. The final recursive <b>tethered</b> aerostat model is well suited for a variety of trade studies required for design and analysis of such systems, due to its low computational cost and numerical robustness. Simulations are used to show how the proposed recursive model can be used to investigate the dynamic response and <b>tether</b> loads for a 17 m <b>tethered</b> aerostat in response to varying winds...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes utilising the {{distributed}} Lorentz {{forces that}} are induced in an electromagnetic <b>tether</b> as a control actuator for controlling the <b>tether</b> motion. The control input governing {{the magnitude of the}} applied actuator force is the current being conducted within the <b>tether.</b> A wave-absorping controller is also proposed to suppress the unstable high order modes that tend to be initiated by electromagnetic forces. The absorption of travelling waves along the <b>tether</b> may be achieved by proper movement of the <b>tether</b> attachment point on the main satellite. A mission function control law is presented for controlling the <b>tether</b> length and in- and out-of-plane librations, derived from a model that treats the <b>tether</b> as an inextensible rigid rod. The control law is numerically simulated in a continuum model of the <b>tether</b> system. It is shown that the out-of-plane motion of the <b>tether</b> can be effectively damped by appropriate control of the <b>tether</b> current for inclined orbits. The effect of <b>tether</b> flexibility does not significantly alter the time history of the <b>tether</b> librations, but causes significant bowing that grows into instability of the lateral modes. It is shown that this instability can be effectively suppressed by applying the proposed waveabsorbing controller...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Most small robots {{require a}} <b>tethered</b> {{connection}} with a power and control source. The <b>tether</b> has advantages, namely robust communication and safe recovery, and disadvantages, tangling with obstacles and rough terrain. Active <b>tether</b> is a new research area for <b>tethered</b> robot systems. It provides continuously distributed form of actuation for robots that results from the effect of water hammer. It also reduces the friction of the <b>tether</b> by the jerks from the water hammer effect.

40|$|The <b>tethered</b> {{satellite}} control mechanisms consist of four major subsystems. The reel drive mechanism stores the <b>tether.</b> It is motor driven {{and includes a}} level wind to uniformly feed the <b>tether</b> to the reel. The lower boom mechanism serves two primary functions: (1) it measures <b>tether</b> length and velocity as the <b>tether</b> runs through the mechanism, and (2) it reads the <b>tether</b> tension at the reel. It also provides change the direction for the <b>tether</b> from the reel to the upper boom mechanism. The deployment boom positions the upper boom mechanism with satellite out of the cargo bay. The deployment function places the 500 -kg satellite 20 m away from the Space Shuttle (producing a small natural gravity gradient force), impacts an initial velocity to the satellite for deployment, and allows for satellite docking {{at a safe distance}} from the body of the Space Shuttle. The upper boom mechanism (UBM) services three functions: (1) it provides <b>tether</b> control to the satellite as the satellite swings in and out of plane; (2) it reads <b>tether</b> tension in the low range during the early deployment and final retrieval parts of the mission; and (3) it produces additional <b>tether</b> tension at the reel when <b>tether</b> tension to the satellite is in the low range...|$|R

25|$|There {{were two}} methods of {{piloting}} balloons: free flight or captive. Free flight {{meant that the}} balloon was able to travel in any direction or distance for as long or {{as far as the}} pilot was able to fly it. Captive flight meant that the balloon was retained by a tether or series of <b>tethers</b> manned by ground crews. Free flight required that the pilot ascend and return by his own control. Captive flight used ground crews to assist in altitude control and speedy return to the exact starting point. <b>Tethers</b> also allowed for the stringing of telegraph wires back to the ground. Information gathered from balloon observation was relayed to the ground by various means of signaling. From high altitudes the telegraph was almost always necessary. At closer altitudes a series of prepared flag signals, hand signals, or even a megaphone could be used to communicate with the ground. At night either the telegraph or lamps could be used. In the later battles of Lowe's tenure, all reports and communications were ordered to be made orally by ascending and descending with the balloon. This is notable in Lowe's Official Report II to the Secretary where his usual transcriptions of messages were lacking. Free flight would almost always require the aeronaut to return and make a report. This would be an obvious detriment to timely reporting.|$|E
25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides {{the face of the}} kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or <b>tethers</b> to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
