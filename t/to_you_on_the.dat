500|$|The opening {{movement}} is a chorale fantasia, [...] "" [...] (Out of deep anguish I call <b>to</b> <b>You),</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hymn tune in Phrygian mode. It combines {{the structure of}} a motet with chromatic and dissonant harmonies. As in his motets and the chorale cantata Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2, Bach uses the old style of scoring, with all instruments doubling the vocal parts. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that Bach's use of older musical style may reflect Bach pointing back at the source, Luther's paraphrase of a text from the Old Testament. The lower voices begin each line with imitation on the melody to come, which is then presented in long notes by the soprano as a cantus firmus. The musicologist Julian Mincham interprets the imitative counterpoint as a [...] "portrayal of the individual cries of distress which coalesce to form a combined human clamour". John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares the style to both Heinrich Schütz and Anton Bruckner, observing that although using the means of older masters, Bach [...] "push the frontiers of this motet movement almost out of stylistic reach through abrupt chromatic twists to this tune in Phrygian mode." ...|$|E
