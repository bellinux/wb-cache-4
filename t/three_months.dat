5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} <b>three</b> <b>months</b> {{in those with}} proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and <b>three</b> <b>months</b> is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate. Unprovoked DVT patients {{should have at least}} <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of anticoagulation and be considered for extended treatment. Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than <b>three</b> <b>months</b> unless there is a high risk of bleeding. In that case, <b>three</b> <b>months</b> is sufficient. Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested for <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E

40|$|To {{delineate}} endocrine mechanisms regulating equine luteal {{function and}} the possible functional differences between one <b>month</b> and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> corpora lutea of pregnancy (CL), the in vitro basal releases of prostaglandin F (PGF), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), progesterone, and 17 beta-estradiol by one and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL of pregnant mares were evaluated. In addition, the in vitro effects of PGF 2 alpha PGE 2, progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol on synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) and sex steroids were studied. PGF, PGE 2, and 17 beta-estradiol secretion was higher in one <b>month</b> than in <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, while progesterone was secreted similarly by both types of CL. PGE 2 treatment decreased 17 beta-estradiol in one month CL; progesterone increased PGE 2 in one and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL; 17 beta-estradiol increased PGE 2 in one month CL. This study suggests that, in one month CL, PGE 2 production could be regulated by progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol, while, in <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, this prostaglandin seems {{to be under the}} control of progesterone alone...|$|R

40|$|Forward {{exchange}} rate bias explanation generally falls {{into two categories}} – assumption of rational expectation resulting in a risk premium and expectation errors which is systematic. The paper tests the bias in the Indian forward exchange markets using one-month and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> forward contracts. The study finds that the <b>three</b> <b>month</b> contracts have larger prediction errors than the one-month contracts. The also paper finds that the prediction errors have information content which leads to assume the presence of risk premium. The study also finds that risk one-month contracts have lesser variability vis-à-vis the <b>three</b> <b>month</b> contracts. ...|$|R
