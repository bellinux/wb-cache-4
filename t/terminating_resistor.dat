The DA consists of a pair of transmission lines with characteristic impedances of Z0 independently connecting the inputs and outputs of several active devices. An RF signal is thus supplied to the section of transmission line connected to the input of the first device. As the input signal propagates down the input line, the individual devices respond to the forward traveling input step by inducing an amplified complementary forward traveling wave on the output line. This assumes the delays of the input and output lines are made equal through selection of propagation constants and lengths of the two lines and as such the output signals from each individual device sum in phase. <b>Terminating</b> <b>resistors</b> Zg and Zd are placed to minimize destructive reflections.|$|R

With digital data rates reaching beyond 1 -Gbit/s, digital designers are now wrestling with a new list of design problems such as transmission line reflections and signal distortion due to poorly chosen transmission line terminators. By properly choosing a termination matching the characteristic impedance (Z 0) of the transmission line, the energy in a digital transmission line signal can be absorbed and turned into heat instead of being reflected and interfering with other forward propagating signals. Care must be taken, however, when choosing a resistor for high speed transmission line termination—not just any resistor from the top desk drawer will do. A <b>terminating</b> <b>resistor</b> that matches at low frequencies may not remain a match at high frequencies. Lead and bond wire inductance, parasitic capacitance and skin effect can drastically change the impedance of a terminator at high frequencies. This change in impedance, and the resulting signal distortion, can cause false triggering, stair stepping, ringing, overshoot, delays and loss of noise margin in high speed digital circuits [3]. The rise time of the digital signals required to transmit data at multi-gigabit rates is now under 100 ps. The equivalent sine wave frequency of a digital signal (fknee, the knee frequency) can be approximated by dividing 0. 5 by the rise time [1]. The knee frequency is the frequency above which harmonics present in the pulse edge may be ignored. The faster the rise time, the higher the knee frequency and the more important high quality terminators become. Digital drivers and SERDES (serializer/deserializer) chips with sub- 100 ps rise times are widely available today.
