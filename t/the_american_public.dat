5|$|MacArthur was {{enormously}} popular with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> Streets, public works, {{and children were}} named after him. Even a dance step was named after him. In 1955, his promotion to General of the Armies was proposed in Congress, but the proposal was shelved.|$|E
5|$|After {{the riot}} in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> {{concerns}} about {{nuclear weapons and}} related technology continued {{to be present in}} the 1970s.

50|$|The speech {{also made}} {{an impact on}} Norwegian-Americans {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> opinion on <b>the</b> {{struggle}} in Europe. The impression of the Norwegian's situation had been severely damaged by an article by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> reporter, Leland Stowe, who happened to be in Oslo on the day the Germans marched into the city. He witnessed shocked Norwegian civilians standing around watching the Germans march down the parade street Karl Johans gate. He misinterpreted the shock as indifference and acceptance {{on the part of the}} Norwegian population and wrote a stinging article in Time and several newspapers which severely damaged <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> opinion of <b>the</b> Norwegian resistance and therefore their motivation to help Norway and Europe. The speech corrected that impression.|$|R
5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> as a people {{increasingly}} succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Heavy Metal and American Pop, Warner Bros. became excited about the second version of Hey Good Lookin, forming a {{specialty}} division for the film's distribution. The film opened in New York City on October 1, 1982, and was released in Los Angeles in January 1983. Although it went largely unnoticed by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> it received respectable business in foreign markets.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism was {{supported}} by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Public</b> Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what they saw as subversion.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance {{brought the}} Hare Krishna {{movement}} to the wider attention of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted {{the interest of the}} mainstream media. Most notably, he was interviewed on ABC's The Les Crane Show and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a KPFK radio station program hosted by Peter Bergman. Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station KFRC.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression {{presented}} a unique time for film-making in the United States. The economic disaster {{brought on by}} the stock market crash of 1929 changed American values and beliefs in various ways. Themes of American exceptionalism and traditional concepts of personal achievement, self-reliance, and the overcoming of odds lost great currency. Due to the constant empty economic reassurances from politicians {{in the early years of}} the Depression, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> developed an increasingly jaded attitude.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} began targeting {{food crops}} in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> {{was not made}} aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public,</b> was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
