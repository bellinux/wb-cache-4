It had a wooden and iron conveyor leading from the pond to a point a door about 15 feet above the ground. In the early 1900s the ice on the pond was often 18 inches <b>thick.</b> <b>Harvesting</b> crews used large saws to cut ice into 3-4-foot swaths. Teams of horses shod with ice shoes were used to extract and haul the ice to the conveyor. The icehouse had about 2-3 feet inner walls filled with insulating sawdust. The icehouse rotted and fell down in the 1950s and little if anything remains of it today.|$|R

The pseudo-first order rate constant evaluated {{was found to}} be a function of temperature and particle size. The activation energy evaluated, however, is independent of the particle size. A proposed mechanism involving nucleation f ~-MnO 2 at EMD surface via equilibration with Mn(II) in the electro-lyte followed by the growth of ~-MnO 2 into the core of EMD particles is discussed. Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD), a very important cathode material in dry cells, is usually manufactured by anodic oxidation of manganous sulfate at inert anode sub-strates such as titanium or graphite in hot dilute sulfuric acid (1). The EMD is formed as a deposit on the anode dur-ing electrolysis. The deposit is allowed to grow to about one to two inches <b>thick</b> before <b>harvest.</b> In other words, dif-ferent portions of the EMD deposit are retained in the elec-trolyte for different periods of time, which vary from day...|$|R

50|$|Cedar logs {{comprise}} the primary support {{system of the}} plank houses of the Pacific Northwest Indians, and are clad with <b>thick</b> cedar planks <b>harvested</b> from living trees. Cedar trees have a straight grain with very few knots and have good weather resistance. The straight grain enables the separation of planks of wood from the tree. Craftspeople would insert a wedge to separate a section of wood through {{the height of the}} tree and removed it with an adze at both ends. This harvest method was sustainable and enabled the people to use the wood and to have a supply of planks to rebuild in another location. The patience of the people is evident in the practice of leaving the wedge in place to continue the pressure that would enable another wedge placement further up, creating longer planks.|$|R

Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C).

In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|R

40|$|Ultrathin planar {{absorbing}} layers, including semiconductor {{and metal}} films, and 2 D materials, are promising {{building blocks for}} solar energy harvesting devices but poor light absorption has been a critical issue. Although interference in ultrathin absorbing layers has been studied to realize near perfect absorption at a specific wavelength, achieving high broadband absorption still remains challenging. Here, we both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated a method to tune not only reflection phase shift but also electromagnetic energy dissipation to design broadband solar absorber with simple planar structure consisting of an ultrathin absorbing layer separated from the metallic substrate by a transparent layer. We explicitly identified by deriving a new formulism that the absorbing material with refractive index proportional to the wavelength as well as extinction coefficient independent of the wavelength, is the ideal building block to create ultrathin planar broadband absorbers. To demonstrate the general strategy for naturally available absorbing materials in both high-loss (refractory metals) and weak-absorption (2 D materials) regimes, we leveraged the bound-electron interband transition with a broad Lorentz oscillator peak to design a solar thermal absorber based on a ultrathin Cr layer; and leveraged the strong exciton attributed to the spin-orbit coupling for the spectrum near the band edge, and the bound-electron interband transition for shorter wavelengths, to design a solar photovoltaic absorber based on a atomically thin MoS 2 layer. Furthermore, our designed ultrathin broadband solar absorbers with planar structures have comparable absorption properties compared to the absorbers with nanopatterns.

However, hepatocytes {{have a limited}} proliferation potential in vitro, and it generally takes a several days to form a sheet morphology and multi-layered sheets. We herein report our rapid and efficient technique for generating multi-layered human hepatic cell (HepaRG® cell) sheets using pre-cultured fibroblast monolayers derived from human skin (TIG- 118 cells) as a feeder layer on a temperature-responsive culture dish. Multi-layered TIG- 118 /HepaRG cell sheets with a <b>thick</b> morphology were <b>harvested</b> on day 4 of culturing HepaRG cells by forceful contraction of the TIG- 118 cells, and the resulting sheet could be easily handled. In addition, the human albumin and alpha 1 -antitrypsin synthesis activities of TIG- 118 /HepaRG cells were approximately 1. 2 and 1. 3 times {{higher than those of}} HepaRG cells, respectively. Therefore, this technique {{is considered to be a}} promising modality for rapidly fabricating multi-layered human hepatocyte sheets from cells with limited proliferation potential, and the engineered cell sheet could be used for cell transplantation with highly specific functions...|$|R
40|$|Tissue-engineered {{vascular}} grafts {{must have}} qualities that rival native vasculature, specifically {{the ability to}} remodel, the expression of functional endothelial components and a dynamic and functional extracellular matrix (ECM) that resists {{the forces of the}} arterial circulation. We have developed a device that when inserted into the peritoneal cavity, attracts cells around a tubular scaffold to generate autologous arterial grafts. The device is capable of cyclically stretching (by means of a pulsatile pump) developing tissue to increase the mechanical strength of the graft. Pulsed (n = 8) and unpulsed (n = 8) devices were implanted for 10 days in Lovenaar sheep (n = 8). Pulsation occurred for a period of 5 - 8 days before <b>harvest.</b> <b>Thick</b> unadhered autologous tissue with cells residing in a collagen ECM was produced in all devices. Collagen organization was greater in the circumferential direction of pulsed tissue. Immunohistochemical labelling revealed the hematopoietic origin of > 90 % cells and a significantly higher coexpression with vimentin in pulsed tissue. F-actin expression, mechanical failure strength and strain were also significantly increased by pulsation. Moreover, tissue could be grafted as carotid artery patches. This paper shows that unadhered tissue tubes with increased mechanical strength and differentiation in response to pulsation can be produced with every implant after a period of 10 days. However, these tissue tubes require a more fine-tuned exposure to pulsation to be suitable for use as vascular grafts. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research was arranged experimentally using Randomized Block Design (RBD) consists of 13 tomato genotypes from crosses with 3 replications were placed haphazardly. Seedlings were transplanted to a plot with a size of 1 m x 5 m with a spacing of 50 cm x 50 centimeter. Each plot treatment plant sample taken as many as 10 plants of 20 tomato plants for plant height, stalk diameter, weight per fruit, fruit length, thick fruit pulp, fruit diameter, total fruit number per plant and total fruit weight per plant. Analysis of variation was later translated into genetic parameters with Griffing method IV models. The outcomes indicated that the genotype of Champions can be chosen as one of the hybrid parents because it delivers a sound value to improve the character of days to flowering, stem diameter, <b>harvesting,</b> <b>thick</b> fruit pulp, fruit diameter, weight per fruit, and total fruit weight per plant. Genotype T 78 x 1, T 13 x 1, T 3 x 13 and T 1 x 13 has a value corresponding to improve the role of stem diameter, days to flowering, and weight per fruit.

40|$|The {{quality of}} tissue {{engineered}} vascular grafts should rival native vasculature. This study evaluates {{the effect on}} the mechanical properties of stretching developing graft material inside the peritoneal cavity. At the University of Queensland, a device has been developed that, when inserted into the peritoneal cavity, attracts cells around a tubular scaffold to generate autologous arterial grafts. The device is capable of cyclically stretching (by means of a pulsatile pump) developing tissue to increase the mechanical strength of the graft. Pulsed (n= 8) and unpulsed (n= 8) devices were implanted for 10 days in lovenaar sheep (n= 8). Pulsation occurred for a period of 5 - 8 days before <b>harvest.</b> <b>Thick</b> unadhered autologous tissue with cells residing in a collagen extracellular matrix was produced in all devices. From each implant, as well as from normal carotid arteries, an axially and a circumferentially oriented strip of approximately 10 by 5 mm was cut. These samples were then mounted on a uniaxial tensile test bench (INSTRON 5567) and submitted to cyclic loading at gradually increasing levels of elongation (crosshead speed of 1 mm/s), followed by elongation until rupture. The acquired data was processed to obtain the Cauchy stress and the logarithmic strain. All samples were tested within 48 hours after explantation. Different variables were extracted from each experimental data set: the stress level at 20, 30, 40 and 50 % strain, the tangent stiffness at these strain levels and the stress and strain at which failure occurred. These variables showed a significant (p= 0. 049) increase of failure strength, as well as a significant (p= 0. 028) increase of failure strain for pulsed samples compared to controls. No significant differences were found for stress or tangent stiffness at the different strain levels. Testing direction (axial versus circumferential) had no significant effect on the mechanical properties, neither for the pulsed nor the unpulsed samples. Summarized data of the failure stress and failure strain are shown in Table 1 for pulsed and unpulsed samples, and for carotid artery samples. This study has shown that unadhered tissue tubes with increased mechanical strength in response to pulsation can be produced with every implant after a period of 10 days. However, these tissue tubes require a more fine-tuned exposure to pulsation to be suitable for use as vascular grafts.
