5|$|<b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro {{has led to}} {{extensive}} {{discussion about}} its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro to do so.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{project of}} castle-building was also initiated, {{under the direction}} of Master James of Saint George, a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in Savoy on his return from the crusade. These included the castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech, intended to act both as fortresses and royal palaces for the King. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. Also a product of the Crusades was <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentric castle, and four of the eight castles Edward founded in Wales followed this design. The castles made a clear, imperial statement about Edward's intentions to rule North Wales permanently, and drew on imagery associated with the Byzantine Roman Empire and King Arthur in an attempt to build legitimacy for his new regime.|$|E
