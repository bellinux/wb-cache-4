60|$|Archie {{was not a}} {{man with}} a wide visiting-list among people with families, and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action at the table that he had {{forgotten}} what sixteen is capable of doing with a knife and fork, when it really squares its elbows, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> gets going. The spectacle which he witnessed was consequently at first a little unnerving. The long boy's idea of trifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out for more. He ate like a starving Eskimo. Archie, in the time he had spent in the trenches making the world safe for the working-man to strike in, had occasionally been quite peckish, but he sat dazed before this majestic hunger. This was real eating.|$|E
50|$|The {{curator of}} the Virtual Natural Museum, Asha, {{receives}} an anonymous package that contains a small soil sample. She tests the soil and finds no radiation and {{a high level of}} moisture. Although she tests the sample with technological instruments, she also uses her own senses. When she <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> inhales the smell of the soil, she is plunged into a vision, into a deep pool of water. Based on both the mechanical, scientific tests, and her own, biological, visions, Asha believes that life may have returned to the environment outside the community.|$|E
50|$|Going into utter meltdown, {{she walks}} out of her London office, gets on a train, and {{ends up in the}} middle of nowhere. Asking for {{directions}} at a big, beautiful house, she’s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea they’ve hired a lawyer - and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She can’t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the ironing board to open. How she <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> begins to cope - and finds love - is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake.|$|E

5000|$|Two voices appear {{over the}} scene, one is of The Patient (age 25 at this point) {{and the other}} is a sadistic man known only as [...] "The Doctor" [...] (played by Maximillian Magick).

50|$|Tom's head {{is stuck}} in the board, but he is safe. Jerry then {{proceeds}} to twist the board like a helicopter propeller and Tom lifts off. The cat stops the board's rotation and unravels his neck, and then frees himself from the board. Tom sighs in relief until he sees that he is falling toward the sea. He grabs the board again and uses it to actually fly like a glider. He dives after an unsuspecting Jerry, and when Jerry spots him, Tom chases him into a vent pipe. However, Tom is squeezed {{through the hole in}} his board and bounces around through the pipe. Tom crawls through successively shorter widths of pipe in order to reach the mouse, and when the chase exits the plumbing, Tom is compressed into a cylinder with legs barely a centimeter wide, forming himself in some kind of a walking stick. When the cat realizes this, he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> uncompresses himself, briefly looking like a more monstrous feline in the process.|$|E
5000|$|The TARDIS materialises and the Headhunter {{announces that}} they’ve {{arrived on the}} planet Orbis, the {{province}} of a species known as Keltans. Lucie struggles to accept that somewhere out there is the Doctor and she begins to worry about how scruffy she looks. She <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> opens the door - {{only to find the}} ship is hovering in mid-air, several metres above a huge ocean. The Headhunter explains that the nearest land is about 50 miles away - then she pushes Lucie through the door and into the great expanse of water. As Lucie thrashes about in panic, the Headhunter says that because of the increased saline content, she should float easily, and the current will take her in the direction she needs. Unfortunately they’re {{in the middle of a}} rather hefty storm front, but she’s sure Lucie will be fine providing she keeps her mouth shut. The Headhunter closes the door and returns alone to the control room. She then proceeds to make a phone call and sends her contact a sequence of co-ordinates, telling the recipient they will be diving at dawn… ...|$|E

50|$|Cain and Alicia {{have another}} encounter, and {{he tries to}} {{convince}} her to promise him her first-born child in exchange for Roland’s life. She tells {{him to go to}} Hell, and he say, “my dear girl, that’s exactly where I’ve come from,” (200.)The ship is sinking, and Roland is still searching for Alicia when he encounters Cain, who keeps callinghim Jacob. Roland still has not made the connection, since he cannot remember his life before his parents died, but he plays along, asking Cain {{what he has to do}} to save Alicia’s life. Cain says, “I hope you’ll carry out the part of the agreement your father was unable to fulfill… Nothing more. And nothing less” (203.)Tears in his eyes, Roland agrees. Cain tells Roland where Alicia is, and explains that it’s already underwater and she won’t be able to breathe by the time he reaches her. He finds the room, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> searches her out in the darkness. He waits for the ship to touch the bottom of the sea so that the pressure will not pull them back down; when the impact came, the ceiling above began collapsing on top of them, and Roland’s leg was pinned beneath the woody debris. Alicia was struggling to hold her breath, so Roland pulled her to him, and though she tried to resist, he breathed the last of his air into her mouth and then pushed her away towards the surface.Max helps Alicia out of the water; Victor wakes up on the beach and helps the two of them ashore, asking, “Where’s my Roland?” (207.)Roland never returned.|$|E
5000|$|Lisa Weidenfeld of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, writing that [...] "Tatiana Maslany’s acting justifiably gets endless kudos for this show, but it’s always worth giving {{credit to the}} makeup and costume {{department}} as well. As Beth, she looked haunted, exhausted, and ill, with tangled hair and a wardrobe that suggested a Type A personality that’s collapsed in on itself. Sarah may have had similar enough hair to slip into Beth’s identity, but {{in only a few}} scenes, the show quickly established how little that should have fooled anyone. Den of Geek critic Marc Buxton praised [...] "the absolute brilliance of Tatiana Maslany" [...] and the [...] "ballsy move" [...] of crafting the season premiere as a flashback episode. He went further to say, [...] "somehow, this episode is the most gripping and intense installment of Orphan Black that I’ve watched in years. You may think you’ll be disappointed that your favorites are nowhere to be seen, but relax, five minutes of watching Maslany playing Beth in the cop’s final days, you will be riveted." [...] Caroline Framke for Vox praised the episodes return to the simplicity of the first season. She criticized the convoluted nature of the third seasons storytelling. She wrote, [...] "its so promising that the fourth season premiere <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> a significant step back from Orphan Blacks preexisting, overlapping stories. In a risky move, [...] "The Collapse of Nature" [...] holds off on forging ahead from where the show left off to travel back in time, {{all the way back to}} the beginning. Its the smartest move Orphan Black has made in ages". She summarized her thoughts as a whole saying that the show [...] "lost some viewers last season as it kept burrowing ever deeper into its own mythology. When the show is off its game, its a confused jumble of sci-fi nonsense and good intentions. But when Orphan Black is good, its a laser-focused, hyper-imaginative gem. If this fourth season can sweep aside some of the clutter and find its surreal, fiercely intelligent core again, theres no reason to believe it will be anything other than great." ...|$|E
40|$|Imagine a theater. Build {{one in your}} mind. I do {{not care}} {{if it is the}} largest theater in the {{universe}} or if it {{is the size of a}} shoebox. The theater can be an elaborate construction with gilded cherubs and priceless jewels. If you would prefer the theater to be a minimal design, imagine it that way. Maybe the theater is made out of glass or crystal. You can be all alone in the theater or maybe you are seated next to an alien, a cave man, or a robot. As the curtain rises an enormous pipe organ is spewing out J. S. Bach 2 ̆ 7 s Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The sound is colossal. The stage is designed to look like a filthy and bleak art studio. Sculptures that look like decaying flesh hang from the ceiling. Papers and dirty painting rags are scattered all over the floor. A roach crawls towards some moldy food in the wastebasket. A piece of beef jerky sits next to a pile of paint tubes and paintbrushes. Canvases are stacked against the wall. Dried paint is splattered everywhere. A woman enters stage left. As she begins to speak, the music fades. 2 ̆ 2 My most recent paintings are meant to serve as gateways between daily life and an exotic utopian fantasy. These strange psychological spaces function as portals into a new frontier inhabited with the most stupendous creatures. Active volcanoes, carnivorous plants, terrible lizards, pink Chihuahuas, flesh-eating insects, unidentified flying objects, and a host of other amazing things coexist in this cruel tropical paradise. 2 ̆ 2 Everything I do is a self-portrait and a disguise. I imagine the characters in my paintings to be mutant clones. The act of painting is like looking in the mirror. I like to spend most of my time doing one or the other. I am driven by an insatiable urge to see what I truly look like. I suffer from an unfulfilled desire to meet myself. I am frustrated with impressions and reflections. These confessions reveal my work as possibly the most disgusting display of narcissism in the entire history of art. 2 ̆ 2 The act of painting is an absurd and self-indulgent enterprise. I paint with the ridiculous and frivolous purpose of delighting the eye. Nevertheless, my hope is that my paintings capture an important aspect of my utopian fantasy with their sumptuous surroundings embellished with rainbows, natural disasters, butterflies, exotic grasses and bizarre costumes. 2 ̆ 2 My paintings can be read on many different levels from surface to deep allegory. The finished product is the result of hours upon hours of painting, pondering, and dreaming. Below the surface lies a nauseating abyss. 2 ̆ 2 My work is a delicious feast for the aesthetic consumer. I am a villainous mad scientist with a hunger for immortality. My eyes are gluttonous fools. I am a mystery and a deception. Vermillion is my opulent fetish. Lemon yellow is my nemesis. 2 ̆ 2 The music grows louder again. The woman begins to cackle. She then <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> a deeper and more dramatic bow. She exits stage right [...] you find that you want to applaud [...] but unfortunately, this story is not over. I suggest that you get yourself a snack like some popcorn, chocolate, or gummy bears before reading any further. The curtain slowly and elegantly comes down...|$|E
