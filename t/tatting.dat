40|$|AbstractCellular {{internalization}} of cell-penetrating peptide HIV- 1 <b>Tat</b> basic domain (RKKRRQRRR) was {{studied in}} Triticale cv AC Alta mesophyll protoplasts. Fluorescently labeled monomer (<b>Tat)</b> and dimer (<b>Tat</b> 2) of <b>Tat</b> basic domain efficiently translocated through the plasma membrane of mesophyll protoplast and showed distinct nuclear accumulation within 10  min of incubation. Substitution of first arginine residue with alanine in <b>Tat</b> basic domain (M-Tat) severely reduced cellular uptake of the peptide (3. 8 times less than <b>Tat).</b> <b>Tat</b> 2 showed greater cellular internalization than <b>Tat</b> (1. 6 times higher). However, characteristics of cellular uptake remained same for <b>Tat</b> and <b>Tat</b> 2. Cellular internalization of <b>Tat</b> and <b>Tat</b> 2 was concentration dependent and non-saturable whereas {{no significant change}} in cellular uptake was observed even at higher concentrations of M-Tat. Low temperature (4  °C) remarkably increased cellular internalization of <b>Tat</b> as well as <b>Tat</b> 2 but M-Tat showed no enhanced uptake. Viability test showed that peptide treatment had no cytotoxic effect on protoplasts further indicating involvement of a common mechanism of peptide uptake at all the temperatures. Endocytic inhibitors nocodazole (10  μM), chloroquine (100  μM) and sodium azide (5  mM) did not show any significant inhibitory effect on cellular internalization of either <b>Tat</b> or <b>Tat</b> 2. These results along with stimulated cellular uptake at low temperature indicate that <b>Tat</b> peptide is internalized in the plant protoplasts in a non-endocytic and energy-independent manner. Competition experiments showed that non-labeled peptide did not inhibit or alter nuclear accumulation of fluorescent <b>Tat</b> or <b>Tat</b> 2 suggesting active transport to the nucleus was not involved.

40|$|AbstractcDNAs {{encoding}} the bovine {{immunodeficiency virus}} (BIV) transactivator gene (<b>tat)</b> were cloned from virally infected cells and characterized. BIV expresses two distincttatmRNAs composed of three exons that are derived by alternative splicing. The BIV <b>tat</b> mRNA splice variants encode <b>Tat</b> proteins of 103 (<b>Tat</b> 103) and 108 (<b>Tat</b> 108) amino acids. The <b>Tat</b> 103 coding region is specified only by exon 2, while that of <b>Tat</b> 108 is specified by a truncated exon 2 {{and the first}} 30 nt of exon 3. Thus, the first 98 amino acids of each <b>Tat</b> are identical, and have amino terminal, cysteine-rich, conserved core, basic, and carboxyl-terminal domains similar to <b>Tats</b> encoded by primate lentiviruses. BIV-infected bovine cells express a 14 -kDa phosphorylated <b>Tat</b> protein identical in size to recombinant <b>Tat</b> expressed in bacteria. BIV <b>Tat</b> was shown to localize exclusively in the nucleoli of virally infected and Tat-expressing cells. Reporter gene assays indicated that <b>Tat</b> 103 and <b>Tat</b> 108 can strongly transactivate the BIV long terminal repeat (LTR) in virally permissive canine Cf 2 Th and nonpermissive HeLa and mouse NIH 3 T 3 cells, but not in permissive lapine EREp cells. However, an intact BIVtatgene is required for viral replication in both Cf 2 Th and EREp cells. Strong LTR activation by BIV <b>Tat</b> requires a TAR (transactivation responsive) element delimited by viral nt + 1 to + 31 and the <b>Tat</b> basic domain. BIV <b>Tat</b> strongly cross-transactivates the HIV- 1 LTR in a TAR-dependent manner in Cf 2 Th, but not in EREp, HeLa, or NIH 3 T 3 cells. In contrast, strong, TAR-dependent cross-transactivation of the BIV LTR by HIV- 1 <b>Tat</b> could not be demonstrated {{in any of these}} cell types. In Cf 2 Th cells <b>Tat</b> 108 effects a moderately stronger transactivation of the BIV LTR than <b>Tat</b> 103, indicative of a functional difference in BIV <b>Tat</b> proteins encoded by the mRNA splice variants. The present studies demonstrate that BIV <b>Tat</b> parallels the primate lentiviral <b>Tats</b> in structure and biochemistry but is not interchangeable with the latter...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHIV- 1 encodes for {{the small}} basic protein <b>Tat</b> (86 - 101 residues) that {{drastically}} enhances the efficiency of viral transcription. The mechanism enabling <b>Tat</b> nuclear import is not yet clear, but studies using reporter proteins fused to the <b>Tat</b> basic domain indicate that <b>Tat</b> could reach the nucleus by passive diffusion. <b>Tat</b> also uses an unusual transcellular transport pathway. The first step of this pathway involves high-affinity binding of <b>Tat</b> to phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P(2)), a phospholipid that is concentrated in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and enables <b>Tat</b> recruitment at this level. <b>Tat</b> then crosses the plasma membrane to reach the outside medium. Although unconventional, <b>Tat</b> secretion by infected cells is highly active, and export is the major destination for HIV- 1 <b>Tat.</b> Secreted <b>Tat</b> can bind {{to a variety of}} cell types using several different receptors. Most of them will allow <b>Tat</b> endocytosis. Upon internalization, low endosomal pH triggers a conformational change in <b>Tat</b> that results in membrane insertion. Later steps of <b>Tat</b> translocation to the target-cell cytosol are assisted by Hsp 90, a general cytosolic chaperone. Cytosolic <b>Tat</b> can trigger various cell responses. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular <b>Tat</b> acts as a viral toxin that affects the biological activity of different cell types and has a key role in acquired immune-deficiency syndrome development. This review focuses on some of the recently identified molecular details underlying the unusual transcellular transport pathway used by <b>Tat,</b> such as the role of the single Trp in <b>Tat</b> for its membrane insertion and translocation...|$|R

By utilizing synthetic peptides representing the amino acid sequence of <b>Tat,</b> one major B cell epitope was defined within the cysteine-rich domain of <b>Tat.</b> Anti-Tat IgG Abs directed against this epitope were found in mice immunized with all <b>tat</b> DNA constructs, whereas different <b>Tat</b> epitopes were detected in mice immunized with the <b>Tat</b> protein.

40|$|The {{trans-activator}} <b>Tat</b> proteins coded {{by human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and HIV- 2 appear to be similar in structure and function. However, the <b>Tat</b> protein of HIV- 2 (<b>Tat</b> 2) activates the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) less efficiently than <b>Tat</b> 1 (M. Emerman, M. Guyader, L. Montagnier, D.

Our results indicate that <b>Tat</b> 1 proteins containing substitutions of either 8 or 14 amino acids of the basic domain of <b>Tat</b> 2 exhibited reduced trans activation of the HIV- 1 LTR by about 1 / 20 or one-fourth the level induced by wt <b>Tat</b> 1.

Mutation of an acidic residue (Glu) located between the core domain and the Arg-rich basic domain of <b>Tat</b> 2 at position 77 to a Gly residue increased the activity of <b>Tat</b> 2 substantially.

40|$|Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a bovine {{lentivirus}} genetically {{similar to}} bovine immunodeficiency virus; it causes an acute and sometimes fatal disease in infected animals. This virus carries a very potent <b>Tat</b> that can strongly activate not only its own {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) but also the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) LTR. In contrast, HIV <b>Tat</b> cannot reciprocally activate the JDV LTR (H. Chen, G. E. Wilcox, G. Kertayadnya, and C. Wood, J. Virol. 73 : 658 – 666, 1999). This indicates that in transactivation JDV <b>Tat</b> may utilize a mechanism similar to but {{not the same as}} that of the HIV <b>Tat.</b> To further study the similarity of JDV and HIV <b>tat</b> in transactivation, we first tested the responses of a series of HIV LTR mutants to the JDV <b>Tat.</b> Cross-transactivation of HIV LTR by JDV <b>Tat</b> was impaired by mutations that disrupted the HIV type 1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA stem-loop structure. Our results demonstrated that JDV <b>Tat,</b> like HIV <b>Tat,</b> transactivated the HIV LTR at least partially in a TAR-dependent manner. However, the sequence in the loop region of TAR was not as critical for the function of JDV <b>Tat</b> as it was for HIV <b>Tat.</b> The competitive inhibition of Tat-induced transactivation by the truncated JDV or HIV <b>Tat,</b> which consisted only of the activation domain, suggested that similar cellular factors were involved in both JDV and HIV Tatinduced transactivation. Based on the one-round transfection assay with HIV <b>tat</b> mutant proviruses, the cotransfected JDV <b>tat</b> plasmid can functionally complement the HIV <b>tat</b> defect. To further characterize the effect of JDV <b>Tat</b> on HIV, a stable chimeric HIV carrying the JDV <b>tat</b> gene was generated. This chimeric HIV replicated in a T-cell line, C 8166, and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which suggested that JDV <b>Tat</b> can functionally substitute for HIV <b>Tat.</b> Further characterization of this chimeric virus will help to elucidate how JDV <b>Tat</b> functions and to explain the differences between HIV and JDV <b>Tat</b> transactivation...|$|R

Similarly, other shorter synthetic peptides covering the different <b>Tat</b> domains were inactive. Interestingly, when peptides <b>Tat</b> 1 - 48 and <b>Tat</b> 38 - 60 were used simultaneously, a significant transactivation was obtained.

While most people thought it a pity that a {{sensible}} woman like Mary had not found a good husband--and even her female friends said nothing more ill-natured of her, than that her face was {{like a piece of}} putty with two Scotch pebbles stuck in it--Rebecca was always spoken of sarcastically, and it was a customary kind of banter with young ladies to recommend her as a wife to any gentleman they happened to be flirting with--her fat, her finery, and her thick ankles sufficing to give piquancy to the joke, notwithstanding the absence of novelty. Miss Rebecca, however, possessed the accomplishment of music, and her singing of 'Oh no, we never mention her', and 'The Soldier's Tear', was so desirable an accession to the pleasures of a tea-party that no one cared to offend her, especially as Rebecca had a high spirit of her own, and in spite of her expansively rounded contour, had a particularly sharp tongue. Her reading had been more extensive than her sister's, embracing most of the fiction in Mr. Procter's circulating library, and nothing but an acquaintance with the course of her studies could afford a clue to the rapid transitions in her dress, which were suggested by the style of beauty, whether sentimental, sprightly, or severe, possessed by the heroine of the three volumes actually in perusal. A piece of lace, which drooped round the edge of her white bonnet one week, had been rejected by the next; and her cheeks, which, on Whitsunday, loomed through a Turnerian haze of network, were, on Trinity Sunday, seen reposing in distinct red outline on her shelving bust, like the sun on a fog-bank. The black velvet, meeting with a crystal clasp, which one evening encircled her head, had on another descended to her neck, and on a third to her waist, suggesting to an active imagination either a magical contraction of the ornament, or a fearful ratio of expansion in Miss Rebecca's person. With this constant application of art to dress, she could have had little time for fancy-work, even if she had not been destitute of her sister's taste for that delightful and truly feminine occupation. And here, at least, you perceive the justice of the Milby opinion as to the relative suitability of the two Miss Linnets for matrimony. When a man is happy enough to win the affections of a sweet girl, who can soothe his cares with crochet, and respond to all his most cherished ideas with beaded urn-rugs and chair-covers in German wool, he has, at least, a guarantee of domestic comfort, whatever trials may await him out of doors. What a resource it is under fatigue and irritation to have your drawing-room well supplied with small mats, which would always be ready if you ever wanted to set anything on them! And what styptic for a bleeding heart can equal copious squares of crochet, which are useful for slipping down the moment you touch them? How our fathers managed without crochet is the wonder; but I believe some small and feeble substitute existed in their time under the name of 'tatting'.

Thus there was a good deal of family unlikeness between Rebecca and her sister, and I am afraid there was also a little family dislike; but Mary's disapproval had usually been kept imprisoned behind her thin lips, for Rebecca was not only of a headstrong disposition, but was her mother's pet; the old lady being herself stout, and preferring a more showy style of cap than she could prevail on her daughter Mary to make up for her.|$|E

Earlier {{we showed that}} CDK 2 /cyclin E phosphorylates HIV- 1 <b>Tat</b> in vitro. We also showed that CDK 2 induces HIV- 1 transcription in vitro and that inhibition of CDK 2 expression by RNA interference inhibits HIV- 1 transcription and viral replication in cultured cells. In the present study, we analyzed whether <b>Tat</b> is phosphorylated in cultured cells by CDK 2 and whether <b>Tat</b> phosphorylation has a regulatory effect on HIV- 1 transcription. Results We analyzed HIV- 1 <b>Tat</b> phosphorylation by CDK 2 in vitro and identified Ser 16 and Ser 46 residues of <b>Tat</b> as potential phosphorylation sites. <b>Tat</b> was phosphorylated in HeLa cells infected with Tat-expressing adenovirus and metabolically labeled with 32 P. CDK 2 -specific siRNA reduced the amount and the activity of cellular CDK 2 and significantly decreased phosphorylation of <b>Tat.</b> <b>Tat</b> co-migrated with CDK 2 on glycerol gradient and co-immunoprecipitated with CDK 2 from the cellular extracts. <b>Tat</b> was phosphorylated on serine residues in vivo, and mutations of Ser 16 and Ser 46 residues of <b>Tat</b> reduced <b>Tat</b> phosphorylation in vivo. Mutation of Ser 16 and Ser 46 residues of <b>Tat</b> reduced HIV- 1 transcription in transiently transfected cells. The mutations of <b>Tat</b> also inhibited HIV- 1 viral replication and <b>Tat</b> phosphorylation {{in the context of}} the integrated HIV- 1 provirus. Analysis of physiological importance of the S 16 QP(K/R) 19 and S 46 YGR 49 sequences of <b>Tat</b> showed that Ser 16 and Ser 46 and R 49 residues are highly conserved whereas mutation of the (K/R) 19 residue correlated with non-progression of HIV- 1 disease. Conclusion Our results indicate for the first time that <b>Tat</b> is phosphorylated in vivo; <b>Tat</b> phosphorylation is likely to be mediated by CDK 2; and phosphorylation of <b>Tat</b> is important for HIV- 1 transcription. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>Tat</b> protein is a transcriptional activator that is essential for efficient viral gene expression and replication. <b>Tat</b> increases the level of full-length transcripts from the HIV- 1 promoter by dramatically enhancing the elongation efficiency of the RNA polymerase II complexes assembled on this promoter. <b>Tat</b> could potentially activate the transcription machinery during initiation, elongation, or both. We used an immobilized HIV- 1 promoter template with a reversiblelacrepressor (LacR) elongation block inserted downstream to dissect the stages in transcription affected by <b>Tat.</b> Transcription complexes assembled {{in the absence of}} <b>Tat</b> and blocked by LacR cannot be activated by incubation with <b>Tat</b> alone. These complexes can, however, be activated if <b>Tat</b> is added in combination with cellular factors. In this system, <b>Tat</b> also promoted the assembly of preinitiation complexes capable of elongating efficiently, suggesting that <b>Tat</b> can associate with transcription complex at an early stage. These data indicate that <b>Tat</b> can activate elongation of RNA polymerase by modifying an already elongating transcription complex. The data also suggest the possibility that <b>Tat</b> can interact with initiation complexes...|$|R
50|$|Traditional shuttle <b>tatting</b> may be {{simulated}} using a <b>tatting</b> needle or doll needle {{instead of}} a shuttle. There are two basic techniques for needle <b>tatting.</b> With the more widely disseminated technique, a double thread passes through the stitches. The result is similar to shuttle <b>tatting</b> but is slightly thicker and looser. The second technique more closely approximates shuttle <b>tatting</b> because a single thread passes through the stitches.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, <b>tatting</b> needles became commercially {{available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes, from fingering yarn down to size 80 <b>tatting</b> thread. Few patterns are written specifically for needle tatting; some shuttle <b>tatting</b> patterns may be used without modification. There are currently two manufacturers of <b>tatting</b> needles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tat</b> {{also uses}} an unusual transcellular {{transport}} pathway. Firstly, it binds with high affinity to phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), {{found on the}} inner surface of the cell membrane, this enables <b>Tat</b> recruitment at this level. <b>Tat</b> then crosses the plasma membrane to reach the extracellular space. <b>Tat</b> secretion by infected cells is highly active, and export is the major destination for HIV-1 <b>Tat.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the interferon-induced, double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated kinase, PKR, is able to bind to and phosphorylate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) trans-activating protein, <b>Tat.</b> Furthermore, <b>Tat</b> can inhibit the activation and activity of the kinase. Phosphorylation of <b>Tat</b> by PKR {{is dependent on the}} prior activation of PKR by dsRNA and occurs on serine and threonine residues adjacent to the basic region important for TAR RNA binding and <b>Tat</b> function. Activated PKR efficiently phosphorylates both the two-exon form of <b>Tat</b> (Tat- 86) and the single exon form (Tat- 72). Mutagenesis indicates that the interaction between PKR and <b>Tat</b> requires the RNA-binding region of <b>Tat.</b> <b>Tat</b> competes with eukaryotic initiation factor 2, a well-characterized substrate of PKR, for phosphorylation by activated PKR. <b>Tat</b> also inhibits the autophosphorylation of PKR by dsRNA. This biochemical evidence of an intimate relationship between <b>Tat,</b> an important regulator of HIV transcription, and PKR, a pleiotropic cellular regulator, may provide insights into HIV- 1 pathogenesis and, more generally, virus/host interactions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Retroviral {{transduction}} {{of cells}} is improved upon virus adsorption onto immobilized fibronectin (FN) fragments. Because HIV- 1 <b>Tat</b> possesses the same functional domains {{that lead to}} increased transduction efficiency in FN by colocalization of bound virus and cells, we hypothesized that <b>Tat</b> could enhance gene transfer by a similar mechanism. METHODS: Single-cycle replication retro- or lentivirus carrying green fluorescent protein or cloramphenicol acetyltransferase as reporter genes were added to wells coated with <b>Tat</b> or <b>Tat</b> peptides. Wells were extensively washed to remove unbound virus and levels of transduction were detected by measuring reporter gene expression. Virus adsorption to immobilized <b>Tat</b> was measured using a p 24 antigen capture assay. RESULTS: Immobilized <b>Tat</b> efficiently binds retro- and lentiviral particles and mediates virus transmission at virus input doses that were otherwise unable to transduce susceptible cells. Virus adsorption to <b>Tat</b> is not mediated by envelope glycoprotein (Env) because immobilized <b>Tat</b> binds and retains vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudotypes as well as envelope-free particles. HIV- 1 Env or VSV-G are required for Tat-assisted transduction, which is abrogated by an antibody blocking the HIV- 1 Env-CD 4 interaction. Tat-assisted transduction is mediated by the cysteine-rich region of <b>Tat,</b> which {{is known to be}} essential for <b>Tat</b> transactivation activity. However, <b>Tat</b> transactivation is not required for Tat-assisted transduction, as indicated by the enhancement of transduction by transactivation-silent <b>Tat</b> mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Immobilized <b>Tat</b> promotes virus transduction by a transactiva- tion-independent mechanism, which requires binding of virus to <b>Tat.</b> Recombinant <b>Tat</b> or <b>Tat</b> fragments provide a new method to increase efficiency of retro- and lentiviral based gene transfer and gene therapy...|$|R
