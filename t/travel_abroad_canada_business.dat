50|$|Aschoff was {{interested}} in the pathology and pathophysiology of the heart. He discovered nodules in the myocardium present during rheumatic fever, the so-called Aschoff bodies. Aschoff's reputation attracted students from all over the world, among them Sunao Tawara. Together they discovered and described the atrioventricular node (AV node, Aschoff-Tawara node). Numerous <b>travels</b> <b>abroad,</b> to England, <b>Canada,</b> Japan, and the U.S. led to many research connections, whereas the trips to Japan proved to be especially productive. Aschoff's popularity in Japanese medicine had its roots in his work with Tawara and a journey through Japan in 1924. In the early 20th century, 23 of 26 Japanese pathological institutes were headed by students of Aschoff.|$|R
5000|$|Robyn Van En {{was one of}} the originators of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), a {{business}} model that helps small, diverse organic farms cope with the expenses of organic farming methods by selling [...] "shares" [...] of the harvest to CSA members before the farming seasons begins. This prevents the farmer from needing to borrow money to cover costs {{at the beginning of the}} season, and promotes community support for the farmer, as CSA members share in the risk of farming by paying up front and receiving farm produce throughout the season. Van En started the first CSA in the United States on her Indian Line Farm in Massachusetts. Later, she helped create more than 200 other CSA farms as she travelled across the United States, proselytizing fresh, local, organic produce. She also <b>travelled</b> <b>abroad</b> to Russia, <b>Canada,</b> South America, Africa, New Zealand, Russia, and Hungary, leading to more than 1,200 active CSAs.|$|R

40|$|Background: Provisional {{plans of}} the European Union aim for {{increasing}} the right for patients to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for healthcare. Desired and expected impact of this future ruling is to achieve enhanced patient mobility and to realize effective cooperation and better sharing capacities between different European countries. However, {{the number of patients}} that goes abroad to consume healthcare is relatively small. In this study, it is examined whether people are actually willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for healthcare and under what conditions. These conditions will provide insights in whether and how patient mobility can be influenced. Methods: Data were obtained from an insurants’ panel that consists of over 10 500 insurants from one particular Dutch health insurer. Several questions were posed to 1500 panel members to examine if people were willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for health services in three different circumstances: (i) in case, they can be treated by a highly reputable specialist abroad; (ii) to avoid national waiting lists; and (iii) in case, healthcare is provided cheaper abroad. Results: Preliminary results from the insurants’ panel show that a majority is willing to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> for treatment provided by a highly reputable specialist (65 %) and when it can reduce waiting times in the home country (60 %). If treatment is provided for a lower price across the border, 36 % reported {{that they are willing to}} <b>travel</b> <b>abroad.</b> Conclusions: People do not reject the idea of <b>travelling</b> <b>abroad</b> for healthcare. Most of the respondents reported that they are willing to go abroad in case they can be treated sooner and by specialized healthcare providers. It seems that a majority of people cannot be encouraged to <b>travel</b> <b>abroad</b> when healthcare is lower priced. An important conclusion with policy implications is that people attach strong value to effective and high-graded healthcare and less to the financial aspects. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
