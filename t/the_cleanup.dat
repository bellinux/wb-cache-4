5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|Along with U.S. Senator John Kerry, Keating {{helped to}} {{finalize}} <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> {{and sale of}} portions of a defunct naval air base in South Weymouth to private developers. The deal, reached in November 2011, was a linchpin for the SouthField development project.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Ocean <b>Cleanup</b> and its CEO/founder Boyan Slat {{have won}} {{numerous}} distinctions. The United Nations Environment Programme awarded Slat with the Champion of the Earth in 2014, {{and he was}} previously {{recognized as one of}} the 20 Most Promising Young Entrepreneurs Worldwide by Intel EYE50. In 2015, Harald V of Norway awarded Slat the maritime industry's Young Entrepreneur Award and <b>The</b> Ocean <b>Cleanup</b> Array was named as a London Design Museum Design of the Year. Also in 2015, <b>the</b> Ocean <b>Cleanup</b> Array won <b>the</b> INDEX: Award in 2015 and the 2015 Fast Company Innovation By Design Award in the category Social Good.

5|$|Following the McClelland Royal Commission, a large {{clean-up}} {{was completed}} in outback South Australia in 2000, after nuclear testing at Maralinga during the 1950s contaminated the region. <b>The</b> <b>cleanup</b> lasted three years, and cost over A$100million, but there was controversy over the methods used and success of the operation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Red Cross workers were activated in response to the cyclone. A force of 400 German prisoner of wars and 200 Bahamian laborers participated in <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> process.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few traces of the previous night's celebration remain after <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> process is completed: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.|$|E

5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E
5|$|Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's {{production}} {{values and}} aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton {{said that he}} has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; {{it was a way to}} answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> by itself.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Hanford site {{represented}} {{two-thirds of}} the nation's high-level radioactive waste by volume. Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and {{is the focus of}} the nation's largest environmental cleanup.

5|$|The book {{describes}} the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic {{efforts by the}} ship's crew to contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the fires were contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin cleaning up the turret. <b>The</b> <b>cleanup</b> involved removing {{the bodies of the}} deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> efforts.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{had been}} Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Project, {{and was in}} charge of {{radiation}} safety at the first nuclear test, Trinity, in New Mexico, {{as well as of the}} on-ground inspections at Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings. At Operation Crossroads, it was his job to keep the sailors safe during <b>the</b> <b>cleanup,</b> and to avoid giving them grounds to sue the Navy if health problems developed later.|$|E
50|$|After the fire, as {{a fundraiser}} {{to help finance}} <b>the</b> site <b>cleanup,</b> <b>the</b> Historic Salisbury Foundation started selling bricks from the mill. The only other roller mill still extant in Rowan County is the China Grove Roller Mill.|$|R
50|$|In November 2012, Hurricane Sandy {{forced the}} waters of Sheepshead Bay to overflow, {{resulting}} in tons of spoiled food at the Cherry Hill market. During <b>the</b> post-hurricane <b>cleanup</b> <b>the</b> food was discarded, but the Lundy's Building otherwise survived.|$|R

5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage. In Majahual, the only town to experience {{the full force of}} the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> and recovery efforts. Roads connecting {{the north and south}} of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E
50|$|Critics in Honolulu {{argue that}} such {{ordinances}} are a waste of taxpayer money in a futile effort to clear city streets. Each sweep costs state taxpayers around $15,000. In the weeks after <b>the</b> <b>cleanups,</b> homeless encampments can be found blocks away from <b>the</b> previous <b>cleanups.</b> Most of Hawaii's homeless are stuck on the island with no close relatives. With the sit lie ban in place, homeless are forced from city park to city park {{in order to avoid}} fines or confiscation of items. Most city parks in Honolulu are being forced to close down earlier in order to prevent the homeless from using them.|$|R

5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
5|$|Plains All American Pipeline {{estimated}} that <b>the</b> <b>cleanup</b> had cost $96 million during a joint oversight {{hearing of the}} State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26, 2015. Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements. The CEO stated in the report that all but $65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shutdown.|$|E
