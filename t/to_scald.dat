500|$|After the duel {{between the}} two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy {{officials}} who witnessed the battle that Monitors design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of [...] "liquid fire", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as <b>to</b> <b>scald</b> the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her." [...] The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} modern methods for making clotted cream. The [...] "float cream method" [...] includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. <b>To</b> <b>scald,</b> the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for {{up to an hour}} it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The [...] "scald cream method" [...] is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.|$|E

60|$|He {{was glad}} {{when he found}} that dinner was at hand, {{and that he could}} not now see his sister until after he had {{fortified}} himself with drink. Anty rarely, if ever, dined with him; so he sat down, and swallowed his solitary meal. He did not eat much, but he gulped down three or four glasses of wine; and, immediately on having done so, he desired the servant, with a curse, to bring him hot water and sugar, and not to keep him waiting all night for a tumbler of punch, as he did usually. Before the man had got into the kitchen, he rang the bell again; and when the servant returned breathless, with the steaming jug, he threatened to turn {{him out of the house}} at once, if he was not quicker in obeying the orders given him. He then made a tumbler of punch, filling the glass half full of spirits, and drinking it so hot as <b>to</b> <b>scald</b> his throat; and when that was done he again rang the bell, and desired the servant to tell Miss Anty that he wanted to speak to her. When the door was shut, he mixed more drink, to support his courage during the interview, and made up his mind that nothing should daunt him from preventing the marriage, in one way or another. When Anty opened the door, he was again standing with his back to the fire, his hands in his pockets, the flaps of his coat hanging over his arms, his shoulders against the mantel-piece, and his foot on the chair on which he had been sitting. His face was red, and his eyes were somewhat blood-shot; he had always a surly look, though, from his black hair, and large bushy whiskers, many people would have called him good looking; but now there was a scowl in his restless eyes, which frightened Anty when she saw it; and the thick drops of perspiration on his forehead did not add benignity to his face.|$|E
6000|$|By long {{observation}} I have understood, That {{two little}} vermin are kin to Will Wood. The first is an insect {{they call a}} wood-louse, That folds up itself in itself for a house, As round as a ball, without head, without tail, Enclosed cap à pie, in a strong coat of mail. And thus William Wood to my fancy appears In fillets of brass roll'd up to his ears; And over these fillets he wisely has thrown, To keep out of danger, a doublet of stone.[1] The louse of the wood for a medicine is used Or swallow'd alive, or skilfully bruised. And, let but our mother Hibernia contrive To swallow Will Wood, either bruised or alive, She need be no more with the jaundice possest, Or sick of obstructions, and pains in her chest. [...] The next is an insect we call a wood-worm, That lies in old wood like a hare in her form; With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch, And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch; Because like a watch it always cries click; Then woe be {{to those in the}} house who are sick: For, as sure as a gun, they will give up the ghost, If the maggot cries click when it scratches the post; But a kettle of scalding hot-water injected Infallibly cures the timber affected; The omen is broken, the danger is over; The maggot will die, and the sick will recover. Such a worm was Will Wood, when he scratch'd at the door Of a governing statesman or favourite whore; The death of our nation he seem'd to foretell, And the sound of his brass we took for our knell. But now, since the Drapier has heartily maul'd him, I think the best {{thing we can do is}} <b>to</b> <b>scald</b> him; For which operation there's nothing more proper Than the liquor he deals in, his own melted copper; Unless, like the Dutch, you rather would boil This coiner of raps[2] in a caldron of oil. Then choose which you please, and let each bring a fagot, For our fear's at an end with the death of the maggot.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the Small GTPase Rho and endothelial cytoskeleton in the increased vascular permeability of rat skin after scalding. Methods: Rats were subjected <b>to</b> <b>scalding</b> local ventral skin and a venule was isolated from scalded skin and cannulated by micropipette. The venular permeability was measured with a fluorescence ratio technique and expressed with the permeability coefficient to albumin (Pa). The venular F-actin filaments were observed by staining with rhodamine phalloidin and laser confocal scanning microscopy. A specific Rho kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 was added into vessel bathing solution or preincubated with vessels to evaluate the role of Rho kinase in regulating of vascular barrier function. Results: Scalding increased Pa value of skin venule about threefold compared to normal skin venules (P < 0. 01) and was maintained for 120 min. Inhibition of Rho kinase with Y- 27632 (30 mol/l in low-concentration group; 60 mol/l in high-concentration group) significantly attenuated the hyperpermeability responses <b>to</b> <b>scalding</b> in a dose dependent fashion. A prominent peripheral actin rim (PAR) existed at the outer area of endothelial cells and apparently delineated the cell-to-cell borders. In the control group, the PARs were arranged smoothly and fairly continuously. However, occasionally PARs did show focal interruption with focal fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -albumin leakage. In the burned group, PARs were less organized and accompanied by a large amount of FITC-albumin leakage. Inhibition of Rho kinase with Y- 27632 dramatically reduced Pa value with recovery of actin filament arrangement in venule after scalding. Conclusion: Burn leads to dermal venular permeability increase with endothelial cytoskeleton depolymerization and disruption. Rho signal transduction pathway is involved in these responses...|$|R

40|$|In two turkey {{processing}} {{plants in the}} northwest of Germany, skin samples were taken at 4 different positions (prior <b>to</b> <b>scalding,</b> after plucking, before and during chilling), which {{was repeated three times}} per sampling day (two days). The scalding technique was different (steam respectively water scalding). Samples were examined for total aerobic plate count as a hygiene parameter and the zoonotic agents Salmonella and Campylobacter. The examinations followed § 35 LMBG, DIN 10113 - 1 and DIN-ISO DIS 10272. After identification, Salmonella and a selection of Campylobacter isolates were characterized using molecularbiological pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It was the aim of this study to reflect the influence of steam scalding on the microbiological status of the turkey skin compared <b>to</b> water <b>scalding</b> and the distribution of zoonotic agents under different scalding techniques. Scalding is generally recognised a a weak point in poultry processing. Scalding by steam {{is considered to be a}} potential alternative <b>to</b> water <b>scalding.</b> In abattoir one (water scalding), an average total aerobic plate count was obtained lg 4 and 5. No significant reduction of the total aerobic plate count during scalding and plucking was observed. In the end, the microbial count at the chilling position was lower than in the beginning. In abattoir two (steam scalding), the total aerobic plate count was between lg 3, 63 and lg 7, 13. The microbial count was lower after plucking than prior <b>to</b> <b>scalding.</b> A reduction of the total aerobic plate count was sometimes significant. However, during the following procedures the microbial count increased. So in the end, steam scalding had no impact on the microbial count underlining the importance of the complete processing line. In abattoir one (water scalding), 58 % of the samples were Salmonella positive. 6 Salmonella serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Indiana, S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, S. of Group B and S. Saintpaul) were recovered. No Salmonella was identified at the first position of sampling. 42 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive (C. jejuni und C. coli). In abattoir two (steam scalding), 22 % of the samples were Salmonella positive which were recovered at each of the 4 sampling sites. Salmonella serovars were S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg und S. Saintpaul. Altogether 89 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive at each sampling site: C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari were identified. The results of PFGE demonstrate, that both, Salmonella and Campylobacter strains are being transferred through the whole processing line demonstrating the lack of critical points with respect to both zoonotic agents. With respect to restrictive legislation on zoonotic agents in the near future, the poultry processing lines must become more safe with respect to bacterial transfer...|$|R
