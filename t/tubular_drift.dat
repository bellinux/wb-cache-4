40|$|The ATLAS TRT barrel is a {{tracking}} drift chamber using 52, 544 individual <b>tubular</b> <b>drift</b> tubes. It is {{one part}} of the ATLAS Inner Detector, which consists of three sub-systems: the pixel detector spanning the radius range 4 to 20 cm, the semiconductor tracker (SCT) from 30 to 52 cm, and the transition radiation tracker (TRT) from 56 to 108 cm. The TRT barrel covers the central pseudo-rapidity region |h| < 1, while the TRT endcaps cover the forward and backward eta regions. These TRT systems provide a combination of continuous tracking with many measurements in individual drift tubes (or straws) and of electron identification based on transition radiation from fibers or foils interleaved between the straws themselves. This paper describes the recentlycompleted construction of the TRT Barrel detector, including the quality control procedures used in the fabrication of the detecto...|$|E

It {{is a part}} of the TRT tracker which {{consist of}} the barrel and two end-caps. The TRT end-caps cover the forward and backward pseudo-rapidity region 1. 0 < |h| < 2. 0, while the TRT barrel central h region |h| < 1. 0. The TRT system provides a combination of continuous tracking with many measurements in individual drift tubes (or straws) and of electron identification based on transition radiation from fibers or foils interleaved between the straws themselves. Along with other two sub-systems, namely the Pixel detector and Semi Conductor Tracker (SCT), the TRT constitutes the ATLAS Inner Detector. This paper describes the recently completed and installed TRT end-cap detectors, their design, assembly, integration and the acceptance tests applied during the construction...|$|E
