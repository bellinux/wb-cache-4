40|$|Branchwood, {{if it can}} be {{sold for}} fuel, can provide {{significant}} increases in revenues from felling broadleaved trees. A study was carried out to investigate ways of estimating crownwood volumes from easily measured tree parameters. The total (stemwood and crownwood) volumes of recently felled beech, oak and ash were measured over a diameter range of 20 to 70 cm at breast height. It was found that total volume could be predicted very accurately from diameter at breast height alone. Total height added little extra precision. The division of total volume between stem and CTOwnwood depended on the <b>timber</b> <b>height.</b> Crownwood volume could thus best be estimated by subtraction of timber volume from total volume. Total and crownwood volume tables are presented for the three species over a range of diameters and timber heights...|$|E
40|$|The general {{aim of the}} {{research}} for this thesis was to develop models to predict the performance of fire resistant light-timber framed walls, in relation to requirements of new performance-based building fire regulations being introduced around the world. The performance bases that were adopted in the modelling, were time and probability of failure. The models that were developed {{for a wide range of}} wall types, and have been specifically validated for ordinary cavity walls and double framed walls. Validation involved numerical checks for convergence and energy conservation, and the undertaking of eight full scale wall furnace experiments with well controlled conditions. Values of thermal properties of materials in the walls were obtained with simple independent experiments. These experiments helped to clarify appropriate values from the wide ranges which have been previously published. Model predictions were evaluated against results published in the literature. The models comprise specific models for fire severity, heat transfer, structural response and probability of failure. This research has developed the heat transfer model named ADIDRAS, a probability model, and undertaken all linkages of models to produce the time and probability of failure models. A model developed by a colleague, Young, was adopted for the structural response model. The time and probability of failure models can incorporate most fire severity models. In this research, two fire severity models were incorporated; one was the standard fire, and the other was the real fire severity model of Kawagoe and Lie. ADIDRAS, in several respects, is an advance on previous heat transfer models for structures containing cavities. It analyses thermal diffusion with alternating direction implicit finite difference analysis which enhances numerical stability without the loss of computation speed of explicit procedures. It uses the discrete radiation method which enables analysis of radiant heat transfer through smoke and cavities of any shape. Previous models have analysed only cavities without re-entrant corners. It was deduced that when the interfaces between studs and gypsum board on the fire side reach temperatures greater than 400 °C, the interfaces open to form gaps due to shrinkage in these materials. These gaps prevent much of the heat transferring directly from gypsum board to the studs, and divert the heat to the cavity by radiation. This diversion explains some anomalies between experimental results and predictions of previously published heat transfer models. It is shown that temperatures in studs are insensitive to the transmissivity of radiant heat in smoke. The structural model and the time of failure model have been applied, to obtain for the first time, relationships between the time of failure and a number of variables including vertical load, elastic modulus of timber, strength of <b>timber,</b> <b>height</b> of wall, size and spacing of studs, initial crookedness of studs and thickness of gypsum board. The time of failure model has established failure, induced by the vaporisation of moisture, is critical for walls that are either higher than walls commonly built (higher than 3. 6 metres), or are more heavily loaded than is currently permitted in timber structural engineering codes. It was found that the time of failure is most sensitive to fire temperature, vertical load, elastic modulus of timber in compression, and density and specific heat of timber. It is sensitive also to the thickness and thermal properties of gypsum board, and the sectional dimensions of studs; however, these variables are unlikely to vary much for walls built to specifications in common building construction. It is considered that the probability of failure model is the first theoretically-based reliability model for light-timber framed structures exposed to fire. Several applications of the model have been demonstrated. It was shown that the variabilities of thermal properties of gypsum board and wood are low compared with the large variabilities of mechanical properties inherent in timber. In the applications demonstrated, typical variations of all variables led to a coefficient of variation (Co V) in the time of failure of 0. 12 for typical walls subjected to standard (ASI 530 A) fire. Exposure to a real fire did not significantly affect this CoY. Unlike the standard fire, the real fire did not necessarily lead to collapse. There is much scope for reducing fife resistances of walls without significantly increasing the risk to life...|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} in surface checking among the samples {{in this study}} might {{be explained by the}} {{difference in}} the HWP. When all the samples were included, the HWP exhibited the highest correlations with the TLSC and NSC among the wood properties examined. In the timber that contained sapwood on the outside, the drying stress would be large between the dry sapwood at the surface and the wet heartwood on the inside. The larger dimension timber contained more sapwood and had more prominent surface checking for B 1, B 4, and R 4. For R 1, both the small- and large-dimension timbers were mostly occupied with the heartwood and exhibited similar levels of surface checking. The R 1140 timber had sapwood only at the corners (HWP was 94  %), which might not have affected the drying stress between the corners. When surface checking was compared between source <b>heights,</b> <b>timber</b> 4 contained more sapwood and exhibited more prominent surface checking than timber 1, except that R 480 was occupied with the heartwood and exhibited similar level of surface checking with R 180.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] Ability {{of visible}} {{infrared}} radiometer for stand parameter estimation was evaluated. The diameter at breast <b>height,</b> tree <b>height,</b> <b>timber</b> volume {{and so on}} were selected as the stand parameters. High correlation coefficients between those stand parameters and remote sensing data were observed in some channels. Though channels with stronger absorption by chlorophyll in the visible channels showed lower correlation, other channels like at the green peak and the red edge showed higher correlation with the stand parameters. The tendency was observed for the imagery observed in early August and early September, then those wavelength were seemed useful to estimate woody biomass Though high correlation between leaf biomass and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was reported, no clear relationship was observed between the NDVI and stand parameters. However, high correlation coefficients exceeding 0. 8 were observed between stand parameters and a normalized ratio between the 730 nm and the 2200 nm channels (ND 730 & 2200), and little observation angle effect was identified on the ND 730 & 2200. Thus the index was probably useful for biomass estimation of evergreen coniferous forests using wide view angle sensor imagery...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{management}} of timber resources and wood utilization practices require accurate and versatile information about important characteristics of forest resources {{for evaluating the}} numerous management and utilization alternatives for <b>timber</b> resources. Tree <b>height</b> {{is considered one of}} the most useful variables along with stocking and diameter at breast height, in estimating forest stand wood volumes and productivity. Six nonlinear growth functions were fitted to tree height-diameter data of three major tree species in Western Mediterranean Region’s forests of Turkey. The general-ized regression neural network (GRNN) technique has been applied for tree height prediction, as well, due to its ability to fit complex nonlinear models. The performance of the models was compared and evaluated. Further, equivalence tests of the selected models were conducted. Validation showed the appropriatness of all models to predict tree height. According to the model performance criteria, the six nonlinear growth functions were able to capture the height-diameter relation-ships and fitted the data almost equally well, while the constructed generalized regression neural network (GRNN) mod-els were found to be superior to all nonlinear regression models, in terms of their predictive ability. Key words: growth functions; generalized regression neural network models; equivalence testing.

40|$|The world tallest <b>timber</b> {{building}} with <b>height</b> of 45 meters, {{is planned for}} Bergen, Norway. In this master thesis the dynamic properties of the case building, as proposed by Sweco and Artec, are investigated. The proposed structural concept with a glulam frame and power-storeys, have never previously been built, and it is desirable to develop {{and understanding of the}} dynamic problems concerning this building. Previous work have shown problems with acceleration levels for tall timber building, mostly due to the material properties of timber. Timber has high flexibility and strength combined with low weight. The main aim of the work have been to build a 3 D-model of the case building in a finite element program, where numerical methods can be used to find the dynamic properties of the building. The wind load and acceleration levels are investigated, and found to be reasonable compared to various criterions presented. The effect of the stiffness in the connections, as well as the use of apartment modules are investigated. In addition a dynamic analysis is run, and stochastic subspace state space system identification is used to verify the model. This can later be used for verification of the actual building when finished, and will be an important method to determine the actual damping and stiffness. Based on the findings in this work, the concept is assumed feasible, possible with some changes an even better concept is achieved. It will be exciting to see how Sweco will develop the concept further in the next planning phase.
