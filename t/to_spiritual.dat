5|$|In a {{different}} reading, Shakespearean scholar Eric Sams has interpreted this reference <b>to</b> <b>spiritual</b> communion as {{an allusion to}} Barnabe Barnes, a notorious English occultist and poet, while others contend that {{the significance of the}} spirit is simply an allusion to poetic genius and that it contains no reference to an actual personage.|$|E
5|$|Since Michelangelo {{executed}} {{the nine}} Biblical scenes in reverse chronological order, some {{analyses of the}} frescoes of the vault commence with the Drunkenness of Noah.

5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) is necessary <b>to</b> <b>spiritual</b> liberation. He gave {{the principle of}} Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of modernity spirituality and {{religion}} are often used synonymously. <b>To</b> be <b>spiritual</b> was <b>to</b> be religious and to be religious was <b>to</b> be <b>spiritual.</b> Yet {{we now have a}} different understanding of spirituality, and why one can be both religious and <b>spiritual,</b> <b>to</b> be religious is not necessarily <b>to</b> be <b>spiritual</b> and <b>to</b> be <b>spiritual</b> does no...|$|R

5|$|The style {{began in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups {{recording}} on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic environments recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, Australian didgeredoos and world music sounds <b>to</b> <b>spiritual</b> chanting from other cultures.|$|E
5|$|After Ernest died in 1971, Ruth succeeded him {{as their}} group's leader and primary channeler. She {{subsequently}} began publishing accounts of her experiences and revelations. In early 1974, she predicted that a space fleet of benevolent extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would land on Earth later that year, which led the Unarius Academy {{to purchase a}} property {{to serve as the}} landing site. After the extraterrestrials failed to appear, Norman said that trauma she had suffered in a past life had caused her to make an inaccurate prediction. Undaunted, she rented a building for Unarius' meetings and sought publicity for the movement, claiming to have united the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She revised the Space Brothers' expected landing date several times, before finally settling on 2001. Her health declined in the late 1980s, prompting her students to try to heal her with rituals of past-life regression. Despite predicting that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman died in 1993. Unarius has continued to operate after her death, and formed a board of directors. Since the 2000s, leaders have concentrated on individual transformation leading <b>to</b> <b>spiritual</b> change in humankind.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a virtual}} {{listening}} {{party on the}} band's website where the full ten songs from the record were made available to listen <b>to,</b> <b>Spiritual</b> Machines was released in Canada on December 12, 2000. For those who pre-ordered the album, a limited edition version of the CD was released in a black jewel {{case in which the}} artwork was not visible, only the band's name and logo in embossed lettering.

It went on to be certified 2X Platinum in Canada. As was common practice, the album was released several months later in the United States on March 13, 2001. Upon release in the United States, it spent a total of four weeks on the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 81. In the United States, the album has yet to be certified by the RIAA. It was released to Asian and European markets on May 9, 2001 under the Epic Records label. The record was re-released in 2008 under the Sony's Special Markets division.|$|E
40|$|Spiritual {{distress}} {{has been}} associated with worse health outcomes. Assessing patient's spirituality seems especially relevant in older patients undergoing post-acute rehabilitation. However, few instruments are designed <b>to</b> assess <b>spiritual</b> distress. The objectives of this research were 1) <b>to</b> conceptualize the <b>spiritual</b> dimension and <b>to</b> develop an instrument <b>to</b> assess <b>spiritual</b> distress in hospitalized older patients; 2) <b>to</b> determine <b>spiritual</b> distress prevalence and to investigate its relationship with rehab outcomes. A qualitative approach was used <b>to</b> develop the <b>Spiritual</b> Distress Assessment Tool (SDAT). The SDAT is a semi-structured interview that assess unmet spiritual needs, and quantifies spiritual distress. In a pilot study among rehab patients (N= 69, 82. 5  8. 3 years), 61 % reported <b>spiritual</b> distress. Compared <b>to</b> the others, these patients had more functional impairment and tended to have longer stay. Further studies are needed <b>to</b> determine whether <b>spiritual</b> intervention would be effective <b>to</b> address <b>spiritual</b> distress and improve health outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Having left Thompson's tradition, Buczynski {{decided to}} form his own form of Wicca, which he claimed had {{actually}} dated {{back to the}} Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose anonymity he had to protect. Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him, despite his lack of Welsh heritage. It took as its basis {{the structure of the}} Gardnerian tradition, with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson, accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba's The Book of Shadows. Officially founded in October 1972, later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated. Notably, he welcomed LGBT people and non-caucasians into his tradition {{at a time when they}} were denied entry to most other Wiccan covens. Although taking an open attitude <b>to</b> <b>spiritual</b> seekers, Buczynski prevented the occult investigator, Hans Holzer, from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report; like many in the Pagan and occult community, Buczynski was wary of Holzer's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications.|$|E
