500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Rap-Up {{stated that}} Beyoncé is {{dominant}} over men in [...] "Run the World". [...] "Run the World" [...] {{opens with a}} short piano solo and a heavy beat. Beyoncé chants, [...] "Girls! / We run this mutha / Girls! / Who run the world." [...] It moves into smoother, more persuasive but still boastful lyrics, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> a barber/ None of these ho's can fight me/ I'm so good with this/ I remind you I'm so 'hood with this." [...] She then delivers the repetitive hook and chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings that education gives women strength and independence. Other lyrics of this theme include the line, [...] "smart enough to make these millions, strong enough to bear the children, then get back to business." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News said that Beyoncé sings in her signature staccato style on the second verse of the song. She repeats the chorus after the bridge lines and her vocals fade out as the song finishes.|$|E

IU was the only female act to perform {{on the first day}} of KCON and for the event, she performed [...] "The Red Shoes", [...] "You and I", [...] "Friday" [...] and [...] "You Know".

IU expressed her anxiety performing at the event in her interview with Billboard: [...] "I always get nervous when I'm performing at international shows... I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to study English for the next visit to the U.S. It's suffocating not being able to communicate with fans..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> it!” he said; and in {{a sudden}} fit of rage seized the glass and, moving a few steps forward, flung it {{crashing}} into the grate. Then he turned and faced the girl, flushed to the forehead, but stirred to almost unwilling respect.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's toom," [...] she said. [...] "I--I didna <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{to fill it}} this morning."

[...] "I'm richt angry at myself for being so ungrateful like." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wilson is {{afflicted with}} {{schizoaffective}} disorder that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: [...] "Mostly [...] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't." [...] He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song [...] "every now and then". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: [...] "I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody." ...|$|E

5000|$|Next Year in Zion is a 2008 studio album by Herman Düne. Lead {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} David-Ivar Herman Düne states [...] "It's the first album that I write while I am happy. <b>I</b> used to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to {{be a little}} sad, or at least melancholic to write, this one proved me wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{to break}} {{a lot of that}} {{expectancy}} down. I know from experience that I go to see some artists expecting a particular thing. If they don't come up with that then I'm disappointed, but if I have no expectations they usually do something I haven't heard before and I'm turned on. The moment you expect something, you never get it.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} do this for me," [...] he said, simply, [...] "it will be {{the service of a}} friend. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>need</b> friends now very badly." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know I'm right. And, say, don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>need</b> it, too. <b>I</b> ain't known Miss Ruth {{all this}} time for nothing. You'll be doing me a {{kindness}} if you knock my face in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> any just at present," [...] was {{the amazing}} answer. [...] "We'll talk about {{financial}} affairs {{a little later}} on." ...|$|E

5000|$|When asked - in an {{interview}} with Spanish magazine Ruta 66 - why he needed to make a solo album, Tuchscherer said: [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> to, but basically, Tom Peters asked me at the end of 2010 whether I’d like to do some recording with him. I asked the others if they had a problem, no one said they did, so in January 2011 I went into the studio with Tom." [...] He said that the album was recorded in a week or so, with the days spread out over two years.|$|R

6000|$|I {{declined}} {{firmly to}} be cured, [...] "You've been much {{too good to}} me already, old man," [...] said I; [...] "but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> trouble you further." ...|$|E
