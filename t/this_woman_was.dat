25|$|All three goddesses were ideally {{beautiful}} and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.

25|$|According {{to early}} adherents of Legio Maria, the Virgin Mary began {{appearing}} among the Luo {{people in the}} late 1920s. In their accounts, they say that she first appeared as an extraordinary itinerary woman. At a time estimated to be around 1935, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> walking at Awendo market in South Nyanza, when an empathizing tailor known as Omollo who {{was the son of}} Nyunja of Alego, Udida, gave her a dress gift. This woman is said to have promised Omollo an eternal name among the Luos. From that day on she began calling herself the mother of Omollo. By the 1940s, this woman is claimed to have visited the Catholic parish of Nyandago and conversed with over five members of its clergy about the mission of Ondetto. However, priests at Nyandago mission discounted the supposed apparitions, stating that Mary could not appear as a Black African.|$|E

25|$|The thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann {{reveals that}} Guðrøðr's mother, Affraic, was a {{daughter}} of Fergus, Lord of Galloway (died 1161). Several contemporary sources concerning Fergus' descendants suggest that {{he was married to}} an illegitimate daughter of Henry I, and that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> the mother of at least some of his offspring, including Affraic herself. Although the union between Guðrøðr's parents is not dated in contemporary sources, it appears to have been arranged in the 1130s or 1140s. The marital alliance forged between Óláfr and Fergus gave the Crovan dynasty valuable familial-connections with the English Crown, {{one of the most powerful}} monarchies in western Europe. As for Fergus, the union bound Galloway more tightly to a neighbouring kingdom from which an invasion had been launched during the overlordsship of Magnús. The alliance with Óláfr also ensured Fergus the protection of one of Britain's most formidable fleets, and further gave him a valuable ally outwith the orbit of the Scottish Crown.|$|E
25|$|Lucas could {{possibly}} {{be involved in the}} murders of two young unidentified people found in Sumter County, South Carolina in 1976. Lucas stated that he had been in South Carolina {{on the day of the}} crime.

It was initially believed that Lucas was responsible for both her murder and sexual assault. However, a bite mark on the girl's shoulder has not been confirmed to match Lucas's dental charts. Lucas confessed to the murder of a young woman found in 1981 in Corona, California that had been buried near a freeway, citing he had met her in the town of Riverside.|$|E
25|$|The goddesses quarreled bitterly over it, {{and none}} of the other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. They chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, they {{appeared}} before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris political power and control of all of Asia, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta.

500|$|Aspasia's name {{is closely}} {{connected}} with Pericles' glory and fame. Plutarch accepts {{her as a}} significant figure both politically and intellectually and expresses his admiration {{for a woman who}} [...] "managed as she pleased the foremost men of the state, and afforded the philosophers occasion to discuss her in exalted terms and at great length". The biographer says that Aspasia became so renowned that even Cyrus the Younger, who went to war with the King Artaxerxes II of Persia, gave her name to one of his concubines, who before was called Milto. After Cyrus had fallen in battle, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> carried captive to the King and acquired a great influence with him. Lucian calls Aspasia a [...] "model of wisdom", [...] "the admired of the admirable Olympian" [...] and lauds [...] "her political knowledge and insight, her shrewdness and penetration". A Syriac text, according to which Aspasia composed a speech and instructed a man to read it for her in the courts, confirms Aspasia's rhetorical fame. Aspasia is said by the Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, to have been [...] "clever with regards to words," [...] a sophist, and to have taught rhetoric.|$|E

These oxen were her sons from a jötunn (name not provided). Gefjun's plough [...] "cut so hard and deep that it uprooted the land, and the oxen drew the land out into the sea to the west and halted in a certain sound." [...] Gefjun there placed the land, and {{bestowed}} upon it the name Zealand. Where the land had been taken from a lake stands. According to Snorri, the lake is now known as Lake Mälar, located in Sweden, and the inlets in this lake parallel the headlands of Zealand; however, since this is much more true of Lake Vänern, the myth was probably originally about Vänern, not Mälaren.|$|E

However, in the unpublished transcript of Jung's comments recorded by Aniela Jaffe in 1957, Jung made it clear <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> Maria Moltzer and not Spielrein.

2500|$|Legio Maria {{developed}} gradually {{and eventually}} separated from mainstream Roman Catholicism in 1963. What is now Legio Maria started from the Catholic lay movement {{as far back}} as 1938-1940. Central to its formation are the local Luo myths about a mystery woman, min Omolo Ka-Nyunja, who walked Luo land during these years. A number of Legio Maria faithfuls believe that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the mythical stories such as Nyamgondho Kombare in Gwassi, Homa Bay County, and Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay County. According to Tobias Oloo, a Legio Maria Deacon and researcher, [...] "every religion has mythical elements and the Legio Maria movement's development relied massively on the crystallization of local myths with their beliefs." [...] Apart from the myths that probably preceded Legio Maria, Deacon Oloo affirms that the Fátima Visitation of Virgin Mary was a key ingredient to the formation of Legio Maria. [...] "As legios, we recognize the three Fatima mysteries. However, the most important for us is the third mystery which predicted the appearance of Our Lord in the 1960s. Though this mystery is controversial because the Roman Catholic did not reveal it for generations and what they eventually revealed is still contested by many Christians, we have faith that through the third mystery Mary promised the coming of Simeo Ondetto." ...|$|E
