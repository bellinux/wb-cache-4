5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Greek mainland. He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics {{in the major}} cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to bring about a war.|$|E

They were later supported by Sam Loxton (93)who hit five sixesand Ray Lindwall (77), who both struck the ball powerfully. Australia ended the day at 457/9, having added 394 runs in one day, and 102 runs {{for the last two}} wickets to that point.|$|E

Lehmann was handed a seven-match ban for racial abuse, the world's number 1 ranked ODI batsman Michael Bevan was injured, as was all rounder Shane Watson, who had {{to withdraw from the}} World Cup. At the time, another all-rounder, Andrew Symonds, had been performing poorly and had been heavily maligned by cricket analysts, but Ponting strongly advocated his inclusion. The selectors granted Ponting his wish, although the decision was considered highly controversial, especially with Waugh campaigning for his recall as an all-rounder.|$|E

25|$|As designed, the R.V {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines were mounted internally in the fuselage, and transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The fuselage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft. The Maybach engines had been a never-ending source of <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> R.II, R.III, and R.IV, and by June 1916, Siemens-Schuckert had obtained permission from the Idflieg to substitute Benz Bz.IV engines on the R.III The firm made the same change on the R.V, which was almost complete by then. The substitution required an almost complete rebuild of the aircraft, and included adding an extra bay to the wings, increasing their span. The Idflieg accepted the R.V in this form, after agreeing to a reduction in the aircraft's original specifications.|$|E

The fuselage was modified to accommodate the new powerplant, and an extra bay was added to the wings, increasing their span. Upon completion, designer Bruno Steffen piloted the R.VI on a test flight in which the aircraft carried a 2,400-kg (5,300-lb) load for six hours, a world record at the time, but one which was never publicised due to the war.|$|E

The latter powerplant was also selected for the R.VII, still under construction at the time. Apart from the new engines, the R.VII also received extensive modifications while still at the factory, including overall strengthening to take the greater weight of the heavier Mercedes engines, as well as changes to the fuel tanks, propellers, and undercarriage. The wings were completely redesigned to incorporate heavier spars and a new rib section and gained two extra bays, to provide a greater span.|$|E

She quickly showed good pace and held third place behind Lancia's Henri Toivonen and teammate Bruno Saby. However, she ran into gearbox <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tenth stage {{and was forced to}} retire.

500|$|In 1897, Peel {{had played}} {{regularly}} until July with some success. He scored 115 against Leicestershire, and took eight for 53 against Kent. He then suffered an injury in a match against Lancashire that {{caused him to}} miss around a month of cricket. He returned to the Yorkshire team to play Middlesex at Sheffield on 16 August. In Middlesex's first innings, Peel took five for 71, but on the third day, he appeared on the field drunk. Later that day, the Yorkshire committee met and resolved to suspend Peel {{for the remainder of}} the season for [...] "presenting himself on the field in a state of intoxication". According to Anthony Woodhouse, in his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, this was not Peel's first such offence. Contemporary accounts give no indication of <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field involving Peel, but the influential Lord Hawke may have encouraged the press to remain silent. The decision to suspend Peel was made public on 19 August, the following day.|$|E

500|$|On 3 September 1944, Emil Lang {{was killed}} in action when his Fw 190 A-8 (Werknummer 171 240—factory number) [...] "Green 1" [...] hit the ground and {{exploded}} in a field at Overhespen. He had experienced mechanical <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> runway when {{he and the other}} aircraft of his flight took off at Melsbroek at 1.20 pm. Ten minutes later, Lang was still having difficulties raising his landing gear. Flying at an altitude of , his wingman, Unteroffizier Hans-Joachim Borreck, called out P-47 Thunderbolts to their rear. Lang broke upward, to the left. Leutnant Alfred Groß saw Lang's Fw190 diving in flames, its gear extended, but he lost sight of Lang when his own craft was hit and he had to bail out. Examination of both German and American records suggests that Borreck and Groß misidentified their opponents. The P-51 Mustangs of the 55th Fighter Group's 338th Squadron intercepted a flight of three to six Focke Wulfs. Lieutenant Darrell Cramer took a high deflection shot at the Focke Wulf on the left, which fell upside down in a steep dive and crashed hard into the ground; this undoubtedly was Emil Lang.|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} two {{drafting}} stages, {{with the main}} issue being the alien element rather than the Viking details. Shankar was pleased that the work he did on the Viking parts of the script went unchanged from the first draft to the screen, calling it his [...] "best experience" [...] as a writer. He also chose the first name that the Doctor would attempt to use, selecting Albert Schweitzer {{from a list of}} scientists and doctors because he thought the surname sounded funny. He expected that it would be cut or changed, based on his experience in writing humorous elements into scripts for The Next Generation. He wrote several lighthearted scenes into the script and was pleased when none of them were cut, saying that he was particularly proud of the exchange between the Doctor and Freya where she says [...] "Your people must value you highly", and the Doctor responds dryly, [...] "You would think so." [...] He submitted his final version of the script on February 2, 1995. Taylor later talked about the use of the holodeck as a plot device in this episode, saying that it allowed the series to show things that otherwise couldn't happen on the show. She added that the plot in this episode [...] "transcended the idea of 'Oh, we're in <b>trouble</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> holodeck.'" ...|$|E
