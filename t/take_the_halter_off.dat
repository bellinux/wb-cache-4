6000|$|The {{next day}} he changed himself into a brown horse and told his father {{that he was to}} set off to market with him. 'If a man should come who wants to buy me,' said Jack, 'you are to tell him that you want two hundred dollars, for that he will give, and treat you besides; but {{whatsoever}} you drink, and whatsoever you do, don't forget to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> <b>off</b> me, or you will never see me more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, poor creature, what {{a master}} {{you must have}} to treat you thus!' she said, and pushed <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hook so that the horse might turn round and eat the oats.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will relieve {{you of the}} charge," [...] said Lindesay; [...] "thou wilt {{have little}} enough to do with horse, saddle, or bridle, for ten years to come--Thou mayst <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> an thou wilt--it may stand thee in a turn." ...|$|R
60|$|Clearing {{the table}} in a summary manner by {{catching}} up {{the four corners of}} the cloth, Bab put the rattling bundle into her apron, flung her children on the top and pronounced herself ready to depart. Betty lingered an instant to pick up and ends that might be spoilt by the rain, and, when she turned from taking <b>the</b> red <b>halter</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> knocker, two lovely pink roses lay on the stone steps.|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} {{the money was}} {{obtained}} and handed to the farmer, who gave Ronald a receipt for it. Ronald <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> from <b>the</b> hands of the native, and at once led the horse to the stable of the hotel at which he had already left his luggage. Then he ordered one of the cases to be opened, {{and took out a}} saddle and bridle which he had brought out with him in view of rough colonial work.|$|R
60|$|Upon this Sir Launcelot bade Sir Peris rise. And he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> of Sir Peris's horse, and he bound Sir Peris's arms {{behind his}} back, {{and when he}} had done this he drove him up to his castle at the point of his lance. And when they came to the castle he bade Sir Peris have open the castle; and Sir Peris did so; and thereupon Sir Launcelot and Sir Peris entered the castle and the damsel and the squire {{followed}} after them.|$|R
60|$|Then I saw <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> {{had come}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bear and {{had fallen to}} the ground. Hiram picked it up, {{arranged}} the noose, and, holding it in his teeth began to limb after the bear. Cubby was now {{only a few feet}} under me, working steadily up, growling, and his little eyes were like points of green fire.|$|R
60|$|By and by Gale {{remembered what}} he was waiting for; and, getting up, he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> {{and went out to}} find Blanco Sol. It was pitch-dark now, and Gale could not see a rod ahead. He felt his way, and {{presently}} as he rounded a mesquite he saw Sol's white shape outlined against the blackness. The horse jumped and wheeled, ready to run. It was doubtful if any one unknown to Sol could ever have caught him. Gale's low call reassured him, and he went on grazing. Gale <b>haltered</b> him in <b>the</b> likeliest patch of grass and returned to his camp. There he lifted his saddle into a protected spot under a low wall of the mound, and, laying one blanket on the sand, he covered himself with the other and stretched himself for the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I {{have ever seen}} a halter like that before," [...] mused Roger, as he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> bit of <b>halter</b> from Dave, and then passed it to Phil.|$|R
60|$|And thus it happened. The man got his {{two hundred}} dollars for the horse, and was treated as well, and when they parted from each other {{it was just as}} much as he could do to {{remember}} to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter.</b> But <b>the</b> buyer had not got far on his way before <b>the</b> youth <b>took</b> his own form again, and when the man reached home Jack was already sitting on the bench by the stove.|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} day all {{happened}} in the same way. The youth changed himself into a great black horse, and told his father that if a man came and offered him three hundred dollars, and treated him well and handsomely into the bargain, he was to sell him, but whatsoever he did, or how much soever he drank, he must not forget to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> or else he himself would never get away from Farmer Weatherbeard {{as long as he}} lived.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the time}} came for the fair the youth turned himself into a light-coloured horse, and bade his father go to the market with him. 'If anyone should come who wants to buy me,' said he, 'you are {{to tell him that}} you want a hundred dollars for me; but you must not forget to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> for if you do I shall never be able to get away from Farmer Weatherbeard, for he is the man who will come and bargain for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot spares Sir Phelot's life] [...] "Well," [...] said Sir Launcelot, [...] "it hath {{yet to be}} said of me that I {{have denied}} {{anything}} that I was able to grant unto any lady that hath asked it of me upon my knighthood. And yet I know not how to trust either of ye. For thou didst not say one word in my behalf when I {{was in danger of}} being slain so treacherously just now. As for this knight, I perceive that he is every whit as great a traitor and a coward as was his brother Sir Peris of the Sauvage Forest. So I will spare him, but I will not trust him, lest he turn against me ere I arm myself again. Wherefore give me hither <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> rein of your mule." [...] So the lady gave Sir Launcelot <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> rein, weeping amain as she did so. And Sir Launcelot <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> rein and he tied the arms of Sir Phelot behind him. Then he bade the lady of Sir Phelot to help him arm himself from head to foot, and she did so, trembling a very great deal. Then, when she had done so, quoth Sir Launcelot: [...] "Now I fear the treachery of no man." [...] Therewith he mounted his horse and rode away from that place And he looked not behind him at all, but rode away as though he held too much scorn of that knight and of that lady to give any more thought to them.|$|R
60|$|Every one, except Abner, <b>took</b> hold of <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> {{after some}} little delay in getting there, {{owing to the}} {{readiness}} of the pony to use his heels at the slightest provocation; and, just when {{they were about to}} put forth all their strength in pulling, the pony jumped towards them suddenly, rendering their efforts useless, and starting all, save Bob, back to the alder bushes in ignominious flight.|$|R
50|$|Some {{users have}} the animal wear a halter at all times, even when stalled or turned out. Others have the animal wear a halter only when being led, held, or tied. The {{advantages}} of leaving a halter on {{are that the}} animal is often easier to catch. The disadvantages are that an animal may catch <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> on an object and become trapped or injured in some fashion. While experts advise leaving <b>halters</b> <b>off</b> when animals are turned out, if halters are left on unattended animals, breakaway designs that still will hold for everyday leading are recommended.|$|R
60|$|The king had, in truth, {{never seen}} so large a beast, and he willingly paid the {{thousand}} dollars, which was the price demanded; but Peder remembered to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> before he left. After he was gone the king sent for the butcher {{and told him to}} kill the animal for the wedding feast. The butcher got ready his pole-axe; but just as he was going to strike, the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away, and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone. However, as the dove could not be found, he was obliged to tell the king what had happened, and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back. But Peder was safe in the woods, and could not be found. When at last he felt the danger was over, and he might go home, Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him.|$|R
5000|$|Over the nose: The shank is {{run through}} the left ring of <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> (on <b>the</b> side of the face), wrapped once around the noseband of <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> {{threaded}} through <b>the</b> right side nose ring of <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> and attached on the upper right ring of <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> (near <b>the</b> ears of the horse). In some places, this configuration is called a [...] "stallion chain," [...] though the setup is used on horses of all sexes under some circumstances. If the chain is not attached to the upper right ring, <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> can slide into the horse's eye when the shank is applied. When pressure is applied, the shank puts pressure on {{the nose of the}} horse, encouraging the animal to become more aware of the handler's signals. If the shank is used harshly, the handler can damage the horse's nose. An alternative use is to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> chain over the nose, around and under the chin, and attached back to itself.|$|R
500|$|On 31January 1606 Keyes, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour and Fawkes were <b>taken</b> to <b>the</b> Old Palace Yard in Westminster, to be hanged, {{drawn and}} quartered. [...] Rookwood and Wintour {{were the first}} to ascend to the gallows. [...] Grim-faced, Keyes went [...] "stoutly" [...] up the ladder, but with <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> around his neck he threw himself off, presumably hoping for a quick death. [...] <b>The</b> <b>halter</b> broke, however, and he was <b>taken</b> to <b>the</b> block to suffer the {{remainder}} of his sentence.|$|R

60|$|As Fetter and Potts <b>took</b> <b>the</b> animals out, Gilroy {{worked to}} untie the sturdy mare {{belonging}} to Hank Leeson. This was a pet animal, {{and not used}} to strangers. As Gilroy caught hold of <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> she gave a neigh of suspicion.|$|R
50|$|Halters {{are often}} plain in design, used as working {{equipment}} {{on a daily}} basis. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> a lead line, lead shank or lead rope is required to actually lead or tie the animal. It is most often attached to <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> at a point under the jaw, or less often, at the cheek, usually with a snap, but occasionally spliced directly onto <b>the</b> <b>halter.</b> A standard working lead rope is approximately 9 to 12 ft long.|$|R
50|$|A lead {{most often}} {{attaches}} to <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> with a sturdy snap. In some cases, the lead is tied or spliced permanently to <b>the</b> <b>halter.</b> A lead for a horse usually {{is in the}} range of 9 to 12 ft long, but longer and shorter lengths are seen.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>halter</b> hitch {{is a type}} of knot used {{to connect}} a rope to an object. As the name implies it is useful in tying the lead rope, which is {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> to a post or hitching rail. The benefit of <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> hitch is that it can be released by pulling {{on one end of the}} rope. Even if there is tension on the rope, it can still be released with ease. Some sources show the knot being finished with the free end running through the slipped loop to prevent it from working loose or being untied by a clever animal, still allowing easy but not instant untying.|$|R
5000|$|Under the chin: {{the shank}} is {{run through the}} lower left ring of <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> under <b>the</b> chin, through the lower right ring of <b>the</b> <b>halter,</b> and {{attached}} either back to itself or to the upper right ring. This tends to make a horse raise his head, but also has a stronger disciplinary effect. The chain, if too short to be attached back on itself, can also be run through the left ring and attached to the right ring, though <b>the</b> <b>halter</b> may also be moved off-center when the shank is applied, and the snap {{may be subject to}} pressure that may cause it to fail.|$|R
