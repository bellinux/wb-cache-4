5|$|An ale with {{a reddish}} <b>tinge</b> {{introduced}} in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream {{spore print}} {{with a slight}} salmon <b>tinge.</b> The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 {{micrometre}} (μm) which are joined by a well-developed network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11μm by 6.5–9μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish <b>tinge</b> when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 20-24 mm. The forewings are ochreous-yellow <b>tinged</b> with brownish {{towards the}} termen. The stigmata is brownish. The hindwings are light grey, <b>tinged</b> with pale ochreous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 46 mm. The forewings are uniform glossy grey-brown <b>tinged</b> with purple. The hindwings are glossy grey-brown <b>tinged</b> with purple, the inner area slightly paler.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are whitish, irregularly <b>tinged</b> {{with pale}} brownish grey and scattered with fuscous scales. The dorsal half is <b>tinged</b> with pale brownish grey. The hindwings are light grey.|$|R
5|$|A green <b>tinge</b> in {{the skin}} is {{sometimes}} associated with nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive <b>tinge,</b> and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive <b>tinge</b> on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies {{are larger than}} those of M. l. leucopterus but have a shorter tail. The female has a more cinnamon <b>tinge</b> to her plumage than the grey-brown {{of the other two}} subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings are elongate and light grey, partially <b>tinged</b> with whitish, {{although they are}} <b>tinged</b> brownish towards the apex. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are ashen white {{sprinkled with}} numerous small dark brown dots, {{a row of}} which extends along the entire costal margin which is also <b>tinged</b> with roseate. The wing beneath the fold to the dorsal margin is also somewhat <b>tinged</b> with roseate, with a few small brown spots. In some lights {{a large part of}} the wing appears strongly <b>tinged</b> with roseate.|$|R
50|$|The {{head and}} thorax are rufous {{with a few}} blackish scales. The abdomen is paler rufous. The {{forewings}} are bright rufous irrorated with black and slightly <b>tinged</b> with purple, the veins with slight pale streaks. The hindwings are ochreous <b>tinged</b> and irrorated with brown. The underside is reddish ochreous irrorated with dark brown, on the forewing <b>tinged</b> with purplish red.|$|R
5|$|This {{species may}} be {{confused}} with the related flame robin (P.phoenicea) and scarlet robin (P.boodang), but the male can be distinguished by its red crown (white in the other two species) and smaller size; furthermore, the male flame robin has dark grey rather than black upperparts. Female and immature birds are harder to distinguish, but can be differentiated by the reddish <b>tinge</b> of the crown and whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored <b>tinge</b> it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish <b>tinge</b> to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5000|$|... (Male) Head and thorax ochreous <b>tinged</b> with brown; {{antennae}} black-brown; palpi, pectus, {{and legs}} dark reddish brown, some yellow hair below shoulders, the femora yellow above; abdomen orange-yellow with brownish dorsal streak except on terminal segments, the ventral surface red-brown. Fore wing ochreous <b>tinged</b> with red-brown. Hind wing pale ochreous yellow, the underside <b>tinged</b> with red-brown except on inner area.|$|R
6000|$|But {{not before}} the warm life-blood [...] Had <b>tinged</b> with searching overflow, [...] More deeply <b>tinged</b> the {{embroidered}} show [...] Of His whose side was pierced upon the Rood! [...] 1837.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are white, faintly <b>tinged</b> with rufous {{and slightly}} irrorated with blackish. There {{is a black}} antemedial line and two similar medial lines. The hindwings are white, faintly <b>tinged</b> with rufous.|$|R
5|$|Bismuth is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink <b>tinge.</b> Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight <b>tinge</b> of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish <b>tinge</b> in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-22 mm. The forewings {{are white}} <b>tinged</b> with brown and irrorated with black. The antemedial line is double {{and filled with}} white. The hindwings are white, <b>tinged</b> with brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm. The forewings are pale greyish, mixed with yellow whitish and more yellowish <b>tinged</b> towards the dorsum. The hindwings are whitish, <b>tinged</b> greyish on the dorsal half.|$|R
5000|$|Head and thorax ochreous <b>tinged</b> with brown; abdomen ochreous white. Fore wing pale oehreous yellow faintly <b>tinged</b> with rufous and {{the veins}} {{slightly}} streaked with rufous; a slight blackish streak below basal half of cell some black scales at lower angle of cell; an oblique postmedial series of black points on veins 6 to 1; an oblique diffused rufous fascia from termen below apex to vein 3; a slight brown terminal line; cilia yellowish white {{with a faint}} brownish line through them. Hind wing white faintly <b>tinged</b> with ochreous; the underside white with the costal area <b>tinged</b> with ochreous.|$|R
5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden <b>tinge.</b> Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden <b>tinge</b> that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red <b>tinge,</b> unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is dark yellow, basally <b>tinged</b> orange towards {{the middle and}} mixed with rust terminally. The hindwings are brownish, slightly <b>tinged</b> orange.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 22 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is cream, <b>tinged</b> with brownish basally and dorsally {{and with}} some concolorous dots. The hindwings are cream <b>tinged</b> with brownish on the periphery.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 28 mm. The forewings are rather glossy indigo-green-blue, with the base <b>tinged</b> golden metallic and the terminal edge deep purple. The hindwings are dark grey, towards the dorsum <b>tinged</b> indigo.|$|R
5|$|On {{mainland}} Australia, {{it could}} {{be confused with the}} barking owl or the brown hawk-owl (Ninox scutulata), a rare vagrant to the northwest, however the southern boobook is easily distinguished by its squat posture and distinctive pale border to its face mask. The Tasmanian boobook has been recorded from southern Victoria, with one record from New South Wales. It has darker and more reddish upperparts with brighter white dots, with more prominent white dots and a yellow-brown <b>tinge</b> to the underparts. It has pinkish grey feet and golden eyes.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray <b>tinge,</b> resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E
5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the overall colour may have an orange-red <b>tinge.</b> As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is grey, <b>tinged</b> with brownish {{except for}} the terminal third and some small areas basally. The hindwings are cream, slightly <b>tinged</b> brownish towards the apex.|$|R
50|$|Head and thorax white {{suffused with}} brown; palpi pale yellow <b>tinged</b> with red at sides; pectus and legs ochreous <b>tinged</b> with brown; abdomen ochreous {{slightly}} irrorated with brown. Fore wing white suffused with pink especially on inner and terminal areas and slightly irrorated with brown; the costal edge white; the veins of terminal area slightly streaked with white; a faint brown fascia from base through the cell and thence obliquely to termen just below apex; a dark point in middle of cell; a terminal series of minute dark points. Hind wing white very faintly <b>tinged</b> with brown; the underside with the costa faintly <b>tinged</b> with pink and slightly irrorated with brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is white, in the basal part it is <b>tinged</b> with cream. The markings are black. The hindwings {{are white}} cream, slightly <b>tinged</b> with pale brownish posteriorly.|$|R
