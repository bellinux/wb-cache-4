25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses.</b> The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{deformation}} is {{a function}} of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied structural load. Depending on the magnitude of the applied stress and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a turbine blade will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> that might otherwise lead to cracking.|$|E
25|$|François Coignet was a French {{industrialist}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a pioneer in the}} development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete. Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures. In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did not do it for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning. In 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-storey house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} point of Monier's {{idea was that}} it combined steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or crushing strength, but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in tensile or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. But it is difficult and expensive to work up into customized forms. Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of tensile strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|E

2500|$|The {{outer layer}} is {{where most of}} the thickening, biomineralization and sclerotisation takes place, and its {{material}} tends to be strong under compressive stresses, though weaker under tension.

40|$|To {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of}} how opening-mode fractures (joints) form and open or close at depth in layered rocks, we present a 2 D numerical study aiming to determine whether <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> can develop in pre-fractured elastic multilayers submitted to biaxial compressive strain conditions. First, we investigate the role of the elastic and geometrical properties of the layers on the development of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models with five bonded layers and containing one open fracture in the central layer. Our results indicate that, in absence of elastic contrast (in Young's modulus) between the layers, no <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> develops in the models. However, when the fractured layer is stiffer than the two adjacent layers directly above and below, a lobe of horizontal <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> develops centered on the pre-existing fracture. The creation of this <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is contingent upon the partial closing of the fracture. The levels of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> and the thickness of the lobe of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> increase logarithmically with an increase in the elastic contrast and are systematically larger for a larger Soft/Stiff ratio (ratio of the total thickness of the soft layers with the total thickness of the stiff layers). Second, we investigate the role of fracture interaction in the development of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models containing a pair of open fractures. We observe that the levels of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in the region between the fractures are systematically higher than those observed in identical models containing a single fracture. This increase in <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> is very large for small elastic contrasts between the layers but diminishes when the elastic contrast increases. Furthermore, the spacing between the pre-existing fractures {{plays an important role in}} the stress distribution in the region between them. When the fracture spacing is equal to or lower than 1. 15 times the height of the fractured layer for the experimental conditions chosen, the lobes of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> centered on the fractures coalesce. This results in the formation of vast areas of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in models under remote compressive loading conditions. Such tensile areas are likely to allow the initiation and propagation of subsequent opening-mode fractures. The results obtained provide new insights into the formation of joints in layered rocks in compressive environments, with important consequences on fluid flow...|$|R

2500|$|Though enamel is {{described}} as tough, it has a similar brittleness to glass, [...] making it, unlike other natural crack-resistant laminate structures such as shell and nacre, potentially vulnerable to fracture. In spite of this it can withstand bite forces as high as 1,000 N many times a day during chewing. This resistance {{is due in part}} to the microstructure of enamel which contains processes, enamel tufts, that stabilize the growth of such fractures at the dentinoenamel junction.

2500|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) is {{a composite}} material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. [...] Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.|$|E
