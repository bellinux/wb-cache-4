25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|... "Hi, Infidelity" [...] {{was written}} by John Enbom and {{directed}} by Michael Fields, marking Enbom's twelfth writing credit and Fields's sixth directing credit for the series. The episode features the second of three appearances by Laura San Giacomo as Harmony Chase. She and Enrico Colantoni had become friends when they co-starred on the sitcom Just Shoot Me!. They rekindled their friendship during production of [...] "Charlie Don't Surf", San Giacomo's first appearance, so they lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate {{to go back to}} <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was really happy with how it played out." ...|$|E
500|$|Franken {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} in early 2004 to host a talk show for Air America Radio's flagship program with co-host Katherine Lanpher, who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named The O'Franken Factor but renamed The Al Franken Show on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, {{five days a week}} for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived was the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: [...] "I'm doing <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want to use my energies to get Bush unelected," [...] he told a New York Times reporter in 2004. Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, {{at the end of which}} he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.|$|E

500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, so I try to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> enjoy playing simply. I never feel angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E

The move was condemned by the musical {{director of the}} Israel Philharmonic Orchestra Zubin Mehta and members of Knesset. Prior to receiving the $100,000 Wolf Prize, awarded annually in Israel, Barenboim said, [...] "If people were really hurt, of course I regret <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don’t want to harm anyone".|$|E

[...] When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied [...] "I do <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> love what I do... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do." [...] "Walking the wire to me is life," [...] he adds. [...] Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road.|$|E

Wilson returned {{to his home in}} Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't really know how to speak on <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared.

2500|$|Two {{allegations}} were made against another Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe. The {{first to be}} made public involves a 1996 rafting trip Kolbe took on the Colorado River with two recently graduated, 17-year-old male pages, as well as Kolbe's sister, five of his staffers, and Gary Cummins, the deputy superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park at the time. An anonymous participant told NBC that he was [...] "creeped out" [...] by the attention Kolbe paid {{to one of the}} pages, adding that Kolbe did a lot of [...] "fawning, petting and touching" [...] on the teenager's arms, shoulders and back. The page in question declined to address that statement, telling NBC, [...] "I just don't want to get into <b>this...</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> might possibly be considered for a job in the administration." [...] He did say that he had a [...] "blast" [...] on the trip and did not report anything improper to his parents or page officials afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Standing Bear ("Mato Naji"), an Oglala Lakota chief, and {{well-known}} statesman and elder in the Native American community, recruited and commissioned Polish-American sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski {{to build}} the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. In October 1931, Luther Standing Bear, Henry's older brother, wrote sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who was carving the heads of four American presidents at Mount Rushmore. Luther suggested {{that it would be}} [...] "most fitting to have the face of Crazy Horse sculpted there. Crazy Horse is the real patriot of the Sioux tribe and the only one worthy to place by the side of Washington and Lincoln." [...] Borglum never replied. Thereafter, Henry Standing Bear began a campaign to have Borglum carve an image of Crazy Horse on Mt. Rushmore. In summer of 1935, Standing Bear, frustrated over the stalled Crazy Horse project, wrote to James H. Cook, a long time friend of Chief Red Cloud's [...] "I am struggling hopelessly with <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am without funds, no employment and no assistance from any Indian or White." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am grateful to you for <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
2500|$|While in prison, the poisoners {{agreed to}} name other poisoners {{so they would}} not undergo any torture. Their testimonies were fabricated. Then Françoise Filastre, a worker in the {{household}} of the Fontanges was arrested, she admitted to be a poisoner and abortionist, she entered the trial of Marie Angélique. When asked about what she knew about the duchess' strange death, Filastre panicked and admitted that Montespan hired her to perform the murder on Fontanges. [...] Montespan wished death on her young rival so she could regain {{the love of the}} king. Later Filastre said about her statements: [...] "All I said is false. I did that for me to be free of pain and torment. I say all <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do not want to kill the guilty conscience of a lie." [...] however she was executed by burning in Paris after Marguerite Monvoisin accused her of a child sacrifice. Though many believed the Duchess was indeed poisoned by Madame de Montespan, the evidence by the witnesses whom later denied every statements from them as false made it impossible for the court to determine Montespan as the actual murderer.|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E

2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
