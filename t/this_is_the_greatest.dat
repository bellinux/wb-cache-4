25|$|Cancrocaeca xenomorpha {{is a small}} crab {{with long}} legs. It has no eyes or even vestiges of eyestalks, and has only vague {{depressions}} where the orbits of the eyes might be expected; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> degree of ocular degeneration of any crab. The carapace is rounded in outline, without any rostrum, and is slightly wider than it is long. The five pairs of legs are very long, at up to 3.7 times {{the width of the}} carapace in length.|$|E

We don’t mean that as a criticism of nuclear power’s practitioners, on whose skill and devotion we all continue to depend; the impressive operational improvements in U.S. power reactors in recent years deserve great credit. It is simply how technologies and markets evolved, despite the best intentions and immense effort. In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E

The Knobstone Escarpment begins in the southeastern part of the county, rising sharply at the Ohio River, and {{following}} a course roughly along {{the eastern edge of}} the county.

500|$|Following the ceremony, {{an evening}} rally {{of more than}} 1,000 people in Oslo called for Liu's release. The marchers headed for the Grand Hotel, where laureates {{traditionally}} greet the crowd from the balcony. Assembled Chinese activists and dissidents said they were inspired by the award, {{that it was a}} much-needed morale-booster, and expressed hope {{that it would be a}} catalyst to resurrect the moribund Chinese pro-democracy movement. Yang Jianli said: [...] "The most important change is the change in people's hearts... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> achievement ," [...] The Global Times said of the ceremony: [...] "It’s unimaginable that such a farce, the like of which is more commonly seen in cults, is being staged on the civilised continent of Europe". On the other hand, a huge image with three empty chairs and five cranes adorned the front page the edition of 12 December of the Southern Metropolis Daily; ambiguously, the headline read: [...] "2010 Asian Para Games Are Ready to Start Tonight in Guangzhou". China Digital Times offered the interpretation that 'crane' in Chinese (he) is a homonym for 'congratulations' and the first character of 'peace'.|$|E

500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|The costumes for {{the tour}} were created by {{designer}} Arianne Phillips. Before the show started, USA Today reported that Madonna would be making five costume changes in the tour. Phillips commented that since Madonna was revisiting her old songs for this tour, hence {{that was the main}} philosophy and inspiration behind designing the costumes. However she also noted that [...] "Madonna has always pooh-poohed the concept of reinvention and doesn't strategize or premeditate her new look in a boardroom, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> ironic statement of all." [...] The T-shirts were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the shoes used were provided by clothing line hosiery Miu Miu. The opening dress was created by French designer Christian Lacroix and incorporated the baroque look. The second part of the displayed military themed outfits inspired from the American Life album and designed by Phillips. The third ensemble emphasized on the emotional point of the show and hence the costumes were quieter and displayed the silhouettes of the performers. The costumes of this segment were designed by Stella McCartney. Phase four costumes, inspired by the carnivals, were designed by Chanel. The final segment of the tour displayed traditional dresses. Other than these, Madonna wore corsets during the first segment.|$|E
500|$|In Chapter 9, Hitchens {{contends that}} the claim that {{religion}} {{is a source of}} conflict is a [...] "cruel factual misunderstanding", and that a number of conflicts, including The Troubles and the Arab–Israeli conflict, were not motivated by religion but tribal in nature and disputes over territory. Chapter 10 discusses whether morality can be determined without the concept of God. Hitchens asserts that atheists [...] "have a fundamental inability to concede that to be effectively absolute, a moral code needs to be beyond human power to alter". He also describes as flawed his brother's assertion in God is Not Great that [...] "the order to love thy neighbour 'as thyself' is too extreme and too strenuous to be obeyed". Hitchens ends the chapter by stating, [...] "in all my experience in life, I have seldom seen a more powerful argument for the fallen nature of man, and his inability to achieve perfection, than those countries in which man sets himself up to replace God with the State". Hitchens begins Chapter 11 by asserting, [...] "those who reject God's absolute authority, preferring their own, are far more ready to persecute than Christians have been ... Each revolutionary generation reliably repeats the savagery". He cites as examples the French revolutionary terror; the Bolshevik revolution; the Holodomor and the Soviet famine of 1932–33; the barbarity surrounding Joseph Stalin's five-year plans, repeated in the Great Leap Forward in China; atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge; and human rights abuses in Cuba under Fidel Castro. Hitchens then quotes a number of prominent communist thinkers' pronouncements on morality, including George Lukacs stating, [...] "Communist ethics make it the highest duty to accept the necessity of acting wickedly. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> sacrifice the revolution asks from us", and Leon Trotsky's claiming that [...] "morality, more than any other form of ideology, has a class character".|$|E

Herman Melville lived for a year in one of the early rowhouses on the square. The rowhouse became the standard form as development continued to the west in later decades as the city industrialized. Today 92% of its nearly 600 buildings are 19th-century rowhouses in different architectural styles, predominantly Italianate, [...] many built as speculative housing for the city's middle class. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> concentration of such houses in the city of Albany.

2500|$|As a clear {{example of}} how context should be considered, in the Tale of the Years, the force that Aragorn leads to the Gates of Mordor is called the [...] "Host of the West" [...] {{and it does not}} have the {{strength}} estimate found above in the charts. But, in this context, the word Host is used as a general description of a disparate group of warriors from different armies, for whom specific numbers have preceded {{the use of the word}} elsewhere in the book. [...] Host of the West, as a title, indicates it is an encompassing phrase. In earlier chapters in The Return of the King, Tolkien consistently calls it an army initially, even having the character of Imrahil say ironically that, [...] " ... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power...".|$|E
