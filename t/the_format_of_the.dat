The stories were new stories {{based on the}} original stories, with Nancy solving mysteries with her friends George and Ned. Beginning in the second season, <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series changed {{to focus more on}} the Hardy Boys, with Nancy Drew primarily appearing as a guest star in several crossover story lines; Martin left the series midway through the second season and was replaced by 19-year-old Janet Louise Johnson for the final few episodes. The series continued for a third season as The Hardy Boys Mysteries, dropping Nancy Drew completely, but the series was eventually cancelled midway through the season.|$|E

5|$|For most of {{the history}} of the National League (94 years), the pennant was {{presented}} to the team with the best win–loss record at the end of the season. The first modern World Series was played in 1903, and after a hiatus in 1904, continued until 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason, and resumed in 1995. In 1969, the league split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the NLCS to determine the pennant winner. <b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NLCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball restructured the two divisions in each league into three. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as one wild card team, play in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play for the pennant.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E

The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. <b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ALCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in the 1985 postseason.

5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed to compete starting in 1998. <b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them.

5|$|Judge John Deed is a British legal drama {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC in association with One-Eyed Dog for BBC One. It was created by G.F.

It also stars Jenny Seagrove as the barrister Jo Mills QC, frequently the object of Deed's desire. A pilot episode was broadcast on 9 January 2001, followed by the first full series on 26 November 2001. The sixth and last series concluded on 18 January 2007. The programme then went on an indefinite break after Shaw became involved in another television programme, and he and Seagrove expressed a wish for <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series to change before they filmed new episodes.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cricket World Cup {{has changed}} greatly {{over the course}} of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four. The {{competition}} consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 {{as a result of the}} end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.

In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
