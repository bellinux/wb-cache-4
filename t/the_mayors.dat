5|$|Turkey has {{a unitary}} {{structure}} {{in terms of}} administration and this aspect {{is one of the}} most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration.

Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of <b>the</b> <b>mayors</b> (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents.

5|$|Van Roey {{made many}} of the church's {{resources}} available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning {{the treatment of the}} Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi repression of the Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation. In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts. At great personal risk, <b>the</b> <b>mayors,</b> led by Joseph Van De Meulebroeck, sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June. The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Liège, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began.|$|E
