5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January16 to {{the west}} of Diego Garcia, and that day Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January17. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> MF discontinued advisories after the system briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement {{to the west}}-southwest, and on January19 began intensifying. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S {{to the north of the}} northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January20.|$|E

5|$|The {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} spawned a tropical disturbance on January19, developing a circulation just west of St. Brandon. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> Météo-France on Réunion (MFR) classified {{the system as a}} tropical disturbance, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system as a low-pressure area a day prior. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Gretelle late on January20, by which time the JTWC gave it the designation Tropical Cyclone 20S. Due to a large ridge centered near Île Amsterdam, the storm tracked generally southwestward toward the Mascarene Islands. Early on January22, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, and later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> MFR upgraded Gretelle to tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Erika was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that had minor impacts in the Lesser Antilles. The fifth named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Erika originated {{out of a}} tropical wave on September1 near the Lesser Antilles. Although it was a disorganized system, it was immediately declared a tropical storm, rather than a tropical depression. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> system reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg). Increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken shortly thereafter, with Erika barely maintaining tropical storm-status by September2. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> storm passed over the island of Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea. On September3, Erika weakened to a tropical depression as the low pressure center became fully displaced from convective activity. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> system degenerated into a remnant low before dissipating near Puerto Rico on September4.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed east of Chuuk on July 31 and gradually increased in organization {{over the next}} several days as it moved northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{atmospheric}} convection developed and persisted on December 21 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal forming within an active near-equatorial trough. Located within an area of weak vertical wind shear, the system steadily organized, and after initially remaining nearly stationary it began to move slowly westward. Deep convection continued to develop, and on December 23 a mid-level circulation began to form. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. By {{the night of the}} December 23, a low-level circulation developed in the system, located to the south of the deep convection. The disturbance continued to organize, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifying it as a deep depression early on December 24. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> organization of the system degraded slightly, though it quickly reorganized. On December 25, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 04B while it was located about 155miles (250km) east of Sri Lanka. On the center's first advisory, the tropical storm was drifting west-northwest at 3mph (5km/h) with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). Shortly thereafter, the IMD upgraded the deep depression to a cyclonic storm as a central dense overcast developed over the center.|$|E
5|$|Another storm {{appeared}} {{east of the}} Philippines on May26, located {{south of}} Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, passing over Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at ¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June2. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> town of Basco, Batanes in the waterway recorded a pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). On June3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and recurved to the northeast. It was last noted on June6 {{just south of the}} Japanese island of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, Easter Monday and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. <b>That</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples. (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued into a public hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Depression Two {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche on June18, the Government of Mexico issued a {{tropical}} storm watch for coastal areas between Punta El Lagarto and Barra Da Nautla. The watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning early on June19. Following the storm's intensification <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> warning was expanded northward to Tuxpan. Officials dispatched 34,250workers to set up refugee camps throughout the state. Across Veracruz, approximately 2,000people sought refuge in shelters.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move northwestward, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W {{on the morning}} of September 10. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> tropical depression moved into the PAGASA Area of Responsibility, and was named Luis. As the system continued to strengthen, the JMA upgraded the depression to a storm at 1200 UTC and named it Shanshan, a girls' given name submitted by Hong Kong. The HKO did the same at the same time, upgrading the depression to a storm.|$|E
5|$|Bret {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on August5. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August15 in the western Caribbean Sea, and spawned a low-pressure area. Convective activity developed around the low, and by August18 the system was over the Yucatán Peninsula. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00pm CDT (1800UTC), the third of the 1999 season. Initially, moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system. By August19, the wind shear relented, allowing deep convection to develop over the center; later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret. A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north. By the morning of August20, rainbands began to form.|$|E

5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>the</b> system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Chevron Corporation and Shell Oil Company {{evacuated}} offshore crews {{from the}} Gulf of Mexico on September16 {{in preparation for}} a possible hurricane threat from Hurricane Gordon, even though there was little effect on oil and gas production before <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> Chevron Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700on September16 to 450the next day. Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at sea for one day.
