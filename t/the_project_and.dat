5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale {{felt that}} it was time to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> Kneale's scripts were {{produced}} in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled Quatermass.|$|E

5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited {{because most of the}} nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project.

Despondent at the failure of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E

Environmentalists, who opposed the project, celebrated its cancellation.|$|E
5|$|In a dispute, the {{architectural}} firm of Miller and Pflueger {{was fired from}} <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by Lewis P. Hobart.

5|$|Oliphant {{secured the}} {{services}} of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey, {{who had been working}} for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of the}} Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> had Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed Stanley Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone.

He also restarted a project to build the Cámpora Highway linking Dellepiane Avenue with the Riachuelo, and established the first non-recreational bikeway in Buenos Aires at Avenida del Libertador.|$|E
5|$|After Young Frankenstein was written, {{the rights}} {{were to be}} sold to Columbia Pictures, but after having trouble agreeing on the budget, Wilder, Brooks, and {{producer}} Michael Gruskoff went with 20th Century Fox, where both Brooks and Wilder had to sign five-year contracts. Young Frankenstein was a commercial success, with Wilder and Brooks receiving Best Adapted Screenplay nominations at the 1975 Oscars, losing to Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adaptation of The Godfather Part II. While filming Young Frankenstein, Wilder had an idea for a romantic musical comedy about a brother of Sherlock Holmes. Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn agreed to participate in <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>and</b> Wilder began writing what became his directorial début, 1975's The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother.|$|E
