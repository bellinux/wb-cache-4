40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in the modern}} world. They are microcomputers most often included incomplete devices consisting of software and hardware. Embedded systems range from small devices to large systems monitoring and controlling complex processes. Design and development of such systems is a complex task, since embedded systems often need to fulfill extra-functional requirements, on top of functional ones, within constrained amounts of platform resources. Some embedded systems are mission critical; hence, {{they are not allowed}} to fail during the mission. One way to ensure that a system works in accordance to its specification is to define the system in an Architecture Description Language (ADL) and apply formal verification methods. The Architecture Design and Analysis Language (AADL) has become popular in the avionic and automobile industry, and is equipped with several annexes, among them the Behavior Annex. However, AADL still misses a formal semantics, which prevents the possibility to prove correctness of architecture features by performing model checking on AADL models. Moreover, AADL does not support time annotations, which prevents modeling of real-time systems in AADL. In this thesis, we address these issues by presenting a formal analysis framework including a denotationalsemantics for a subset of the AADL and its Behavior Annex, which evaluates properties defined in Computation Tree Logic (CTL) by providing model checking. Model checking is a formal verification method that has proved to be powerful as well as effective. Our AADL-semantics is supported by a tool with an implementation of the semantics in Standard ML, which in turn is encapsulated in an Eclipse plugin. We also present a time annotation extension of AADL, implemented in a tool <b>translating</b> <b>time</b> annotated AADL and its Behavior Annex into the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) for simulation of real-time features. Another closely related problem is how to achieve optimal component distribution; in order to address this issue we have developed a tool that perform near-optional component distribution in regard to a series of parameters. The research results, which have been validated thought case studies, provides the possibility for a system engineer to model a system and prove its correctness. The research has been conducted {{in the context of the}} PROGRESS research center, for predictable embedded software systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{considering}} {{some problems}} encountered when we <b>translate</b> <b>time</b> expressions between Korean and Indonesian. We consider {{in this paper}} the time expressions corresponding to the questions of type what time or when, rather than those related to the questions of type how long or how often. Especially the time expressions referring to calendar, day and clock time in Indonesian and Korean are considered in this study. Our discussion underlines four different aspects in <b>translating</b> the <b>time</b> expressions between these two languages: word order, numeral system, abbreviation, and time segmentation. The LGG(Local Grammar Graph) model {{will be used in}} the description of these aspects. The result of our study {{can be used as a}} linguistic resource not only for the learning system of Indonesian and Korean, but also for the machine translation system between these two languages...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} coloured Petri net {{models of}} so-called timed influence nets with logic. Previous work {{has developed a}} method to <b>translate</b> a <b>timed</b> influence net into a coloured Petri net. The work in this paper describes {{a new and more}} compact translation from timed influence nets with logic into coloured Petri nets. The translation has the property that the net structure of the coloured Petri net will be the same for all <b>translated</b> <b>timed</b> influence nets – only the initial marking changes depending on the actual timed influence net. This more compact translation avoids the generation of simulation code for each timed influence net. The paper also presents some validation results to establish that the coloured Petri net models from the two methods are equivalent, i. e. that the new compact coloured Petri net model gives the same simulation results as the old less compact model does...|$|R
