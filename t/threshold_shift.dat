50|$|Auditory fatigue {{is defined}} as a {{temporary}} loss of hearing after exposure to sound. This results in a temporary shift of the auditory threshold known as a temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> (TTS). The damage can become permanent (permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shift,</b> PTS) if sufficient recovery time is not allowed for before continued sound exposure. When the hearing loss is rooted from a traumatic occurrence, it may be classified as noise-induced hearing loss, or NIHL.|$|E

50|$|The {{temperature}} and heat {{levels of the}} body are directly correlated with the temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> of the ear. When the levels of blood temperature increase, these <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> increase as well. The transduction of sounds requires an oxygen supply that will be readily depleted due to the prolonged <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Long-term fatigue {{is defined}} as full {{recovery}} from temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> taking at least several minutes to occur. Recovery {{can take up to}} several days. <b>Threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> that result in long-term fatigue are dependent on level of sound and length of exposure.|$|R

50|$|The average noise {{exposure}} in a kennel {{is greater than}} 100 dB SPL. According to OSHA these levels would yield {{in the use of}} hearing protection for the workers of those kennels due to the risk of noise induced hearing loss. The anatomical structures of the human and canine ear are very similar, so it is thought that these levels will negatively impact the hearing of canines in kennels. The ABR can be used to estimate the hearing threshold of canines, and can be used to show either a temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> or permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> after being exposed to excessive sound levels.|$|E
5000|$|Hazardous {{industrial}} noise {{can cause a}} permanent auditory <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> as excessive exposure to loud noises can damage the Hair cells in the ear.

Two crewmen experienced a small hearing decrement in-chamber, but there was no pattern as to the ear and frequency affected.

These postchamber <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> were perhaps the most significant finding of the study. However, no lasting detrimental effects on the crew's hearing were found...|$|R
40|$|Psychophysical forward masking is an {{increase}} in threshold of detection of a sound (probe) when it is preceded by another sound (masker). This is reminiscent of the reduction in neuronal responses to a sound following prior stimulation. Studies in the auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus using signal detection theory techniques to derive neuronal thresholds showed that in centrally projecting neurons, increases in masked thresholds were significantly smaller than the changes measured psychophysically. Larger <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> {{have been reported in the}} inferior colliculus of awake marmoset. The present study investigated the magnitude of forward masking in primary auditory cortical neurons of anaesthetised guinea-pigs. Responses of cortical neurons to unmasked and forward masked tones were measured and probe detection thresholds estimated using signal detection theory methods. <b>Threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> were larger than in the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus. The larger <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> suggest that central, and probably cortical, processes contribute to forward masking. However, although methodological differences make comparisons difficult, the <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> in cortical neurons were, in contrast to subcortical nuclei, actually larger than those observed psychophysically. Masking was largely attributable to a reduction in the responses to the probe, rather than either a persistence of the masker responses or {{an increase}} in the variability of probe responses...|$|R
50|$|Audiometric {{testing is}} a very {{important}} part of a hearing conservation program. Audiometric testing allows for the identification of those that have lost significant hearing. Additionally, the testing allows for the identification of those who are in process of losing their hearing. Audiometric testing is most important in identifying those who have permanent hearing loss. This is called noise-induced permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> (NIPTS).|$|E
50|$|Lin et al., {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} Taiwan that tested the effect of generation of reactive oxygen species on temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> and noise-induced hearing loss. Subjects were employees at a steel manufacturing company and each one was assessed for personal noise exposure during work shifts. Statistical analysis yielded a correlation between exposure of higher-frequency sounds to lower temporary threshold shifts and greater levels of tiredness and hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|The second {{aspect is}} the {{audiometric}} testing program. Employees exposed to levels {{at or above}} the EAV will undergo audiometric testing. The first test is called a baseline. It provides a standard to compare future audiometric tests to. If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard <b>threshold</b> <b>shift)</b> greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure.|$|E

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has created a checklist to help {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a hearing conservation program. It can be found on their website.

50|$|The {{pressure}} at which sound becomes painful for a listener is the pain threshold pressure {{for that person}} at that time. The threshold pressure for sound varies with frequency and can be age-dependent. People who {{have been exposed to}} more noise/music usually have a higher threshold pressure. <b>Threshold</b> <b>shift</b> can also cause threshold pressure to vary. Prolonged exposure to sound at levels evoking pain can cause physical damage, potentially leading to hearing impairment.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{effects to}} {{excessive}} noise exposure include hiding, urinating, defecating, panting, pacing, drooling, disregard to commands, trembling, and barking. These behavioral patterns pose {{a much greater}} problem to canines than meets the eye. All of these behavioral patterns are characteristics that result in a longer stay at the kennels before being adopted. A longer stay at the shelter results in a longer duration of noise exposure and therefore more likely to show either a temporary or permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> in the canineâ€™s hearing.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy of}} cochlear infusion of methylprednisolone (MP) after an impulse noise trauma (170 dB SPL peak) was evaluated in guinea pigs. The compound action potential <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> were measured over a 14 days recovery period after the gunshot exposure. For each animal, {{one of the}} cochlea was perfused directly into the scala tympani with MP during 7 days via a mini-osmotic pump, whereas the other cochlea was not pump-implanted. The functional study of hearing was supplemented by histological analysis. Forty eight hours after the trauma, significant differences between auditory <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> in the implanted and non-implanted ears were observed for frequencies above 8 kHz. At day 7, the difference was significant for only one frequency and no difference was observed after 14 days recovery. Cochleograms showed that the hair cell losses were significantly lower in the MP treated ears. This work indicates that direct infusion of MP into perilymphatic space accelerates hearing recovery, reduces hair cell losses after impulse noise trauma but does not limit permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts...</b>|$|R

Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, {{is one of}} the most common conditions impacting the aging population, characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss and impairment in speech discrimination capability. Current management is limited to auditory rehabilitation with the assistance of hearing aids or cochlear implants in advanced cases.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a combination antioxidant therapy in the prevention and treatment of presbycusis. The objectives of this randomized controlled animal study were to: identify an anesthetic which would allow for repeated reliable longitudinal auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing in a mouse model, identify a combination antioxidant which targets multiple sites within the oxidative pathway and assess its ability to prevent age-related <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> and to arrest further age-related <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> in C 57 BL 6 mice with documented age-related <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts.</b> Mice were randomized to one of three groups: an early treatment group, a late treatment group, or a control group.

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) applied {{over the}} occipital pole {{is able to}} suppress the perception of visual stimuli. This suppression {{is based on a}} shift of the perception threshold. Here we compared the modulatory effect of a light flash with the suppression effect of TMS. Subjects had to report the orientation of a flashed hook. At two different adaptation levels (0. 3 and 3 cd m- 2) we determined contrast thresholds by the method of constant stimuli. A light flash (15 or 150 cd m- 2 for the different adaptation levels) was applied with different SOAs after the appearance of the hook, and <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> were measured. Similarly, <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> due to focal TMS with SOAs from - 25 to + 195 ms were measured. With high background intensity, TMS <b>shifted</b> <b>thresholds</b> up to 1. 2 Weber contrast units (WC), and with low background intensity the shift was up to 6. 6 WC. Latency for the maximal effect was shorter at the high background level (85 ms SOA) than at the lower level (115 ms SOA). We found similar effects on <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> with light flashes at SOAs from 20 to 80 ms.

50|$|Additionally, {{clinical}} trials using antioxidants after a traumatic noise event to reduce {{reactive oxygen species}} have displayed promising results. Antibiotic injections with allopurinol, lazaroids, Î±-D-tocopherol, and mannitol were found to reduce the <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> after noise exposure. Another antioxidant, Ebselen, {{has been shown to}} have promising results for both TTS and PTS. Ebselen mimics gluthathione peroxide, an enzyme that has many functions, including scavenging hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species. After noise exposure, gluthathione peroxide decreases in the ear. An oral administration of ebselen in both preclinical tests on guinea pigs and human trials indicate that noise induced TTS and PTS was reduced.|$|E
50|$|The safe {{amount of}} {{exposure}} {{is reduced by}} a factor of 2 for every exchange rate (3 dB for NIOSH standard or 5 dB for OSHA standard) increase in SPL. For example, the safe daily exposure amount at 85 dB (90 dB for OSHA) is 8 hours, while the safe exposure at 94 dB(A) (nightclub level) is only 1 hours. Noise trauma can also cause a reversible hearing loss, called a temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shift.</b> This typically occurs in individuals who are exposed to gunfire or firecrackers, and hear ringing in their ears after the event (tinnitus).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We {{estimated}} the noise exposure of crews working in alpine helicopter rescue systems. Methods: Noise {{levels of the}} the helicopters used (Alouette III, Alouette II â€˜Lamaâ€™, Ecureuil and BK 117) were measured with a device according to class 2 DIN IEC 651. These data were combined with the flight data of the personnel to evaluate the equivalent noise level according to DIN 45645 - 2.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) can be used to predict psychophysical electrical-field interaction patterns obtained with simultaneous stimulation of intracochlear electrodes. The second goal was to determine whether ECAP patterns are affected by recording location because differences might influence the relation between ECAP and psychophysical measures. The third goal was to investigate whether symmetrical <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> are produced with phase inversion of the interaction stimulus. Nine adults with Advanced Bionics cochlear implants participated. ECAP and psychophysical thresholds were obtained for basal, middle, and apical probe electrodes in the presence of a subthreshold interaction stimulus delivered simultaneously to each of seven to eight interaction electrodes per probe. The results showed highly significant correlations between ECAP and psychophysical <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> for all nine subjects, which suggests that the ECAP can adequately predict psychophysical electrical-field interaction patterns for subthreshold stimuli. ECAP thresholds were significantly higher for recordings from the basal (versus apical) side of the probe, which suggests that recording location may affect relations between ECAP and psychophysical measures. Interaction stimulus phase inversion generally produced symmetrical <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> for psychophysical measures but not for half of ECAP measures...|$|R
50|$|Cody and Johnstone (1982) and Rajan and Johnstone (1988a; 1988b) {{showed that}} {{constant}} acoustic stimulation (which evokes a strong MOCS response (Brown et al., 1998)) reduced {{the severity of}} acoustic trauma. This protection was negated {{in the presence of}} a chemical known to suppress the action of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB) (strychnine), implicating the action of the MOCS in protection of the cochlea from loud sounds. Further evidence for the auditory efferents having a protective role was provided by Rajan (1995a) and Kujawa and Liberman (1997). Both studies showed that the hearing loss sustained by animals due to binaural sound exposure was more severe if the OCB was severed. Rajan (1995b) also showed a frequency dependence of MOC protection roughly consistent with the distribution of MOC fibres in the cochlea. Other studies supporting this function of the MOCS have shown that MOC stimulation reduces the temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> (TTS) and permanent <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> (PTS) associated with prolonged noise exposure (Handrock and Zeisberg, 1982; Rajan, 1988b; Reiter and Liberman, 1995), and that animals with the strongest MOC reflex sustain less hearing damage to loud sounds (Maison and Liberman, 2000). This proposed biological role of the MOCS, protection from loud sounds, was challenged by Kirk and Smith (2003), who argued that the intensity of sounds used in the experiments (â‰¥105 dB SPL) would rarely or never occur in nature, and therefore a protective mechanism for sounds of such intensities could not have evolved. This claim (that MOC-mediated cochlear protection is an epiphenomenon) was recently challenged by Darrow et al. (2007), who suggested that the LOCS has an anti-excitotoxic effect, indirectly protecting the cochlea from damage.|$|E
50|$|Periodic {{audiometric}} monitoring, typically completed annually {{as recommended}} by OSHA, can identify changes in hearing. There are specific criteria that the change must meet in order to require action. The criterion most commonly used is the standard <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> (STS), defined by a change of 10 dB or greater averaged at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz. Age correction factors {{can be applied to}} the change in order to compensate for hearing loss that is age-related rather than work-related. If an STS is found, OSHA requires that the employee be notified of this change within 21 days. Furthermore, any employee that is not currently wearing HPD is now required to wear protection. If the employee is already wearing protection, they should be refit with a new device and retrained on appropriate use.|$|E
50|$|The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{requires}} that all feasible engineering and administrative controls {{be employed to}} reduce miners' exposure levels to 90 dBA TWA. The action level for enrollment in a hearing conservation program is 85 dBA 8-hour TWA, integrating all sound levels between 80 dBA to at least 130 dBA. MSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate (the sound level in decibels {{that would result in}} halving an increase in sound level or a doubling a decrease.in sound level the allowable exposure time to maintain the same noise dose). At and above exposure levels of 90 dBA TWA, the miner must wear hearing protection. At and above exposure levels above 105 dBA TWA, the miner must wear dual hearing protection. Miners may not be exposed to sounds exceeding 115 dBA with or without hearing protection devices. MSHA defines a standard <b>threshold</b> <b>shift</b> as an average decrease in auditory sensitivity of 10 dB HL at the frequencies 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz. (30 CFR Part 62).|$|E
40|$|In many {{contexts}} reported {{outcomes in}} a rating scale are modeled through {{the existence of}} a latent variable that separates the categories through thresholds. The literature {{has not been able to}} separate the effect of a variable on the latent variable from its effect on threshold parameters. We propose a model which incorporates (1) individual fixed effects on the latent variable, (2) individual fixed effects on the thresholds and (3) <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> across time depending on observable. Importantly, the latent variable and the threshold specifications can include common variables. In order to illustrate the estimator, we apply it to a model of life satisfaction using the GSOEP dataset. We demonstrate that important differences can arise depending on the choice of the model. Our model suggests that <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> are statistically and quantitatively important. Factors which increase reported life-satisfaction are due both to positive effects on the latent variable AND to <b>shifting</b> <b>thresholds</b> to the left, while factors which decrease reported life satisfaction are due to negative effects on the latent variable AND to <b>shifting</b> <b>thresholds</b> to the right...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a break in music exposure on temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts.</b> Design: A cross-over design where subjects are exposed to dance music for either two hours consecutively, or exposed to two hours of dance music with a one-hour break in between. Outcome measure was the change in hearing threshold, measured in 1 -dB steps at different time points after ending the music. Study sample: Eighteen normal-hearing subjects participated in this study. Results: Changes in pure-tone threshold were observed in both conditions and were similar, regardless of the break. <b>Threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> could be averaged for 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The shift immediately after the ending of the music was 1. 7 dB for right ears, and 3. 4 dB for left ears. The difference between left and right ears was significant. One hour after the exposure, right ears were recovered to baseline conditions whereas left ears showed a small but clinically irrelevant remaining shift of approximately 1 dB. Conclusions: The advice to use chill-out zones is still valid, because this helps to reduce the duration to the exposure. This study does not provide evidence that a rest period gives an additional reduction of temporary <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts...</b>|$|R

Immunohistochemistry labeling {{was employed to}} trace RIBEYE, a major presynaptic componment of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE/CtBP 2 expression levels were assessed and compared with hearing <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts.</b> Auditory function was assessed by auditory brainstem responses. The stereocilia of outer hair cells (OHCs) and IHCs was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ResultsHearing thresholds were elevated with peak hearing loss observed on the 7 th day after gentamicin exposure, followed by improvement after the 7 th day. RIBEYE/CtBP 2 expression directly correlated with observed hearing <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts.</b> Strikingly, we did not see any obvious changes in stereocilia in both OHCs and IHCs until the 28 th day. Mild changes in stereocilia were only observed in OHCs on the 28 th day. ConclusionsThese findings indicate that presynapse cochlear ribbons, rather than stereocilia, may be sensitive to aminoglycoside ototoxic exposure in mice cochleae. A pattern of RIBEYE/CtBP 2 expression changes seems to parallel hearing <b>threshold</b> <b>shifts</b> and suggests presynaptic response properties to lower dosage of aminoglycoside ototoxic stimuli...|$|R
