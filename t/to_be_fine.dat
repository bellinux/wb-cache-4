The {{original}} story was written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the co-directors and design team. It was subsequently handed over to Christian Divine and Cano <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> tuned in English. Story and character development were highlighted over point-and-click puzzles, making choice and consequence integral to how the narrative unfolds. Hannah Telle auditioned for Max Caulfield in July 2014 and was offered the part; Ashly Burch auditioned for both Max and her given role Chloe Price. The recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype.|$|E

25|$|In {{the movie}} Half Ticket, {{for one of}} the songs - Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe - the music {{director}} Salil Chowdhary had a duet in mind and wanted Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before she could return, Kishore Kumar solved the problem by singing both the male and female parts of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kishore Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> as he did admirably well singing both in male and female voices.|$|E

Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as she appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> They did, however, state that they believed the call to be genuine. On June 24, 2008, she checked into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological ailments including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Her agent confirmed that she was suffering from anxiety and depression. On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.|$|E

The vessels {{are for the most}} part painted according to a standard formula, with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions. Anthony's style is signified by a [...] "naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern [...] consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour".|$|E

500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E
500|$|Boosinger {{called the}} game too easy and streamlined, {{and found the}} Logic system to be too simple. He did however feel that finding contradictions in testimonies was [...] "fantastic as always", while too reliant on trial and error. Ronaghan said that many {{solutions}} in the Rebuttal phases are [...] "binary" [...] - while {{it makes sense to}} present a piece of evidence at several points, the game accepts only one of them. He found the controls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> but called the touch screen-based walking controls [...] "awkward and imprecise". Goldstein similarly found problems with multiple pieces of evidence that all could point to the same contradiction, but where the game would only allow a specific one. At other times, she said that no reasonable solution could be found, forcing her to guess. John Walker at Eurogamer also complained about how reasonable solutions sometimes are not accepted. Hopper said that solving cases isn't intuitive enough, and involves a lot of trial and error. While some puzzles made sense to him, others were frustrating. Parker called the gameplay exciting, and said that the game has depth and variety, but that it is too easy at times.|$|E

[...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared {{at the thought of}} that." ...|$|E

His net worth is about $2 billion. On his first day, he allows an {{oncologist}} to avoid jail for cheating the Montecito by making him lose his winnings and promise not to return to Las Vegas again. In [...] "Run Cooper Run", Cooper was revealed as a black ops Marine in the Vietnam War and awarded the Bronze Star for his work. He was a Marine {{who served in the}} Battle of Khe Sanh, a 77-day siege in which outnumbered Marines fought off and killed between 10 and 15 thousand NVA regulars as told by Danny in the episode. In [...] "Sex, Lies and Lamaze", Cooper admits that he was best friends with Piper's father, a fellow Marine. Before Piper's father died, Cooper promised he would watch over Piper. Cooper also owns condominiums in Florida, the largest paper mill in Wisconsin, the largest cattle ranch in Wyoming, and a high-tech company in California. In the season-five finale, Cooper tells the Montecito workers he must go to New York and take care of some lawsuits filed against him by Vic Manning. Later, Mitch alerts Danny that the Montecito's jet has crashed in Colorado. The news reports say only one of the pilots survived. In lieu of the planned triple wedding, Danny and Mike set up a memorial service for Cooper's presumed death.

2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 14, 2012 by actor/comedian Chris Rock, who is a longtime friend and fan of the band. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (who was represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez. Frusciante did not attend the ceremony. Smith said [...] "We asked him, he said, 'I'm just not really comfortable with that, but good luck and thanks for inviting me.' He's the kind of guy, I think, that once he's finished with something he's just on to the next phase of his life. The Chili Peppers are not really on his radar right now." [...] Despite recording one album with the band, Dave Navarro and Jack Sherman were the only two former recording band members not inducted. Kiedis explained that Navarro, who appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> with not being included, was better suited for induction as a member of Jane's Addiction, the band he was best known for. Sherman on the other hand was angry about not being included and spoke out about the band's induction blaming the band for not including him or Navarro by saying he was told only original members, current members and those who played on multiple albums were eligible for induction (although this has proven to not be the case with other inductees). [...] "It appeared to be a politically correct way of omitting Dave Navarro and I for whatever reasons they have that are probably the band's and not the Hall's," [...] Sherman also said [...] "It's really painful to see all this celebrating going on and be excluded. I'm not claiming that I've brought anything other to the band... but to have soldiered on under arduous conditions {{to try to make the}} thing work, and I think that's what you do in a job, looking back. And that's been dishonored. I'm being dishonored, and it sucks." [...] During his induction speech, Smith made sure to thank all of the band members, past and present including Sherman, Navarro along D. H. Peligro (whom he accidentally called H.R. Peligro) and Arik Marshall for the contributions they brought to the band. At 32, Klinghoffer was the youngest artist ever to be inducted into the hall of fame passing Stevie Wonder, who was 38 at the time of his induction. The band performed three songs, including [...] "By the Way", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Higher Ground", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in 24 years and Martinez in 26 years. Near the end of the ceremony, the band was joined by George Clinton, Michael Hampton, Slash, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tre Cool, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones for a performance of [...] "Higher Ground".|$|E
