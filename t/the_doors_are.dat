5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach the seating area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> {{extremely}} heavy, {{and when}} opening them great care {{had to be}} taken that the latch engaged the top of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> spring-loaded and if the springs <b>were</b> strong <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> would close immediately. On the inside, the driver and passenger both had door release pads located above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> openings. All one had to do to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> hit <b>the</b> pad and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> would slam shut.|$|R

5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E
25|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> four rows of open {{galleries}} with, on top, {{statues of}} Madonna with Child and, on the corners, the Four evangelists.|$|E

The announcement has been similar since 1974, when the first line of metro was opened. The announcements voiced on line B: Eva Jurinová, on line A: Světlana Lavičková and on line C: Tomáš Černý.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} eleven o'clock, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed behind them.|$|R
50|$|According {{to another}} legend, the azhwar saint Thirumangai Azhwar visited the temple and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> locked at <b>the</b> time. He was singing praise of Parimala Ranganathar, but <b>the</b> <b>door</b> still <b>was</b> not open. After {{continuous}} singing, he became frustrated {{at one point}} and so asked Parimala Ranganathar to keep the temple for himself, when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened.|$|R

25|$|Cave 15A is the {{smallest}} cave with a hall and one cell on each side. Its entrance is located just {{to the right of}} the elephant-decorated entrance to Cave 16. It is an ancient Hinayana cave with three cells opening around a minuscule central hall. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> decorated with a rail and arch pattern. It had an inscription in an ancient script, which has been lost.|$|E
25|$|There are no maps {{posted on}} the trains, but {{electronic}} screens in each carriage and recorded voice messages announce the stations as they come up. The station announcements and all signs are bilingual in English and French; a few features of the trains, such as the buttons touched to open <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>are</b> also marked in German {{as a result of}} their design heritage.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> {{unique in}} that they retract vertically, instead of {{traditional}} designs which swing outward or upward (the first car with retractable doors was the 1954 Kaiser Darrin, although these doors slid forwards not downwards). The body with its high sills, offers crash protection independent of the doors, {{and it is possible}} (although perhaps not legal in some countries) for the Z1 to be driven with the doors lowered.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were up}} at their {{accustomed}} hour and arrived at the works at Limehouse before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened. Presently some men and boys arrived, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened, and <b>the</b> two boys followed the others in.|$|R

5000|$|Yichud <b>is</b> {{alleviated}} when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This {{principle is}} known as pesach pasuach lireshus harabim (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open to <b>the</b> public domain, there is no concern of yichud." [...] This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> actually open 2. when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed but unlocked 3. then <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, {{but there is a}} reasonable possibility that people may knock on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as {{there is little or no}} chance that people would come in unexpectedly then.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> {{made up of}} {{a number}} of framed panels; unlike the Roman originals, however, the design at Hildesheim is not their design, but {{probably}} an imitation of the ancient Roman examples. Moreover, the impact of the frames is significantly reduced in favour of the figural scenes by their narrowness and the flat relief, so that they appear like the images of a contemporary illustrated manuscript, like the Codex Aureus of Echternach.|$|E
25|$|On systems {{where the}} floor {{level of the}} vehicle and the {{platform}} height closely match, an extendible step can be installed below {{the doors of the}} vehicle that deploy when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> unlocked. This significantly decreases the gap and thus the risks, while at the most vulnerable situation, boarding and alighting of vehicles at stations or stops. This method is used by the German BR423 EMU's and its derivatives, including the Dutch variant SLT.|$|E
25|$|The South Station head {{house and}} wings {{incorporate}} Neoclassical architecture. The building's symmetry and stone façade {{are common to}} the style. The granite came from nearby quarries in New England. The main doorways are located in a section that protrudes from the curving shape of the building. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> housed under tall arches that {{give the impression of}} grandeur while also making the building appear smaller from far away. This visual trick is common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} entry and exit actions {{is that they}} provide means for {{guaranteed}} initialization and cleanup, very much like class constructors and destructors in Object-oriented programming. For example, consider the [...] "door_open" [...] state from Figure 5, which corresponds to the toaster oven behavior while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This state has a very important safety-critical requirement: Always disable the heater when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. Additionally, while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open, <b>the</b> internal lamp illuminating the oven should light up.|$|R

25|$|Improved cargo {{security}} {{is also an}} important benefit of containerization. The cargo is not visible to the casual viewer and thus is less likely to be stolen; the doors of the containers are usually sealed so that tampering is more evident. Some containers are fitted with electronic monitoring devices and can be remotely monitored for changes in air pressure, which happens when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> opened. This reduced the thefts that had long plagued the shipping industry. Recent developments have focused on the use of intelligent logistics optimization to further enhance security.|$|E
25|$|UMass Amherst {{implements}} {{a multitude}} of services to ensure safety on and off campus for all students. On campus residence halls are constantly monitored and secured every night of the week. There are cadets stationed at the entrances that monitor the area while students are signed into the building. Anyone who does not live in that specific building has to be signed in by a friend with legitimate identification {{to ensure the safety}} of everyone in that residence hall. In addition, there are about 350 security cameras constantly monitoring every residence hall and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> always locked. The only way to enter is with a student ID registered to that specific building.|$|E
25|$|The western room (called {{the parlor}} or the dining room) was a public, ornately {{decorated}} room. The walls are painted a yellow ocher, and the woodwork is Chinese-style. The {{wall of the}} fireplace has a mantel decorated with fretwork, pagoda-like scalloped moldings, as well as canopies topped by pine cone finials. Above <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> similar canopies, which might have displayed Chinese porcelain vases or ceramic figures. The two long windows are topped by scalloped pediments, decorated with fretwork. During Mason's lifetime, three of the walls were probably wallpapered. During the 18th century, chinoese (Chinese-style) design was popular in Great Britain, however the Gunston Hall museum does not know of any other rooms in colonial America {{with this type of}} coordinated chinoiserie woodwork.|$|E

25|$|These train {{cars are}} fitted with green-blue tinted Glastroch (Germany) windows glass, and are almost {{identical}} to the first generation train cars before its refurbishment, except that its traction produces a louder, lower-pitched noise when accelerating/braking. The run number display {{on the front of}} each train is made up of electronic green flip-dot display, as opposed to the manual plastic rollers of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, while the rubber strips between <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> thicker. The trains have a full white body and a thick red stripe in the middle. Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have a built-in audio announcement system until the STARIS was installed and activated around 2010.|$|E
25|$|With the {{reluctant}} {{aid of the}} Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and proceeds to attack their families and burn their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned {{to live in a}} Gullah settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's brigade rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. However, after the location is given <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> barricaded, trapping the people as Tavington orders the church burned, killing them all in a cold-blooded act of genocide. After discovering the tragedy, Gabriel and several others race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing fight, Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon after, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.|$|E
25|$|Wood-carving {{examples}} of the first eleven centuries of AD are extremely rare. The carved panels of the main doors of St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> {{made up of a}} large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at Mount Athos in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit.|$|E
5000|$|A known {{issue with}} the camera <b>was</b> <b>the</b> battery {{compartment}} <b>door,</b> which <b>was</b> made from plastic. A somewhat cumbersome dual-action latching mechanism for <b>the</b> battery <b>door</b> often complicated this issue and, if operated incorrectly, could result in damage. Any damage to <b>the</b> battery <b>door</b> <b>was</b> troublesome, as <b>the</b> camera would not work at all if <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> unlatched. Fortunately, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> and is an inexpensive part and could be replaced simply.

5000|$|As <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> hung at <b>the</b> top {{from two}} points, it also needs a bottom track/stay roller {{to prevent it}} from {{swinging}} sideways.
