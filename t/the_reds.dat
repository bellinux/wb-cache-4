5|$|The 1926 NL pennant {{race was}} heated. During {{the second and}} third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> had multi-game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day. On September 17, the Cards took a one-game lead over <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> and {{extended}} their lead when <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> lost several games in a row. They lost the last game of the season to <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> on September 26, but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings.|$|E
5|$|The Superbas lodged a {{complaint}} against <b>the</b> <b>Reds,</b> claiming that Kelley was still under their control, seeking compensation from <b>the</b> <b>Reds.</b> However, the other NL owners saw the situation as a coup for their league, and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint. Kelley did not immediately report to Cincinnati, instead traveling to Boston to attempt to convince members of the Boston Americans {{to join him in}} the NL. Kelley joined <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> on July 31.|$|E
5|$|Though he was {{considered}} a top prospect, <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> held him out of winter league baseball during the 1995–96 offseason. <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> added Deion Sanders and Rubén Sierra to their outfield competition for the 1997 season, prompting Mottola to question <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> commitment to him. After he spent the 1997 season in the minors, <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> traded Mottola to the Texas Rangers for a player to be named later in April 1998. He {{spent most of the}} 1998 season with the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), but suffered a broken thumb that required surgery, limiting his season.|$|E

The Pirates won the NL East {{that year and}} faced <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> in the 1972 NLCS. The Pirates pitched Ellis with a sore arm, but <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> won the series.|$|E
5|$|Kelly, {{naturally}} a first baseman, saw regular time as {{a second}} baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base. With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade {{so that he could}} receive more playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush. <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> traded Roush due to a contract dispute. With Wally Pipp at first base for <b>the</b> <b>Reds,</b> Kelly was slated to play center field. <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to first base.|$|E
5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> allowed Nashville {{to use a}} {{designated}} hitter (DH) in their lineups. However, this allowance was later revoked, as <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> {{were a part of}} the National League which did not use a DH. Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> did not budge on their decision to prohibit the designated hitter, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.|$|E

The Boston Red Sox claimed him off waivers, and he spent 2010 {{in the minor leagues}} for them. He signed with the Doosan Bears of the Korea Baseball Organization in 2011, but he was released before appearing in a game with them.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> {{have won}} the World Series {{championship}} five times, in 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976 and 1990. Dutch Ruether was the Reds' Opening Day starting pitcher in 1919, Derringer in 1940, Don Gullett in 1975, Nolan in 1976 and Browning in 1990. <b>The</b> <b>Reds</b> won all five Opening Day games in seasons in which they won the World Series. In addition, prior {{to the existence of}} the modern World Series, <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> won the American Association championship in 1882. White was their Opening Day starting pitcher that season, the franchise's first. Jack Billingham started {{one of the most famous}} Opening Day games in Reds history on April 4, 1974 against the Atlanta Braves. In that game, Billingham surrendered Hank Aaron's 714th career home run, which tied Babe Ruth's all time home run record.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{spent most}} of 1952 with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, but he also pitched a few games for <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> during the 1952 Cincinnati Reds season. He pitched in two games for <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> in 1952, coming in to finish both games for <b>the</b> <b>Reds.</b> He pitched three shutout innings, {{allowing}} three hits in these two games. During his time with the Brewers, he pitched in 21 games. He started 19 of the 21 games, won ten and lost three, and had a 3.96 ERA. As the 1953 season began, Blake again had a stint with Cincinnati, but {{spent most of}} the season with the Indianapolis Indians. He pitched in one game for <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> on April 17, 1953 against the Milwaukee Brewers, allowing two earned runs on a hit and a walk without getting a batter out. During his time with the Indianapolis Indians, he pitched in 29 games, and was the workhorse of the Indians' squad. He finished the season with a 14–7 record, a 3.76 ERA, and 208 innings pitched, and led the team in wins, innings pitched, and starting appearances.|$|E
5|$|His initial {{appearance}} of the 1914season was in relief on April 17, {{a game in which}} he pitched 4innings, and gave up three runs in 6–5victory over <b>the</b> <b>Reds.</b> He followed that with two consecutive strong games as the starting pitcher, allowing just one unearned run in each game; the second was a complete game against <b>the</b> <b>Reds.</b> On June12, he started the game against New York, only to be injured in the third inning when he was hit in the hand by a ball batted by Fred Merkel, and had to leave the game. The injury did not cause Lavender to lose much playing time. He pitched a four-inning relief appearance on June19, followed by a complete game shutout on June27 against <b>the</b> <b>Reds.</b> On August17, he pitched a second shutout during the season, a 3-0victory over the Brooklyn Robins.|$|E

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of <b>the</b> <b>red</b> wolf has been debated since before efforts began in 1973 {{to save it}} from extinction.

Many studies throughout the 1970s focused on the morphology of <b>the</b> <b>red</b> wolf {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>the</b> <b>red</b> wolf is a distinct species. In 1980, a unique allele was found in Canis specimens from within <b>the</b> <b>red</b> wolf range, supporting the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>red</b> wolf is a distinct species. Nevertheless, some in the scientific community considered it a subspecies of the gray wolf or a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote.|$|R

March saw low counts because <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> could never seize new areas outside Red Finland. The numbers rose again in April as <b>the</b> <b>Reds</b> aimed to leave Finland. The two major terror centres were Toijala and Kouvola; 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{widespread}} use of St Patrick's Saltire today is in the Flag of the United Kingdom. With the 1800 Act of Union that merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, <b>the</b> <b>red</b> saltire was incorporated into the Flag of the United Kingdom as representing Ireland.The red saltire is counterchanged with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the white always follows <b>the</b> <b>red</b> clockwise. <b>The</b> arrangement accounts for the discontinuous look of <b>the</b> <b>red</b> diagonal lines, and has introduced a requirement to display the flag [...] "the right way up", with the white line of St Andrew above <b>the</b> <b>red</b> of St Patrick in the upper lefthand quarter next to the flagpole. As with <b>the</b> <b>red</b> cross, so too <b>the</b> <b>red</b> saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field. This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than <b>the</b> <b>red</b> portion. <b>The</b> fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its <b>red</b> from <b>the</b> <b>red</b> of <b>the</b> saltire.|$|R
