5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E

25|$|Miller became {{increasingly}} defensive as well. He added security at union headquarters, {{and demanded that}} all staff travel plans be cleared through him so he could detect plotting.

25|$|In the mayor's office, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Henry {{to stay in}} {{her office}} and to not let anyone in or out. She seals <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> office and runs into Robin (Sean Maguire), who pleads he is not afraid of her and wants to stay by her side. She replies {{that no one will}} be safe when this curse hits, then runs to her vault and seals herself in.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} Allan used her privileged {{position}} {{to improve the}} levels of comfort for her inmates, including distributing confectionery and fruit to fellow suffragettes. Two months into her sentence, she barricaded <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cell, and it reportedly took three men with tools around three quarters of an hour {{to break into the}} room. Following this action, Allan started a hunger strike, a form of protest that had been pioneered amongst the suffragette movement by Marion Dunlop in 1909. However, following Dunlop having thus successfully forced the authorities to release her on health grounds, the British government introduced a policy of forced-feeding of imprisoned suffragette activists who refused food.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> house on West Parkside Avenue, she found herself confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door and looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E

25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return when he felt he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, and went through the ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he was about to get an oath from her, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bedroom opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery. She went to live in the tower and the two windows became known as the Port of Treason and the Port of Light.|$|E
500|$|Accepting Aradia as {{the source}} of this practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini {{translation}} of these lines, which read [...] "Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead." [...] Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause [...] "in your rites". There are, however, earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches. Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be [...] "naked with their hair loose around their shoulders" [...] while reciting conjurations. Jeffrey Burton Russell notes that [...] "A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375: she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken off her clothes and stood above the dish in the nude, making magical signs". Historian Franco Mormando refers to an Italian witch: [...] "Lo and behold: in the first hours of sleep, this woman opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone, and she begins to do and say her various signs and conjurations ...".|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} also {{shares her}} given name with Fey, whose full name is Elizabeth Stamatina Fey. However, Liz Lemon is only very rarely {{referred to as}} [...] "Elizabeth" [...] and the character's name is usually given as [...] "Liz Lemon" [...] in official contexts (example, the plaque on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> office). It is also worth noting that in Fey's original script for 30 Rock, Lemon's first name was [...] "Lisa". The character's middle name, [...] "Miervaldis," [...] is a Latvian masculine name. Fey has said that, while Lemon's ethnic background is unknown, [...] "Latvian seems to make sense.". She has also, more recently, been suggested to have German ancestry, and speaks {{at least a little}} of the language. The character's last name, [...] "Lemon," [...] is apparently intended to imply an acerbic personality and possibly also to make her full name alliterative. Fey has stated that she wanted Liz to have a good last name since she knew the character would often be called by it.|$|E
60|$|The {{ride was}} short and Mrs. Throop, a tall, dark, rather gloomy woman, came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>her</b> guests with the air of an old-fashioned village hostess, serious but kindly.|$|R

50|$|Past {{activities}} of the Purple Shadows have included anonymous political statements. In the 1970-1971 term, the society gave an ambiguous welcome to Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Annette Gibbs, whose responsibilities included the advising female undergraduate students at the newly coeducational university, by tying <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> office shut with a purple ribbon. In 1982, following the decision of Dean of Students Robert Canevari to ban the traditional Easters celebration, the group left a letter and a dagger expressing their displeasure. The Dean filed charges against the group with the University Judiciary Committee, which were never answered.|$|R
2500|$|After her arrest, she {{was held}} at an annex to the Old Capitol Prison before being {{transferred}} to the Washington Arsenal on April 30. Two armed guards stood before <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cell {{from the beginning of}} her imprisonment until her death. Her cell, while airy and larger than the others, was sparsely furnished, with a straw mattress, table, wash basin, chair, and a bucket. Food was served four times a day, always of bread; salt pork, beef, or beef soup; and coffee or water. The other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded canvas bag to prevent a suicide attempt. Sources disagree as to whether Surratt was forced to wear it as well. Although the others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles, she was not manacled. (Rumors to the contrary were raised by reporters at the trial who could not see her or [...] "heard" [...] the clank of chains about her feet. The rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied.) She began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention. She was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter, Anna. She and Powell received the most attention from the press. The Northern press was also highly critical of her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Emil Nava and was premiered on 30 January 2011. The video begins closing up on a giant teddy bear that is missing an eye and an arm, accompanied by a musical box-rendering of Johann Strauss II's The Blue Danube, before zooming out to show a child version of Jessie J sitting next to it, who then {{gets up and walks}} around the bear, turning her into her full-sized self. Jessie J is then shown standing and holding out her hands, and as the lyrics suggest, a coconut man and a moonhead appear on her outstretched hands (this is a reference to the two individuals who co-wrote the song with her: Dr. Luke is coconut man and Kelly is moonhead in reference to his large head) and pointing to herself (referring to herself as pea because of her small head). The video then goes back to Jessie J in the lap of the large teddy bear and shows various scenes of Jessie J holding up items that relate to the lyrics, including a huge price tag and pointing to left and the right. As the chorus begins, Jessie J is shown dancing under a money tree with dollar bills covering its branches. A scene of Jessie J is then shown of her as an oversized ballerina in a jewelry box. As Jessie J says the words [...] "video hoes", a scene of her wearing the same outfit as in her [...] "Do It Like a Dude" [...] video and dancing holding her crotch, suggesting that she does not approve of video hoes. Jessie J is next shown riding around on a small tricycle. As the song progresses into the second chorus, Jessie J and two background dancers are shown as marionettes, with Jessie J wearing a Pinocchio hat, dancing to the song. The video then moves to B.o.B as his verse begins, showing him dancing in front of a beat up car, that starts jumping and moving to the beat. He is then shown {{standing in the middle of}} four large, toy green army men. As his verse ends, Jessie J is shown squeezed into a doll house and holding a glass doll that is missing part of its head. As the video goes into its final chorus, scenes of Jessie J are shown her dancing with B.o.B, laying on the floor missing a leg, sitting in an oversized chair, dressed up as a doll in a blue and white dress, and dancing with her younger self. The video ends with Jessie J closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> doll house; with her still inside it, the camera carries on zooming out.|$|E
