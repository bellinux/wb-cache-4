5|$|On July 23, 1911, Earp {{was arrested}} in Los Angeles and charged with {{attempting}} to fleece J. Y. Peterson, a realty broker, in a fake faro game. Since money had not changed hands, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Earp was reduced to vagrancy and he was released on $500 bail.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{prosecutors}} {{opened an}} investigation into charges of corruption dating to Pérez Balladares' time in office. He was placed under house arrest the following year, making him the first former Panamanian president to be arrested, and in October 2010 was charged with money laundering. A judge dismissed <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> him in April 2011. In February 2012, Pérez Balladares was convicted of slandering comptroller Alvin Weeden by calling him a narcocriminal, and sentenced to a $3,000 fine or a year in prison.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|General Sun led <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Cao Qin {{right outside}} Donghua Gate, while Ma Ang {{approached}} Cao Qin's {{forces from the}} rear in a flank. Cao was forced to withdraw and set up temporary camp at Dongan Gate. By midday, Sun Tang's forces had killed two of Cao Qin's brothers (Sun personally shot the second with an arrow after Cao Qin's brother led cavalry charges against imperial troops). Sun's forces had also severely wounded Cao Qin in both his arms; his forces took up position in the Great Eastern Market and Lantern Market northeast of Dongan Gate, while Sun deployed artillery units against the rebels. Cao lost his third brother, Cao Duo (曹铎), while attempting to flee out of Beijing by the Chaoyang Gate. Cao made another dash for the northeastern gates of the capital (Anding Gate and Dongzhi Gate), {{and then back to}} Chaoyang Gate, all of which remained closed. Finally, Cao fled with his remaining forces to fortify his residential compound in Beijing. Ming troops under Sun Tang and the newly arrived Marquis of Huichang, Sun Jizong (孙继宗), stormed the residence. To avoid arrest and execution, Cao Qin committed suicide by throwing himself down a well. Imperial troops recovered his body and then decapitated it.|$|E

25|$|On April 8, 2009, the Iranian {{government}} charged Saberi with espionage, {{which she}} denied. She was subsequently {{convicted and sentenced}} to an eight-year prison term.

25|$|After his arrest, Jackson accused two CID Detective Constables, Norman Carlisle and Raymond Buchanan, {{of having}} {{physically}} assaulted him on 7 August 1975 {{while he had}} been in police custody at Bessbrook RUC Station. Although medical evidence presented at the trial of the accused Detective Constables raised the possibility that Jackson's injuries were self-inflicted, on 23 December 1975 a magistrate upheld <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the two CID men and they were fined £10 each.|$|E

No formal pleas were taken from the other four defendants. All five were bailed to appear at the Crown Court on 6 September. Duckenfield was not required to appear as the Crown Prosecution Service has to apply to the High Court to lift a court order before he can be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges.|$|E
25|$|Virginia {{election}} {{authorities were}} ordered {{by a federal}} judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad.|$|E
25|$|The attempt of the Gitlow {{defense to}} declare the {{publication}} of the Left Wing Manifesto an expression of historical analysis rather than an act of practical advocacy was unsuccessful, however. Gitlow was convicted of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> him and on February 11, 1920, was sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. He served over two years at Sing Sing prison before being released on bail related to his filing of a writ of error. Gitlow's appeal motion was ultimately granted on December 13, 1922, followed by further hearings by the state.|$|E

25|$|When {{news of the}} atrocity reached Arundell's {{forces a}} new attack took place early on 6 August. Lord Grey was later to comment {{that he had never}} seen the like, nor taken part in such a murderous fray. As he had led <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> the Scots in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, this was a telling statement. Some 2000 died at the battle of Clyst Heath. A group of Devon men went north up the valley of the Exe, where they were {{overtaken}} by Sir Gawen Carew, who left the corpses of their leaders hanging on gibbets from Dunster to Bath.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the match, it was {{reported}} that India had complained against Anderson of physical abuse against Ravindra Jadeja at lunch on day 2, which led to level 3 charges being brought against Anderson and level 2 against Jadeja. The hearing was to be held on 22 July after {{the end of the}} 2nd Test. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> Jadeja was later reduced to level 1 and he was fined 50 percent of his match fee. The BCCI appealed against the fine and after a six-hour hearing over video conference, both players were found not guilty.|$|E
25|$|Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not {{actually}} repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges of the leaderships {{of the national}} republics and territories. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>against</b> non-Russians {{was that they had}} instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment of the Soviet Union and the restoration of capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National leaderships of the republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.|$|E
