40|$|To clarify <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> {{effects on}} <b>the</b> {{stability}} of crowns, {{some changes in}} the stability of crowns after thinning were simulated in sixteen sorts of <b>thinning</b> plans by <b>the</b> canopy dynamic model. Both the height and the eccentricity of the center of gravity of a tree 2 ̆ 7 s foliage were used as indexes of the stability of a crown. The results of simulation were summarized as in the following : 1. <b>The</b> <b>thinning</b> intensity largely effected the stability of crowns. The risings of center of gravity accompanying with the tree-height-growth were reduced in accordance with an increasing in <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> ratio. This result suggests the possibility of keeping the vertical stability of crowns by the execution of intensive <b>thinning.</b> <b>The</b> relative frequency of occurrence of the trees supplied with changing eccentricity during 5 years after <b>the</b> <b>thinning,</b> increased linearly with <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> ratio. 2. <b>The</b> upper and <b>the</b> all storied <b>thinning</b> reduced eccentricity more significantly than other <b>thinning</b> systems did. <b>The</b> cutting of the trees which were large enough to suppress the others was deemed to be effective to keep the horizontal stability of crowns. 3. <b>The</b> line <b>thinning</b> showed less effects on the individual foliage weight than other thinning systems did. Consequently, the planning of <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> ratio by using the stand density control diagram was deemed to be inadaptable to <b>the</b> line <b>thinning</b> system. 4. <b>The</b> line <b>thinning</b> enlarged <b>the</b> eccentricity more than other thinning systems did, showing the tendency to lose the horizontal stability of crowns. ...|$|R
30|$|In contrast, in the {{analysis}} of appreciation for the environment, the thin–thick indicator showed a trend: thinned (3.33) was evaluated as more deserted than unthinned (4.00). Moreover, because the physical changes due to <b>the</b> <b>thinning</b> and <b>the</b> appreciation corresponded, as a decrease in tree density and the total basal area of <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> condition was recognized, we suggest the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> forest strengthened <b>the</b> impression of the forest environment being deserted.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thin</b> {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E

5|$|Tree growth above those patches is curtailed by {{the alpine}} {{climate of the}} pass. It is {{characterized}} by severe changes in temperature, high winds and the deep winter snow. The resulting short growing season is made even shorter by <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> soil.|$|E
50|$|Thus, <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>the</b> oxide thickness, {{the lower}} the {{threshold}} voltage. Although this {{may seem to be}} an improvement, it is not without cost; because <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>the</b> oxide thickness, the higher the subthreshold leakage current through the device will be. Consequently, the design specification for 90-nm gate-oxide thickness was set at 1 nm to control the leakage current. This kind of tunneling, called Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling.|$|R

30|$|Because the {{solubility}} at <b>the</b> relatively <b>thinner</b> {{section is}} larger than that at thicker sections (the curvature perpendicular to the network axis is large at a <b>thin</b> section), <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> part dissolves and shrinks.

5|$|While A.bradleyi {{is easily}} outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, {{it is well}} adapted to <b>the</b> <b>thin,</b> acidic soil and harsh {{environment}} of its native cliffs, where it finds few competitors.

5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} a 12 -year-old {{plantation}} of Pinus radiata D. Don characterised seasonal changes in standing crops of fine (< l m m diam.) and small roots (1 - 2 mm diam.) in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> and control treatments. In the present study, standing crops of these roots were estimated from soil core samples {{for a second}} year {{to determine if the}} seasonal periodicity observed in the first year could be considered a general pattern. Results from Year 2 generally confirmed those from Year 1. With the exception of differences in late-winter/early-spring, standing crops of live fine roots indicated similar seasonal changes by treatment in the 2 years. Comparing the effect of treatment, we found no summer peak in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment for either year. The over-all standing crop of live fine roots in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment was 35 % of the control. The seasonal periodicity of dead fine roots in the control was similar for both years, but in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment, we found large differences by year. The over-all standing crop of dead fine roots was only 8 % lower in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment. Standing crops of small live roots did not change seasonally. The over-all standing crop of small live roots was lower in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment but increased from Year 1 to Year 2. This increase may indicate an expansion of the networking system to which fine roots are attached. No similar expansion, however, was detected for fine roots in <b>the</b> <b>thinned</b> treatment...|$|R

Fertilisation was applied at rates of 225, 450, 675, or 900  kg/ha with prilled urea (46 % nitrogen, Darling and Omule 1989).

5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E

To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism for using <b>the</b> <b>Thin</b> Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth.

Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of}} the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
