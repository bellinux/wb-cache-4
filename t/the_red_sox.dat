5|$|On {{the same}} day <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won Game 3, The Boston Globes Dan Shaughnessy wrote that, as this win brought <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{on the verge of}} winning a World Series, he {{wondered}} how many people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and hoping that one day, they would see <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> win a World Series.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> won the {{division}} by two games, forcing the Yankees into the Wild Card. This {{marked the first}} time both <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> and Yankees made the playoffs since 2009.

5|$|The Yankees and <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{finished}} {{tied for}} first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker {{game for the}} division title. The first-place tie came after <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> comeback {{was the only time}} in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> {{went on to win the}} World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.|$|E

Torrez started the game for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox.</b> He started for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> on Opening Day and had a 16–12 record, but contributed to <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> struggles late in the season with six consecutive losses.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930 season, Bob Quinn, {{the owner}} of <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> was in debt and afraid he would lose the team due to foreclosure. To raise capital, he traded Ruffing to the New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst, $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and a $50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees' owner.

5|$|In 1916, Harry Frazee {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's {{success with}} <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox,</b> owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who {{had threatened to}} hold out {{in lieu of a}} larger contract and become a distraction. After <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919. This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Sox</b> while the Yankees began their dynasty.|$|E
