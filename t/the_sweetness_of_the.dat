5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine.|$|E

25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E
25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending {{on the level of}} sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.|$|E

50|$|Due to Guangdong Province's {{location}} on <b>the</b> southern coast <b>of</b> China, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines {{from other parts}} of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of soy sauce, ginger and spring onion is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out <b>the</b> natural <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seafood.

500|$|Bach {{had taken}} up his tenure as Thomaskantor in Leipzig in 1723. During his first year there he {{composed}} a first cantata cycle for almost all occasions of the liturgical year. The second year he composed a cycle of mostly chorale cantatas, based on Lutheran hymns. The third year, Bach began a third cycle but wrote the works more irregularly. [...] was from a later incomplete cycle, which the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff calls the Picander cycle, after the librettist Picander with whom Bach had collaborated already for the St Matthew Passion, and worked together for several years.

This time, he's willing {{to go all the}} way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." [...] Leitch, however, said <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's [...] "Shoe-La-La" [...] shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a [...] "Horse Boat" [...] invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.|$|E

500|$|Rinuccini {{extended}} the libretto during the rehearsals, after complaints from the duchess that {{the piece was}} [...] "too dry"; {{as a result the}} early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven, were added. Preparations for the opera's performance were disrupted when, in March 1608, the leading soprano Caterina Martinelli died of smallpox. A replacement had to be found rapidly, and the title role fell to Virginia Andreidi, a renowned actress-singer who used the stage name [...] "La Florinda"; she reportedly learned the part in only six days. In his analysis of Monteverdi's theatrical works, Carter suggests that the lament may {{have been added to the}} work to make the most of Andreini's acting and vocal abilities. The premiere, on 28 May 1608, was staged in a specially erected temporary theatre, which according to contemporary reports could hold an audience of several thousands. The production was lavish; apparently 300 men were required to manipulate the stage machinery. Federico Follino, who prepared the Mantuan court's official report on the occasion, praised the beauty of the work, the magnificence of costumes and machinery, and <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music. Monteverdi's fellow-composer Marco da Gagliano was equally complimentary, writing that the opera had [...] "visibly moved the entire audience to tears." [...] It is possible that L'Arianna was performed in Florence in 1614; a projected performance in Mantua in May 1620 to celebrate Duchess Caterina's birthday was cancelled for unknown reasons. Otherwise, there are no records of the opera's performance before its revival in 1640 at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice. In his study of late Renaissance opera, Gary Tomlinson surmises that the work's enthusiastic reception in Venice was a significant factor in Monteverdi's decision to resume opera composition during his final years.|$|E

40|$|Variations of tastant {{concentration}} during <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> {{food products}} {{were shown to}} enhance taste intensity. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate the relation between the frequency at which tastant concentration is varied during <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> products and <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> taste enhancement. For this purpose, <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> intensity <b>of</b> sequences of 4 successive sweet stimuli represented by cubes of a semi-solid gel or spoons of a model custard dessert was assessed. The intensity and <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimuli within the sequences were varied to obtain 4 types of sucrose concentration profile (decreasing, increasing, middle peak and boundary peak) at 2 magnitudes of concentration differences (small and large). Sequences of 4 stimuli containing a constant sucrose concentration were used as a reference. <b>The</b> <b>sweetness</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences <b>of</b> successive stimuli was assessed using line scale and time-intensity ratings. Line scale ratings showed that <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> sequence had an effect on sweetness intensity. A sweetness enhancement relative to the reference was observed in sequences that ended with high-intensity stimuli, whereas sweetness suppression was observed in sequences that ended with low-intensity stimuli. <b>The</b> observed <b>sweetness</b> enhancement and suppression were attributed to serial position effects (i. e. recency effects). Time-intensity ratings indicated that each stimulus in the sequences was evaluated individually by the assessors.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> overall <b>sweetness</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different sequences was not enhanced in relation to the reference. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> taste enhancement in sequences exhibiting variations of sucrose concentration was attributed mainly to the long period at which sucrose concentration was varied during <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences.

2500|$|Since over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> {{ripening}} sugars in {{the grapes}} increase, <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> level {{as well as}} the potential alcohol level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine will play a considerable role in dictating when a grape is [...] "ripe" [...] enough.
