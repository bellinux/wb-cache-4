5|$|Many {{surviving}} funerary busts reached Western museums {{during the}} 19th century. Palmyra provided <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy {{at the turn}} of the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on Roman art replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by Josef Strzygowski and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the Western Roman Empire, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.|$|E
50|$|When {{traveling}} by automobile, <b>the</b> two <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> Highway 26 exits {{for access to}} the ballpark are the Cornelius Pass Road exit and the Helvetia/Brookwood exit.

40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{external}} views system (EVS) for a database management system (DBMS) was introduced a long time ago. The idea is to allow a user to perceive data in <b>the</b> form <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> for him. Thus the user can focus on those data and those relationships that are of some interest, ignoring all others...|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} his death has been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|SvalRak is the world's northern-most {{rocket launch}} site, and {{is located at}} the 79th {{parallel}} north. This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup. It is also used for studying the Magnetopause and aurora borealis, for which Ny-Ålesund is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> location because of its ease of access. It is owned by Andøya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has no permanent staff in Ny-Ålesund. The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|Taylor and Westmoreland {{began to}} lobby Kỳ and Thi, {{the two most}} {{powerful}} generals in the junta outside Khánh, hoping to enlist them {{in an effort to}} shut down Phát and Thảo while also removing Khánh. Kỳ was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> outlet, as the air force along with both the American and South Vietnamese military headquarters were adjacent to one another at Tan Son Nhut, making communication easy, whereas Thi was commanding I Corps in the far north. Westmoreland communicated with Kỳ through the latter’s adviser, Robert R. Rowland. Despite his inconvenient geographical location, Thi was seen as being hostile to Khánh by this point in time, and as a supporter of and commander of a region which was seen as the Buddhist heartland of Vietnam, he and his grassroots support base were strongly opposed to the Diemist pro-Catholic ideology espoused by Phát and Thảo.|$|E
30|$|According to (Wohlin et al. 2012), the {{selection}} of subjects is also called a sample from a population. In our experiment, we performed convenience sampling: <b>the</b> nearest and <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> persons are selected as subjects.|$|R

5|$|The {{extensions}} from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham {{were designed}} by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow {{the valley of the}} River Chess, which would have been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> route to Chesham, the route out of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont& Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3miles 56chains (3mi 1,232yd; 5,955m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down the slope of the Chess Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along the Chess Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of the Chess Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. Additional costs were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route.|$|E

25|$|In {{elementary}} algebra, the quadratic {{formula is}} {{the solution of the}} quadratic equation. There are other ways to solve the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as factoring, completing the square, or graphing.

30|$|For many forest {{inventory}} tasks, users {{may well be}} able to use whichever of <b>the</b> estimators is <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> to their purpose. However, model-assisted estimation has application in a wider range of circumstances than the other methods, which perhaps recommends it for general use.|$|R
25|$|Two {{systems for}} which these {{parameters}} coincide are called similar (as with similar triangles, they differ only in scale); they are equivalent {{for the purposes}} of the equation, and the experimentalist who wants to determine the form of the equation can choose <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> one. Most importantly, Buckingham's theorem describes the relation between the number of variables and fundamental dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Grasmere {{village is}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> {{starting}} point with approaches possible along either Far Easedale or Green Burn. The latter makes a direct assault up a grassy strip between Pike of Carrs and Rough Crag, while the Far Easedale route gains the ridge 'behind' the summit. Beginning {{from the head}} of Thirlmere a way can also be made up Wythburndale, although this will involve a certain amount of bog-hopping.|$|E
25|$|Enteral routes are {{generally}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> for the patient, as no punctures or sterile procedures are necessary. Enteral medications are therefore often preferred {{in the treatment}} of chronic disease. However, some drugs can not be used enterally because their absorption in the digestive tract is low or unpredictable. Transdermal administration is a comfortable alternative; there are, however, only a few drug preparations that are suitable for transdermal administration.|$|E

50|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, Dabul was an opulent Muslim trade centre, first {{under the}} Bahmani, later under the Adilshahi sultans of Bijapur.

They all formed the smallest element in the army's structure − the kopia, or Lances fournies.|$|E
25|$|The Yugoslav {{passport}} {{was issued}} to {{citizens of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia {{for the purpose of}} international travel.

25|$|Debriefing {{is another}} useful strategy. Healthcare {{providers}} meet {{to discuss a}} situation, record what they learned and discuss {{how it might be}} better handled. Closed loop communication is another important technique used to ensure that the message that was sent is received and interpreted by the receiver. SBAR is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>convenient</b> form possible. Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.|$|E
