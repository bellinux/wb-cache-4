5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> often {{as if it were}} perfect. For example, a crystal is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in nature are governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted {{to a specific}} habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Tactics Advance {{revolves}} around three primary characters: Marche Radiuju, {{the main character}} who battles the dream worlds of his friends; Ritz Malheur, a stubborn girl who speaks her mind and changes sides in her struggle for self-acceptance; and Mewt Randell, a boy whose mother died that discovers a magical entity that changes the world {{into the world of}} Ivalice. There are also secondary characters, such as Doned Radiuju, Marche's little brother who does not desire to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> since he is sick in the real world and healthy in the dream one; and Cid Randell, Mewt's father who becomes the Judgemaster of Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} modes {{that can be}} played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not {{accurate}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>World</b> Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors.|$|E
5|$|Though {{described}} {{often as}} a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{four of them}} {{travel to}} Murdaw's castle, in the {{original}} world. After defeating Murdaw, the Hero uses the Mirror on him. Murdaw then turns into the King of Somnia, confused and unaware of what happened. The king reveals that the original world {{is in fact the}} Dream World and the Phantom World is the Real World. Upon traveling back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>World,</b> the King of Somnia thanks the party for defeating Murdaw in his dreams, but that the real Murdaw lives and that the party must travel to Ghent to retrieve a boat to get to Murdaw's lair. In Ghent, Nevan, a healer, joins the party and allows them to use the Ghent Clan's ship. During the fight with the real Murdaw, the Hero gets is again sent back to Weaver's Peak. However, with the Mirror of Ra, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw.|$|E

5|$|Once Cloudsgate Citadel {{is back to}} normal, {{the party}} speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor's doings and how to reach the Dread Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds. The partyâ€™s horse fuses with Pegasus, {{allowing}} the party to fly to the Dread Realm. Several challenges await in the Dread Realm, with one such challenge being the party's strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor's Castle. After solving many puzzles, they {{come face to face}} with Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that the Dread Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape. After returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Real</b> <b>World,</b> everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self doesn't exist anymore. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle being the remaining visible portion in the Real World. It's then shown that Ashlynn is in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.|$|E
5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that the girl is still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} is {{intercepted by}} Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows {{herself to be}} captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon making eye contact with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b> In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.|$|E

Draper {{told them that they}} should not become preoccupied by the comments written by either the press or their viewers. In addition to prohibiting their boys from searching their names online, Draper and Wolff forbid them from auditioning. The boys are also enrolled in private school in New York City to keep them exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{painters}} {{were critical}} of ÅŒkyo's style. They {{found it to}} be overly concerned with physical appearances, alleging that he was too beholden <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> and produced undignified works. Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western-style landscapes, decorative screens, and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings. ÅŒkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{lines and}} large strokes of color, like words, are treated autonomouslyâ€”each {{possessing}} an abstract value independent of one another, yet together forming a coherent whole. The impulse toward abstraction becomes a primary quality of Metzinger's work of 1907. Though not without reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world,</b> Metzinger's {{treatment of the}} painted surface is meant to draw away from the outward appearance of nature. Imitation is vacated in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of idea, and represented {{the dominance of the}} artist over the mere stuff of nature.|$|E
