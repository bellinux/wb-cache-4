5|$|Many clubs provide {{training}} for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> but otherwise the student manages the controls until {{the student is}} deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo. Simulators are also beginning {{to be used in}} training, especially during poor weather.|$|E
5|$|McLeod fully transitioned to the Canadian senior {{national}} team following her {{performance at the}} U-19 World Championship. She has stated that the transition was difficult for her due to the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she often took <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to more experienced players, which affected her confidence.|$|E
5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a lamp post {{on the way to}} the hospital; Michael was delivered in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E

5|$|The present {{purpose is}} to {{illustrate}} the role of representation theory of groups in mathematics and in physics. Rigor and detail take <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> as the main objective is to fix the notion of finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group. The reader familiar with these concepts should skip by.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 {{he moved}} to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he worked with George Kistiakowsky on the {{development}} of explosive lenses required to detonate the implosion-type nuclear weapon. Morrison transported the core of the Trinity test device to the test site in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of a Dodge sedan. As leader of Project Alberta's pit crew he helped load the atomic bombs on board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war ended, he traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E
5|$|In February 1970, {{the album}} was {{released}} by RCA Records. The cover art was completed by Dean Torrence, known for his teaming with Jan Berry to create {{the rock and roll}} duo Jan and Dean. Since Berry's near-fatal auto accident in 1966, Torrence had become a graphic artist; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old American car through the countryside with Newman in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The car is a 1938 Graham-Paige four-door sedan, rusty but working.|$|E

After the war ended, Morrison and Robert Serber traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt {{personally}} visited Kentucky {{to campaign}} on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As {{governor of the}} state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had loaded <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of {{his truck}} with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought {{a new set of}} tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives. He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, {{as well as to the}} school, town, and his house. A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but never thought to mention it to anyone.|$|E

5|$|Tammi {{returns from}} the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the {{conclusion}} that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|The P2Vs {{would be}} first augmented, and then replaced, {{by the more}} capable North American AJ Savage as they became available.

5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> He immediately called the police.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
60|$|Even in {{the porch}} he hesitated. Since {{he had left}} he had never entered a church nor chapel. The sound of the organ came pealing out to him--others were passing in, in a little stream; soon he, too, found himself in one of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{its normal}} {{interior}} configuration (with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> up and <b>the</b> parcel shelf in place) the rear cargo area {{does have a}} noticeably small opening (52 cm by 82 cm) and an elevated lip necessitating the lifting of luggage quite high {{before it can be}} placed inside. However the boot (trunk) is relatively deep and spacious. In addition the rear seats fold down and both the parcel shelf and the rear divider panel (usually in place behind <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats)</b> can be completely removed, in essence turning the entire rear half of the car into a cargo area. As such the Toyota Sera has a large amount of available storage space for its size. The space-saving spare tire and changing kit are contained in a small compartment below the boot floor.|$|R
5|$|While on foot patrol, Police Constable Don Ross (Anthony Oliver) chances upon {{a gang of}} lorry hijackers {{operating}} {{from the back of}} a transport café. After seeing Diamond (George Murcell) and Johnny (David Graham) drive off in a car with the manageress, Connie Williams (Miriam Karlin), apparently being held hostage in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> Ross jumps onto and clings to the vehicle's side; however, he is quickly thrown into the road, suffering a head injury. Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of her car, and manages to bring her {{to the safety of}} his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E
5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E

5000|$|All {{crew members}} sit on forward-facing, {{upward-firing}} Douglas Escapac zero-zero ejection seats. In [...] "group eject" [...] mode, initiating ejection from either front seat ejects the entire crew in sequence, with <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> ejecting 0.5 {{seconds before the}} front {{in order to provide}} safe separation. The rear seats are capable of self ejection, and the ejection sequence includes a pyrotechnic charge that stows the rear keyboard trays out of the occupants' way immediately before ejection. Safe ejection requires the seats to be weighted in pairs, and when flying with a single crewman in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> unoccupied <b>seat</b> is fitted with ballast blocks.|$|R
