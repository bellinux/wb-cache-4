40|$|In this paper, a novel approach, Inforence, is {{proposed}} {{to isolate the}} suspicious codes that likely contain faults. Inforence employs a feature selection method, based on mutual information, to identify those bug-related statements that may cause the program to fail. Because the majority of a program faults may be revealed as undesired joint effect of the program statements on each other and on program <b>termination</b> <b>state,</b> unlike the state-of-the-art methods, Inforence tries to identify and select groups of interdependent statements which altogether may affect the program failure. The interdependence amongst the statements is measured according to their mutual effect on each other and on the program <b>termination</b> <b>state.</b> To provide the context of failure, the selected bug-related statements are chained to each other, considering the program static structure. Eventually, the resultant cause-effect chains are ranked according to their combined causal effect on program failure. To validate Inforence, {{the results of our}} experiments with seven sets of programs include Siemens suite, gzip, grep, sed, space, make and bash are presented. The experimental results are then compared with those provided by different fault localization techniques for the both single-fault and multi-fault programs.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a discrete time, ®nite state Markov reward process {{that depends on}} a set of parameters. We start with a brief review of (stochastic) gradient descent methods that tune the parameters in order to optimize the average reward, using a single (possibly simulated) sample path of the process of interest. The resulting algorithms can be implemented online, and have the property that the gradient of the average reward converges to zero with probability 1. On the other hand, the updates can have a high variance, resulting in slow convergence. We address this issue and propose two approaches to reduce the variance. These approaches rely on approximate gradient formulas, which introduce an additional bias into the update direction. We derive bounds for the resulting bias terms and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the resulting algorithms. For one of the approaches considered, the magnitude of the bias term exhibits an interesting dependence on the time it takes for the rewards to reach steady-state. We also apply the methodology to Markov reward processes with a reward-free <b>termination</b> <b>state,</b> and an expected total reward criterion.

40|$|We {{consider}} the stochastic shortest path problem, a classical finite-state Markovian decision {{problem with a}} <b>termination</b> <b>state,</b> and we propose new convergent Q-learning algorithms that combine elements of policy iteration and classical Q-learning/value iteration. These algorithms {{are related to the}} ones introduced by the authors for discounted problems in [BY 10 b]. The main difference from the standard policy iteration approach is in the policy evaluation phase: instead of solving a linear system of equations, our algorithm solves an optimal stopping problem inexactly with a finite number of value iterations. The main advantage over the standard Q-learning approach is lower overhead: most iterations do not require a minimization over all controls, in the spirit of modified policy iteration. We prove the convergence of asynchronous deterministic and stochastic lookup table implementations of our method for undiscounted, total cost stochastic shortest path problems. These implementations overcome some of the traditional convergence difficulties of asynchronous modified policy iteration, and provide policy iterationlike alternative Q-learning schemes with as reliable convergence as classical Q-learning. We also discuss methods that use basis function approximations of Q-factors and we give an associated error bound...|$|E

To better understand the material properties of the human placenta, a Finite Element (FE) model of human placenta tissue was created and verified using data from uniaxial tension tests. Sixty-four tensile tests at three different strain rates of 7 % strain/s, 70 % strain/s, and 700 % strain/s from six whole human placentas were used for model development. Nominal stresses were calculated by dividing forces at the grips by the original cross-sectional area. Nominal strains were calculated by dividing cross-head displacement by the original gauge length. A detailed methodology for interpreting experimental data for application to material model development is presented. A model of the tension coupon was created in LS-DYNA and stretched {{in the same manner as}} the uniaxial tension tests. The behavior of the material was optimized to the uniaxial tension test using a multi-island genetic algorithm.
