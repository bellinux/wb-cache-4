5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narrated event relative to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|After being {{launched}} in 1872, {{she served as}} a training vessel from 1875 in the South China Sea, making at least one journey to Japan.

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E
5|$|Bent {{completed}} {{a move to}} Tottenham Hotspur for a club record fee of £16.5million on 29 June 2007, {{which was to be}} payable over three years and is inclusive of add-on payments. Ipswich were entitled to 20% of Charlton's profit on Bent under a sell-on clause, which gave the club an initial £2.58million. He scored his first goal for Tottenham in a friendly match against Stevenage Borough in their first pre-season fixture of the 2007–08 season. Bent scored his first competitive goal for Tottenham in a 4–0 home victory over Derby County in August 2007. This was followed up by scoring in the 6–1 win over Anorthosis Famagusta {{in the first round of}} the UEFA Cup on 20 September 2007. Bent scored his 100th career goal on 9 March 2008 in the added <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 4–0 league win over West Ham. He also scored the 100th goal to be scored at White Hart Lane during 2007–08 on 22 March in a 2–0 win over Portsmouth. Bent went on to score one more goal that season, against Newcastle United, which he finished with 36 appearances and 8 goals.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and change over <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also {{closely related to}} human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E

5000|$|An {{algorithm}} {{operates on}} input, {{and the size}} of that input usually determines its running time. Big O notation is used to denote the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>an</b> algorithm's execution <b>time</b> based on the amount of input. For example, the running <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> O(n) algorithm increases linearly as the input size n grows. The running <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> O(nˆ2) algorithm grows quadratically. If it is possible to establish a constant upper bound on the running <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> algorithm, it is considered to be O(1) (one might say it runs in [...] "constant time"). That is, an O(1) algorithm is guaranteed to complete in <b>a</b> certain amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> regardless <b>of</b> the size of the input.|$|R
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued {{use of the word}} elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E

5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (also {{known as}} KAL007 and KE007) was a {{scheduled}} Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the South Korean airliner serving {{the flight was}} shot down by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but deviated from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives. The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15, and found the flight recorders in October, but this information was kept secret until 1993.|$|E
5|$|McBreen {{made his}} debut for the Mariners in 1–0 away win over Melbourne Heart on 5 August 2010, {{in which he}} was {{substituted}} for Nik Mrdja in the 90th minute.

McBreen was sent off {{for the first time since}} returning to Australia with a second yellow card during the stoppage <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 5–1 home defeat to Brisbane Roar on 28 November 2010, and returned from suspension as a 52nd-minute substitute for Adam Kwasnik in a 1–1 draw away to Perth Glory on 12 December 2010. With a second-placed finish in the 2010–11 A-League table the Mariners qualified for the finals series, and he started in their 4–2 aggregate defeat to Brisbane Roar in the major semi-final and their 1–0 win over Gold Coast United in the preliminary final. McBreen came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Simon in the 2011 A-League Grand Final at Lang Park on 13 March 2011, and after a 2–2 extra time draw he missed one of the penalty kicks as the Mariners lost the shoot-out 4–2. He made 31 appearances and scored five goals for the Mariners in 2010–11.|$|E
