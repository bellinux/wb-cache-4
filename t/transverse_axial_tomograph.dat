Nineteen patients from 18 to 45 years old (average age: 27. 4 years; 16 females and 3 males), with history of orofacial pain, but without clinical or radiological signs of disc displacement, underwent ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the examination of their joints. In 30 joints, the distance between the most lateral point of the articular capsule and the most lateral point of the mandibular condyle (lateral capsule-condyle distance) was measured, as well as the distance between the most anterior point of the articular capsule and the most anterior point of the mandibular condyle (anterior capsule-condyle distance). In the closed-mouth position, the average values found for the lateral capsule-condyle distance were 1. 4 mm and 1. 6 mm, respectively in the longitudinal (coronal) and <b>transverse</b> (<b>axial)</b> scans. In the open-mouth position, the average distance was 1. 2 mm, in both longitudinal (coronal) and <b>transverse</b> (<b>axial)</b> scans.

Intra-examiner agreement, measured in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient, varied from 0. 83 to 0. 93.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{normal and}} delayed bone healing by {{measuring}} ultrasound conduction velocity across the bone callus. METHODS: A model of transverse linear and 5 mm resection osteotomies of sheep tibiae was used. Fourteen sheep were operated on and {{were divided into}} two groups of seven according to osteotomy type. The procedure was performed on the right tibiae and the intact left tibiae were used as controls. The <b>transverse</b> and <b>axial</b> ultrasound velocities were measured at 30 -day intervals for 90 days, after which the animals were killed and both the right and left tibiae were resected for in vitro biomechanical analysis. RESULTS: Both the <b>transverse</b> and <b>axial</b> ultrasound velocities progressively increased, but the increase was smaller for the delayed union that resulted from the resection osteotomy. The mechanical resistance was higher for the normally healed tibiae that resulted from a linear osteotomy; this result closely correlated with the ultrasound velocity results. Significant differences were found for the comparisons between the intact and operated tibiae in both groups and between the groups for both the <b>transverse</b> and <b>axial</b> ultrasound velocities, but the differences were greater for the latter. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in vivo <b>transverse</b> and <b>axial</b> ultrasound velocities provide highly precise information about the healing state of both linear and resection diaphyseal osteotomies, but the axial ultrasound velocity most likely has greater discriminatory power. This method has the potential for clinical application in humans...|$|R

40|$|The {{combined}} {{use of the}} CAT (computed <b>axial</b> <b>tomograph)</b> {{and computer}} dosimetry allows better calculation of dose distribution in radiotherapy. Treatment plans can be calculated so rapidly that several may be drawn up until one with satisfactory dose distribution is achieved. In a first program, the dose distribution is given on a course matrix; owing to the rapidity of this conventional program and the possibilities of changing parameters, it renders it possible to seek the optimal solution for the treatment. A second, more exact program then puts into operation the solution found, and supplies documents that characterize the treatment plan, the irradiation protocol and the dose distribution, {{in the form of}} isodose curves. This combined method outlines the volumes to be treated, gives better insight into the arrangement of organs to be protected and allows evaluation of the variations of the absorption coefficients {{as a function of the}} density of the tissues through which the irradiation bundles pass. Accordingly, highly accurate treatment plans, optimally adjusted to the patient's condition may be drawn up.
