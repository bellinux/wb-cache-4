25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} for ITV, Niall Wass defended the firm's practices and challenged critics to [...] "go use the service, {{see if you}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> and transparent, take out £30 for ten days, pay it back after a week, look at the price, tell me if that is fair and transparent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{provided}} {{testimony to}} the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1964. Lane testified that he had contacted witness Helen Markham sometime within the five days preceding his appearance before the Commission {{and that she had}} described Tippit's killer to him as [...] "short, a little on the heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy". He added, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to state that an accurate description of Oswald would be average height, quite slender with thin and receding hair." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Humble {{commented that}} the most common {{criticism}} he received [...] "was that they felt my explanations were unduly detailed. I stand by the decision to include the explanation however as I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> helped some folks understand my intent and I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> just to leave them without explanation." ...|$|R
5000|$|After a day {{of protests}} from Yes campaigners, and demands that Robinson should be sacked, the {{following}} Monday (15 September), Salmond responded to questions from journalists at Edinburgh Airport. About Robinson's report in later bulletins, he said: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> for Nick to suggest that I hadn't answered a question when I actually answered it twice." [...] He did not believe Robinson should be sacked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Allan is {{perfectly}} lovely," [...] she announced one Sunday afternoon. [...] "She's taken our class and she's a splendid teacher. She said right away she didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> {{for the teacher}} to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many. I'm good at asking questions, Marilla." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "If the Russian fans boo {{their players}} in Moscow like {{you people are}} booing us, I'll come back and {{apologize}} personally to every one of you, but I really don't think that will happen. We gave it and are doing our best. All of us guys are really disheartened[...] [...] We came out here because we love Canada. They're a good hockey team, and we don't know {{what we could do}} better, but I promise we will figure it out. But it's totally ridiculous – I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> that we should be booed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My aunt {{does not}} like my staying; I can see that; and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to do so while {{she does not know}} all about it. It is {{something}} like cheating her out of the use of the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Professor Elmore wouldn't be so mean; {{and if he}} would, I shouldn't." [...] She was frightened, but {{she felt}} her spirit rising, too. [...] "You seem to know so well who I am: do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> for you to keep me in ignorance?" ...|$|E
60|$|BARTHWICK. [Exchanging glances {{with his}} wife.] By the way, Mrs. Jones--I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only <b>fair</b> to tell you, a silver cigarette-box --er--is missing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean, how {{you receive}} what I {{have told you}} of his views; I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> or kind {{to keep him in}} ignorance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was a {{great deal}} more disgusted than surprised," [...] she said rather indignantly. [...] "I did not <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> at all that I should step into Mark's shoes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am not unreasonable," [...] said Annie. [...] "You {{are trying}} to get Miss March away from my cousin; and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair,</b> and I don't want you to do it. When you were here before, I thought you two were good friends, but now I don't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A pretty deal," [...] said Norman; then added, [...] "One {{knows what}} to be at with the dead, better than with the living; they don't make parties against one. I don't wonder at it. It was very hard {{on some of those}} great fellows to have me set before them, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to visit it by putting up the little boys to all sorts of mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> {{to read it}} all,' said Phoebe, {{glancing over}} the tender passages. 'Poor child, how ashamed she will be! But listen--' and she read a portion, as if meant to {{restrain}} the girl's impatience, promising to offer a visit to Beauchamp, or, if that were refused till the captives were carried off, assuring her there would be ways and means at Acton Manor, where a little coldness from the baronet always secured the lady's good graces.|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be helped. I've {{got to help}} Dick. Father is too {{broken down}} to attend to business, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the <b>fair</b> thing {{to put it all}} off on Dick's shoulders." ...|$|R
5000|$|Interview {{structure}} {{is defined as}} [...] "the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview." [...] Structure in an interview {{can be compared to}} a typical paper and pencil test: we would not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.|$|R

6000|$|If, however, {{there be}} truly other people, {{with their own}} world under their feet, then I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> {{to say that we}} all have our {{infinite}} identity in the sun. That in the rush and swirl of death we pass through fiery ways to the same sun. And from the sun, can the spores of souls pass to the various worlds? And to the worlds of the cosmos seed across space, through the wild beams of the sun? Is there seed of Mars in my veins? And is astrology not altogether nonsense? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{too young}} to think of such a matter, madame," [...] Nat laughed. [...] "Why, I am only just nineteen, {{and it will be}} quite soon enough to think of that in another eight or ten years. But {{there is no doubt that}} when the time comes I shall give up the sea. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to a wife to leave her at home while you are running the risk of being shot. It is bad enough for her in time of peace, but in war-time it must be terrible for her, and it strikes me that this war is likely to be a long one. It seems to me that it is a {{question}} for a man to ask himself, whether he loves his profession or a woman better. If he cares more for the sea, he should remain single; if he thinks more of the woman, let him settle down with her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at present. Unfortunately I'm {{a little}} {{particular}} as to whom I drink with. Boys, don't you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>fairer</b> if you heard our guests first, and then paid {{for your own}} refreshment afterward if they didn't convince you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>fairer</b> to call <b>it</b> a tie, Bab, for <b>it</b> really <b>was,</b> and I {{want you}} to wear this. I wanted the fun of beating, but I don't care a bit for this girl's thing and I'd rather see it on you." ...|$|R

5000|$|Without in {{the least}} dismissing or belittling earlier writers and work, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to say that science fiction changed around 1960, and that the change tended toward an {{increase}} in the number of writers and readers, the breadth of subject, the depth of treatment, the sophistication of language and technique, and the political and literary consciousness of the writing. The sixties in science fiction were an exciting period for both established and new writers and readers. All the doors seemed to be opening.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2012, Marshall {{cancelled}} {{a scheduled}} appearance in Tel Aviv, Israel, citing [...] "much confusion" [...] {{and that she}} felt [...] "sick in her spirit." [...] She had faced calls to boycott the Jewish state over its conflict with Palestine. Two months later, she cancelled her appearance at the Coachella Music Festival, claiming that she [...] "didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fair</b> to play Coachella while my new album is not yet finished," [...] also hinting that her forthcoming record is [...] "almost done" [...] and will see release later in 2012.

Mrs. Aleshine and me has had to bow our heads to afflictions, and to walk {{sometimes}} in roads we didn't want to; but we've remembered the ways in which we was brought up, and have kept in them as far as we've been able. When our husbands died, leavin' Mrs. Aleshine with a son, and me without any, which, perhaps, is just as well, for there's no knowin' how he might have turned out--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Former Dublin footballer Ciarán Whelan {{writing in}} the Herald felt the current Dublin team is {{probably}} the best to pull on the jersey saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to day at this point that this team is probably the greatest team ever to put on the Dublin jersey and the sacrifices that they have made is finally being rewarded on the top stage. It is a truly remarkable achievement to win so many Leinster, All-Ireland and National league wins and we should savour every moment as these periods of success have been few and far between over the past thirty years." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 2 May 2006, Mukhtaran {{spoke at}} the United Nations {{headquarters}} in New York. In an interview with United Nations TV, Mai said that [...] "she {{wanted to get the}} message across to the world that one should fight for their rights and for the rights of the next generation." [...] She was welcomed by UN Under-Secretary General Shashi Tharoor, who said, “I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> to say that anyone who has the moral courage and internal strength to turn such a brutal attack into a weapon to defend others in a similar position, is a hero indeed, and is worthy of our deepest respect and admiration.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Klee himself tried LSD {{prior to}} the Army experiments. [...] "I felt obliged to take it for {{experimental}} reasons and also because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to administer a drug to someone else that I hadn't taken myself," [...] {{he said in his}} interview with the Evening Sun.|$|R

6000|$|Evan {{threw away}} his weapon, and, as his custom was, imprisoned his big {{head in his}} hands.
