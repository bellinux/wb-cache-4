50|$|Despite {{its small}} size, {{the system can}} deliver 8 000-10 000 newton metres of torque, so a {{separate}} planetary gear set is generally not required. Due to the large number (40) of piston movements per rotation, the torque is also smooth. If <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> all <b>withdrawn</b> into <b>the</b> hub, the rollers are not {{in contact with the}} cam ring, and the wheel can freewheel.|$|R
50|$|A fire piston {{consists}} of a hollow cylinder sealed {{at one end and}} open at the other. Sizes range in length from 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 cm) with a bore about 0.25 inch (6-7mm) in diameter, to 10 to 14 inches (25 to 35 cm) with a bore about 0.5 inch (14mm) in diameter. A piston with an airtight circular seal is fitted into the cylinder. String packing, rubber gaskets, or grease are used to create an air-tight but slippery seal. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> a small cavity, where tinder can be attached without it being crushed during subsequent operations. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> can <b>be</b> completely <b>withdrawn</b> from the cylinder for installation or removal of the tinder.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piston</b> (or {{cylinder}}) has {{a handle}} on the end to allow a firm grip to be applied to it, or a large enough surface area to strike it sharply without causing pain, while <b>the</b> cylinder (or <b>piston)</b> <b>is</b> braced or slammed against a hard surface. The compression of the air when <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> quickly forced into the cylinder causes the interior temperature to rise sharply to over 400 °F (260 °C), the autoignition temperature of tinder. This is hot enough for the tinder on or in <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> face to ignite with a visible flash that can be seen, if the cylinder is made of translucent or transparent material. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> then quickly <b>withdrawn,</b> before the now-burning tinder depletes the available oxygen inside the cylinder. The smouldering tinder can then be removed from the face of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and transferred to a larger nest of tinder material. The ember is then fanned or blown upon vigorously to create a flame, at which time various stages of larger kindling can be added until built into a full-scale fire.|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> to separate <b>the</b> pressure zones inside <b>the</b> barrel. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> machined with grooves to fit elastomeric or metal seals and bearing elements. These seals can be single acting or double acting. The difference in pressure {{between the two}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> causes <b>the</b> cylinder to extend and retract. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> attached with <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> rod by means of threads, bolts, or nuts to transfer the linear motion.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>piston</b> engine, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ratio {{between the}} volume of the {{cylinder}} and combustion chamber when <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of its stroke, and {{the volume of}} the combustion chamber when <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> top of its stroke.|$|R
50|$|Pistons: Introduced in Season 3, <b>the</b> <b>Pistons</b> <b>are</b> {{steel columns}} that {{raise and lower}} from the floor without warning. They can stop a {{charging}} robot or tip a slow moving robot onto its side. <b>The</b> <b>Pistons</b> <b>were</b> removed for Seasons 4 and 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{compression}} ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between {{the volume of}} the cylinder, when <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of its stroke, and the volume when <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> top of its stroke.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piston</b> {{starts in}} <b>the</b> inner dead center (IDC) with suction process. After a {{rotation}} angle of 180° it is finished and the workspace of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> filled with <b>the</b> moved medium. <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> now in <b>the</b> outer dead center (ODC). From {{this point on}} <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> displaces <b>the</b> previously sucked medium in the pressure channel of the pump.|$|R
50|$|Option Three - Shorter Cylinder:As {{viewed from}} below the wrist pin this option {{is the same}} as option one - the skirt length stays the same. However, since the height of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> changed,the {{distance}} from the wrist pin to the top of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> decreased.|$|R
40|$|A {{vibration}} free fluid compressor particularly {{adapted for}} Stirling cycle cryogenic refrigeration apparatus comprises {{a pair of}} identical opposing ferromagnetic pistons located in a housing and between a gas spring including a sealed volume of a working fluid such as gas under pressure. The gas compresses and expands in accordance with movement of <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> to generate a compression wave which can be vented to other apparatus, for example, a displacer unit in a Stirling cycle engine. <b>The</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> urged outwardly due to {{the pressure of the}} gas; however, a fixed electromagnetic coil assembly located in the housing adjacent <b>the</b> <b>pistons,</b> <b>is</b> periodically energized to produce a magnetic field which interlinks <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> in such a fashion that <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> mutually attracted to one another. The mass of <b>the</b> <b>pistons,</b> in conjunction with the compressed gas between them, form a naturally resonant system which, when <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> electromagnetically energized, produces an oscillating compression wave in the entrapped fluid medium...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> {{made from}} an {{aluminum}} alloy designed to withstand high temperatures. An indentation <b>is</b> incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> to prevent <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> from hitting <b>the</b> valves if the timing belt breaks. <b>Piston</b> pins holding <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> in place <b>are</b> locked by snap rings.|$|R
50|$|The REC7 uses a short-stroke gas piston {{designed}} by Barrett. It rides above the barrel and is housed inside the fore-end. <b>The</b> spring-loaded <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> a one-piece 17-4 stainless steel rod. The forward and rearward movement of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> approximately one inch.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> post-1957 <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> {{coated with}} copper {{on the inside}} and top. This was done to prevent the nitrile {{hardening}} process from hardening the ball socket joint area. The outside wall of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>was</b> then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a <b>piston.</b> <b>The</b> conical valve <b>is</b> part of this <b>piston.</b> <b>The</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> larger, <b>the</b> full diameter of <b>the</b> <b>piston,</b> and <b>is</b> supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the conical valve contains a small pilot valve, linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|R
50|$|The flow of {{air through}} the venturi creates a reduced static {{pressure}} in the venturi. This pressure drop is communicated to the upper side of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> via an air passage. The underside of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> open to atmospheric pressure. The difference in pressure {{between the two sides}} of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> lifts <b>the</b> <b>piston.</b> Opposing this <b>are</b> <b>the</b> weight of <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> and <b>the</b> force of a spring that <b>is</b> compressed by <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> rising. Because <b>the</b> spring is operating over a very small part of its possible range of extension, its force is approximately constant. Under steady state conditions the upwards and downwards forces on <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>are</b> equal and opposite, and <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> does not move.|$|R

50|$|Pressure is {{supplied}} to each cylinder {{at the point}} where <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> at a stage of upward travel, and an opening to exhaust <b>is</b> provided where <b>the</b> <b>pistons</b> <b>are</b> at their descent. The rotation of the cylinders provides the valving effect necessary for operation; the pressure feeds and exhaust remain stationary. This compounded with the fact that each shaft features two pistons results in a low number of moving parts.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the other}} plan," [...] said Forester, [...] "the steam under <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> condensed, that is, turned {{suddenly}} into water; and this leaves a vacancy or void below <b>the</b> <b>piston,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> can <b>be</b> forced down {{much more easily}} than if it had to drive the steam out before it, against {{the pressure of the}} atmosphere." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{valuable}} {{to calculate the}} work done in a process. The work done in a process is the area beneath the process path on a P-V diagram. Figure 2 If the process is isobaric, then the work done on <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> easily calculated. For example, if the gas expands slowly against <b>the</b> <b>piston,</b> <b>the</b> work done by the gas to raise <b>the</b> <b>piston</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> force F times the distance d.
