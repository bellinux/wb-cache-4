5|$|A furious Holiday Inn {{management}} {{presented the}} groups {{with a bill}} for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life {{from all of the}} hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
5|$|At Washington-on-the-Brazos, {{the delegates}} to the {{convention}} learned of the Alamo's fall on March 13. The Republic's new ad interim government was sworn in on March 17, with a department overseeing military spy operations, and adjourned the same day. The government then fled to Groce's Landing where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> for several days {{before moving on to}} Harrisburg on March 21 where they established temporary headquarters in the home of widow Jane Birdsall Harris.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the park}} was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was {{converted}} to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added fields for polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground, where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.|$|E

He was told he would be travelling with Bandi Grosz (real name, Andor Gross), a Hungarian {{who had worked for}} Hungarian and German military intelligence; Grosz would travel to Istanbul as the director of a Hungarian transport company. The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May, where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> the night in a hotel reserved for the SS.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand {{had been}} {{involved}} in affairs after marrying Imelda Marcos. Ferdinand's most public affair was with American actress Dovie Beams in 1966. While staying in one of the President's safe houses, she recorded her affair with the President. These tapes were later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda. <b>They</b> <b>stayed</b> married through a deal; Imelda had free rein on her projects in exchange for delivering votes for Ferdinand in the second election.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of their history, Bristol Rovers have played their home games at the Eastville Stadium, where they remained for a period of 89 years from 1897–1986. Financial problems led to the team being forced to leave Eastville, and they found a temporary home at Twerton Park, the home of Bath City. <b>They</b> <b>stayed</b> in Bath for 10 seasons, before returning to Bristol in 1996.|$|E

Large crowds had {{gathered}} to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} LDS Church apostles, Kimball {{traveled}} extensively {{to fulfill a}} wide variety of administrative and ecclesiastical duties. Early in his time as an apostle, Kimball was directed by church president George Albert Smith to spend extra time in religious and humanitarian work with Native Americans, which Kimball did throughout his life. He initiated the Indian Placement Program, which helped many Native American students gain education in the 1960s and 1970s while <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> with LDS foster families.|$|E

However it is {{currently}} considered that they {{took part in the}} battle, as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-19, {{carrying}} the EO-16 crew, was delayed {{due to the}} unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. <b>They</b> <b>stayed</b> only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.|$|E

5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> there the glen was always fertile and prosperous.

5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans {{passed over}} the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo's The Last Supper and visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day {{cabriolet}} ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10August, the two men finally reached Rome.|$|E
5|$|After {{an anxious}} journey of nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. <b>They</b> <b>stayed</b> until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear {{the results of a}} {{demonstration}} by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York City, <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> {{for several days}} and an exhibition game was organised. The match was played in Brooklyn and {{was supposed to be}} New Zealand versus New York, however several New Zealanders played for New York to make up their numbers. Despite this New Zealand won the match. The team then travelled to San Francisco, via the Niagara Falls, Chicago, and the Grand Canyon. In San Francisco they played two matches against British Columbia; the first won 43–6 and the second 65–6. From there they sailed back to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. <b>They</b> <b>stayed</b> {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where <b>they</b> <b>stayed</b> {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, the troops were transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E
