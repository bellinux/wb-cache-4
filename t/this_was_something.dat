5|$|The bill {{received}} Royal Assent on 13 August 1888 with Hanley listed {{among those}} places {{to be granted}} county borough status. The corporation of Hanley vacillated for several months as to how best to proceed, then in February 1889 opted for Hanley to take its county borough status, effectively killing both the county proposal and the county borough proposal. Why Hanley corporation made such a decision is not recorded, but it {{was reported in the}} Staffordshire Sentinel of 5 February 1901 that it was because Stoke Corporation insisted that the administrative centre of the new county be in Stoke, not Hanley, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that Hanley could not agree too.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches and back into the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E

25|$|Ponsonby {{played only}} once more that summer, but the {{following}} year he made the only first-class fifty of his career, scoring exactly 50 not out for Worcestershire against Surrey, this time batting at seven. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a false dawn where his batting was concerned: he did not play again for the county until 1920 (though he batted at five for MCC against Oxford University in 1914), and his Worcestershire batting average never again broke into double figures for a season.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to make accurate generalizations about reverse imagery, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that varied by emperor, some trends do exist. An example is reverse types of the military emperors {{during the second half of}} the third century, where virtually all of the types were the common and standard personifications and deities. A possible explanation for the lack of originality is that these emperors were attempting to present conservative images to establish their legitimacy, something that many of these emperors lacked. Although these emperors relied on traditional reverse types, their portraits often emphasized their authority through stern gazes, and even featured the bust of the emperor clad in armor.|$|E

25|$|George Grenville became prime {{minister}} in April 1763 after {{the failure of the}} short-lived Bute Ministry, and he {{had to find a way}} to pay for this large peacetime army. Raising taxes in Britain was out of the question, since there had been virulent protests in England against the Bute ministry's 1763 cider tax, with Bute being hanged in effigy. The Grenville ministry therefore decided that Parliament would raise this revenue by taxing the American colonists without their consent. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> new; Parliament had previously passed measures to regulate trade in the colonies, but it had never before directly taxed the colonies to raise revenue.|$|E
25|$|Womack and {{her husband}} are best friends with Scott Maslen and his wife Estelle Rubio. They have known each other since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{separating}} {{church and state}} is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority {{in the realm of}} individual conscience, as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.|$|E

25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio thought that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that required skill—almost {{as if it were}} a reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} By the Way (2002), the Chili Peppers {{decided that}} they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. In the past, Rubin had given the band creative freedom on their recording material; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Originally the album was headed in a much different direction than the final production. The album {{started out as a}} group of fast, hardcore punk songs, which Rubin rejected. Frusciante also wanted a darker, 1980s UK pop/new wave sound mixed in with 1980s hardcore. The recording process was tough for Flea, who felt like an outsider in the band and that his role was being diminished due to a musical power struggle with Frusciante. Flea wanted to create more funk-inspired songs, while Frusciante felt that the band had overused their funk side. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two eventually worked out all their problems.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} this {{facility}} {{was such that}} a purpose-built Idiot Asylum was then constructed in 1872 near Grove Road for £10,000. The construction of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> of a national event: representatives of 100 Masonic Lodges marched from Knowle Station {{to take part in}} the laying of the foundation stone, which was set in place using the same mallet used by King Charles the Second to lay the foundation stone of Saint Paul's Cathedral in London. The asylum was funded mainly by the local Counties of the Midlands, but George Fredrick Muntz sponsored competition with a prize of £100 for the best design. It provided for housing idiot children from all over the Midlands. It is perhaps telling that in 1867 it was renamed to be the 'Midland Counties Middleclass Idiots Asylum' and although subsidised, families typically had to pay an annual fee to have their children placed there. This was extended in 1893 and evolved into the Middlefield Hospital which existed on the same site until the 1990s, having been adopted by the National Health Service in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislative}} act {{was the result}} of a great deal of negotiation between Waterloo College, Waterloo College Associated Faculties, and St. Jerome's College, another denominational college in the City of Waterloo. While the agreements sought to safeguard the existence of the two denominational colleges, they also aimed at federating them with the newly established University of Waterloo. Due to disagreements with Waterloo College, the College was not formally federated with the new university. The dispute centred on a controversially worded section of the University of Waterloo Act, 1959, in which the College interpreted certain sections as a guarantee that it would become the Faculty of Art for the new university. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that the Associated Faculties was not prepared to accept. As a result of the controversy, Waterloo College's entire Department of Mathematics broke away from the College to join the newly established University of Waterloo, later joined by professors from the Economic, German, Modern Languages, and Russian departments. Despite this controversy, until 1960 Hagey hoped that a last-minute compromise between Waterloo College and the University could be achieved. Ultimately, however, the University created its own Faculty of Arts in 1960. It later established the first Faculty of Mathematics in North America on 1 January 1967. In 1967, the world's first department of kinesiology was created. The present {{legislative act}} which defines how the university should be governed, the University of Waterloo Act, 1972 was passed on 10 May 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{visit of}} Pope John Paul II to Ireland in September {{proved to be}} a welcome break for Lynch from the day-to-day running of the country. In November, just before Lynch {{departed}} on a visit to the United States he decided that he would resign {{at the end of the}} year. This would allow him to complete his term as President of the European Community. The defining event which made up his mind was the news that Fianna Fáil had lost two by-elections in his native Cork (Cork City and Cork North-East, both on 7 November). In addition during the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with the Washington Post that a five-kilometre air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with Thatcher to enhance security co-operation <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> highly unsavoury to many in Fianna Fáil. When Lynch returned he was confronted openly by Síle de Valera, Dr Bill Loughnane, a noted hardline Republican backbencher, along with Tom McEllistrim, a member of Haughey's gang of five, at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey caucusing opinion within the party.|$|E
