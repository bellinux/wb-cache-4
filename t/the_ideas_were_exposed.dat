40|$|Abstract: Ranking of {{alternatives}} is a common, difficult and repeatedly addressed problem, {{especially when it}} requires negotiation of experts. The celebrated Arrow’s impossibility theorem expresses formally its difficulty. In spite of the progress made by adopting soft ranking, the problem {{is far from being}} generically solved. The paper provides a, probably novel, problem formulation by viewing ranking {{of alternatives}} as an estimation of an unknown objective ranking vector. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> on a specific task of ranking quality of projects by a large group of experts. The task is important on its own but the proposed methodology is the main message worth of generalisation and use in other application domains...|$|R

We focus thereinafter specifically on financial market applications. NNs have not gained full acceptance here yet. One of the main reasons is the "Black Box" problem (lack of the NN decisions explanatory power). There are though some NN decisions rule extraction methods like decompositional, pedagogical or eclectic, but they suffer from low portability of the rule extraction technique across various neural net architectures, high level of granularity, algorithmic sophistication of the rule extraction technique etc. The authors propose to eliminate some known drawbacks using an innovative extension of the pedagogical approach. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> by <b>the</b> use of a widespread MLP neural net (as a common tool in the financial problems' domain) and SOM (input data space clusterization).

Here we collect data from a popular system and investigate the statistical properties of tag co-occurrence. We introduce a stochastic model of user behavior embodying two main aspects of collaborative tagging: (i) a frequency-bias mechanism related to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that users <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to each other's tagging activity; (ii) a notion of memory - or aging of resources - {{in the form of a}} heavy-tailed access to the past state of the system.

This points in the direction of a universal behavior of users, who - despite the complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish nature of their tagging activity - appear to follow simple activity patterns.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of online social networks, {{recommender}} systems have became crucial {{for the success of}} many online applications/services due to their significance role in tailoring these applications to user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasing popularity, in general recommender systems suffer from the data sparsity and the cold-start problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting trust information in recommendation process stems from the observation that <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> we <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user communities, in addition to trust relations, the distrust relations also exist between users. For instance, in Epinions the concepts of personal "web of trust" and personal "block list" allow users to categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. In this paper, we propose a matrix factorization based model for recommendation in social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming {{to improve the quality of}} recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions data set, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard trust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems.

40|$|With {{the advance}} of {{fabrication}} technology into the deep sub-micron era process parameter variations, temperature, and voltage fluctuations start to induce large variations into the delay of integrated circuits. The smaller the feature size the larger the variations become, and thus also their in-fluence on the critical path delay of a logic stage in a pipelined structure. Traditionally, the critical path delay variations are dealt with by augment-ing the critical path delay with a safety margin (over design) that {{is large enough to}} cover the worst case scenario. Due to the increasing variability the performance gap between this worst-case clocking method and the po-tential performance is increasing resulting into a massive underutilization of the technology.

We evaluate our recommendations via a large-scale user study on Twitter users that were actively involved in the discussion of the US elections results. Results shows that, in most cases, the factors taken into account in the recommendation affect the users as expected, and thus capture the essential features of the problem.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of classical conditioning {{procedures in the}} attainment of physiological responses of craving for substance consumption stands out in the fi eld of addictive disorders (Tiffany, 1994). In the context of food disorders, food intake (unconditioned stimulus or US) is repeatedly associated with certain conditioned stimuli (CS) that can be both external (places, contexts, specifi c times, sight, smell or food texture), or internal (negative moods, feelings of loneliness, sadness, boredom, etc.). The presence of these cues generates a state of anticipatory anxiety that precedes eating binges. From a clinical perspective, and following Jansen’s conditioning model of binge eating (1998), binge eating could be treated by intervening on the association between previous stimuli and the resulting physiological responses {{that are responsible for}} the appearance of an intense urge to eat. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to individually <b>expose</b> patients to the eliciting stimuli with the purpose of extinguishing these conditioned responses and manage to spread this extinction to the different contexts that are meaningful for the patient.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{commonly used}} by malware for hiding on a targeted {{system is the}} host-based code injection attack. It allows malware to execute its code in a foreign process space enabling it to operate covertly and access critical information of other processes. Since there exists a plethora of different ways for injecting and executing code in a foreign process space, a generic approach spanning all these possibilities is needed. Approaches just focussing on low-level operating system details (e. g. API hooking) do not suffice since the suspicious API set is constantly extended. Thus, approaches focussing on low level operating system details are prone to miss novel attacks. Furthermore, such approaches are restricted to intimate knowledge of exactly one operating system. In this paper, we present Bee Master, a novel approach for detecting host-based code injection attacks. Bee Master applies the honeypot paradigm to OS processes and by {{that it does not}} rely on low-level OS details. <b>The</b> basic <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to <b>expose</b> regular OS processes as a decoy to malware.

To test the capabilities of our approach, we evaluated Bee Master qualitatively and quantitatively on Microsoft Windows and Linux.

40|$|Masters by ResearchMy {{research}} {{involved the}} use of sound and the visual image, to show the development of time through a multi-screen installation that allowed the sixty minutes to unfold from a fixed camera position. The work looked at {{the use of}} multi-screen projections {{and what they can}} lend to an installation and how the audience understands them. This work also explores <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of whether it is important to construct a narrative in an audio/visual installation for an audience or whether they would understand the concept without any manipulation. The concept of the piece is about what occurs between the hours of 4 - 5 am. To help demonstrate my findings I decided to produce a series of films that all lasted for sixty minutes each. The films were unedited, fixed camera shots that observe the action to capture reality and never attempt to follow and construct one. I felt Andre Bazin’s technique of ‘pure cinema’ with long shots was the most appropriate way of achieving this. I believed the best way to illustrate this would be to build up the screens from a one screen painterly shot through to multi-screens progressing from a triptych to five, seven and finally a nine screen film which was full of images. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to <b>expose</b> various spaces, their differences during the time period and suggest how all are occurring concurrently during this one solitary hour. In conclusion, it’s becomes obvious that a viewer of an installation can construct their own narrative. The viewer has the ability to construct their own structured narrative with a start, middle and end depending on when they entered the installation. The installation is important because it allowed the viewer to become immersed in the subject and interact with the films and not just become a passive observer. The use of natural sound added to the atmosphere created through the fixed camera films. The fixed camera filming allowed for observation of the time period capturing what was in front of the lens and never following the action, the use of multi-screens meant more information could be disseminated to the viewer without the need for film editing and manipulation. The multi-screen images allowed the viewer to generate their own perceptions of the time period. They also allowed the viewer to make links between the different locations, seasons and time zones...|$|R

Besides the hardware which can compensate for delay variations, the AICBP design also includes a number of smart mechanisms which can resolve timing errors and improve performance. The area overhead of the AICBP design is relatively small in comparison to other state-of-the-art proposals, since it does not require the augmentation of circuitry at the flip-flop level {{as is the case with}} some designs for variability. Some high level simulations have been done and these indicate an up to 46 % performance improvement. However, this performance improvement depends heavily on the specific delay variations and the properties of the combinatorial logic. Two extensions to the basic AICBP design are presented in this thesis as well. One of these includes an advanced recovery mechanism and the other focuses on data dependent delay compensation techniques. These extensions allow the performance to be improved, but the cost in terms of area and also power is quite high.

40|$|Non-metallic {{flexible}} pipes {{are widely}} used in industry. They are comprised of fabric wrapped over a spiral metal framework. Due to this construction, they respond very well to bending and they are cheaper and much easier to install than metal pipes. Because of the specific construction, the pipe walls are corrugated and the fabric which covers the steel spiral is much rougher than {{the wall of a}} metal pipe. In this investigation we are interested in estimating the friction factor for the flow in this type of pipes. Two-equation turbulence models (k -?? and k -!) are used in the computations. The process of deriving these models is presented first. Then we look at turbulent boundary layers and the law of the wall which gives the velocity profile near the wall. Its use as a boundary condition is explained. After <b>the</b> theoretical <b>ideas</b> have <b>been</b> <b>exposed,</b> we look at fully developed turbulent flow in a conventional pipe. Simulations are performed to validate the chosen models, boundary conditions and computational grids. Then a new boundary condition is implemented based on the 2 ̆ 2 combined 2 ̆ 2 law of the wall. It enables us to model the effects of roughness. The new boundary condition is validated by performing simulations of turbulent flow in rough pipes and comparing the computed friction factor to the one given by the Moody diagram. Finally, turbulent flow in periodically corrugated (flexible) pipes is considered. New flow phenomena (such as flow separation) caused by the corrugation are pointed out and the essence of periodically fully developed flow is explained. The friction factor for different values of relative roughness of the fabric is estimated by performing a series of simulations. Conclusions are drawn {{based on the results of}} the computations. Some of them are that the k - ?? model performs slightly better than the k - ! model in predicting both regular and separated flow and that the friction factor in a flexible corrugated pipe is mostly determined by the shape and size of the steel spiral, and not by the type of the fabric which is wrapped around the spiral...|$|R
