50|$|The ECTS <b>Transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>Records,</b> {{created as}} part of the Bologna Process, preferably includes, along with the local grades, the ECTS grades of the student. It is used for mobile {{students}} at two separate moments. First, it must be issued and sent to the host institution by the home institution for all outgoing students before their departure in order to provide information about the course units/modules that they already have completed and the results obtained. Secondly it must be issued and sent by the host institution to the home institution for all incoming students {{at the end of their}} period of study.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>Records</b> and Diploma Supplements are {{a fairly}} recent {{development}} in most European countries.

Even today there are still European universities that {{are not ready to}} issue Transcripts or Diploma Supplements. Unlike in the US, there does not typically exist in Europe a system of schools directly mailing transcripts to other schools, something that also would be problematic in view of European privacy laws.|$|E
50|$|If {{any changes}} are {{needed on the}} {{learning}} agreement, both the changes and the newly prepared aquivalence document must {{be sent back to}} the home institution to follow the same track to be valid.

We make sure that the recognition is complete and all the courses passed by the student at the host institution are fully recognised by the department provided that they were pre-discussed and agreed up on by the student and the departmental recognition committee.|$|E

5000|$|The ECTS {{grade is}} not meant to replace the local grades but to be used {{optionally}} and additionally to effectively [...] "translate" [...] and [...] "transcript" [...] a grade from one institution to another. The ECTS grade is indicated alongside the mark awarded by the host institution on the student's <b>transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> The receiving institutions then convert the ECTS grade to their own system. Higher education institutions are recommended (though not forced) to provide ECTS grades for all of their students and {{to take into account the}} ECTS grades awarded by other institutions. A certain amount of flexibility is advised, since the ECTS grading scale was designed to improve transparency of a variety of grading systems and cannot, by itself, cover all possible cases.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{integration}} into the European higher education area, Karadeniz Technical University ensures recognition of credits received in another higher education institution with which it has bilateral agreements, provided that the courses taken by the students are pre-agreed on by the departmental committee. Therefore, the students wishing to study abroad under the Erasmus+ programme are asked to get their learning agreements approved by their departments before application to the host institution. The signatures on the learning agreement assure the exchange students that their credits will be recognised and incorporated into their <b>transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> as courses taken abroad. To ensure the recognition, the students are also asked to prepare a document of course equivalence in which the courses to be taken abroad and those they will be considered equal with after the mobility period are shown. This document, which is signed by the student {{and the members of}} the recognition committee of the department composed of the head of department, the Erasmus+ coordinator and the staff member responsible for course equivalence, and signed and stamped by the dean following a discussion in the faculty board, is a guarantor for the student in question showing that the courses to be taken abroad will be recognised as shon on the document.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to illustrate the cultural diversity evaluation in educational learning groups. Our research analyzes the intercultural competency of two groups of students studying in culturally diverse groups. The evaluation assessment was based on a set of tests measuring socio-cultural intelligence and group behaviour. Two learning groups composed of 68 subjects (experimental group) and 70 subjects (witness group) were used for the sample. In order to more suitably evaluate the learning groups’ cultural diversity, the results obtained along with the educational performance of the learning groups (shown by their partial <b>transcript</b> <b>of</b> <b>records)</b> were taken into account. The research variables used were: age, nationality, residence (urban/rural), high school graduate and profile. Statistical processing was implemented using a specific IT platform developed in order to evaluate the cultural diversity of the groups and to send immediate feed-back to the subjects after completing each test...|$|E
