5|$|The {{city was}} planned for {{a maximum of}} 250,000 inhabitants, and an {{additional}} area in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> reserved for further development.|$|E
5|$|Clayton used various {{tactics to}} pay for the needed {{infrastructure}} changes in the state. Most of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> in desperate need of infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in this respect. He raised taxes, tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and flooded the state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and drove up the state debt.|$|E
5|$|During Bobby Dodd's tenure, Georgia Tech {{played against}} several {{integrated}} football teams while <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> resisting integration. Georgia Tech played against Notre Dame in 1953 with Wayne Edmonds starting at offensive tackle and defensive {{end for the}} Irish. Edmonds {{was the first black}} player to win a monogram at Notre Dame. Georgia Tech lost to Notre Dame 27-14.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> town <b>is</b> <b>south</b> of <b>the</b> Granite Mountains, Providence Mountains, and the Mojave National Preserve. Adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{landmark}} Amboy Crater, {{and beyond}} {{to the southeast}} the Bullion Mountains. To <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> Bristol Dry Lake and Cadiz, California.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{rocky beach}} area to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> ideal for fishing and exploring rock pools whilst {{the beach to}} <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> usually calm and shallow for some distance, making it an ideal beach for families with young children.|$|R
5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. His grip on <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|Issued loans {{accounted}} for roughly 21% {{of the finance}} of Confederate war expenditure. In fact, initially <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> more successful in selling debt than the North, partially because New Orleans was a major financial center, whose financiers bought up two-fifths of a 15 million dollar loan in early 1861.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, due to {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} situation and communications difficulties, a degree of confusion emerged on both sides. Out of contact with their corps headquarters, the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać-Petrovac road, {{despite the fact that}} the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear. The critically important Petrovac-Ključ road to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> left unguarded, endangering Tito and Supreme Partisan Headquarters as they fled from Drvar.|$|E

5|$|The French {{primarily}} {{viewed the}} colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed {{and had to}} rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the Sara of <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Tiratur built a square-planned gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in 1648. It {{functioned as}} a church during the 19th century, called Surb Gevorg. To {{the west of the}} narthex was a 17th-century three-arched open-air porch; to the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> the 17th-century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian cuneiform inscriptions were used as lintels on their western entrances.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} taken from the Palace of Whitehall that was the {{residence}} of Kings Henry VIII through to William III, before its destruction by fire in 1698; only the Banqueting House survived. Whitehall was originally a wide road that led {{to the front of the}} palace; the route to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> widened in the 18th century following the destruction of the palace.|$|E
5000|$|... 90 km to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> east <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{capital of}} the Piura Region, Piura, and 160 km to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> located Chiclayo, {{commercial}} centre of the Lambayeque region.|$|R

5|$|The south, {{east and}} west ranges of third {{quadrangle}} contain elements of St Mary Hall, which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; {{less than a decade}} later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} factors {{that led to}} Union victory over the Confederacy, and Davis {{recognized}} {{from the start that}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> at a distinct disadvantage; but in the end, Lincoln helped to achieve victory, whereas Davis contributed to defeat.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, {{displaying}} the personal initiative that would characterize his later career, seized Paducah, Kentucky, a major transportation hub of rail and port facilities {{at the mouth}} of the Tennessee River. Henceforth, neither adversary respected Kentucky's proclaimed neutrality, and the Confederate advantage was lost. The buffer zone that Kentucky provided between the North and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> no longer available to assist in the defense of Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{dawn the}} first {{attack by the}} Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began, when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars. Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in {{capturing}} Johnny II, {{the second of the}} small hills. Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties. At 09:00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS Newfoundland, which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions. The naval gunfire had the desired effect, causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> restricted to harassing machine gun fire. A grass fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived throughout all regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E
50|$|To <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> there <b>is</b> a stone {{bridge across}} the river. Built in 1766, it {{originally}} cost £292-10s-0d. The road leading into Radwell from <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>is</b> Radwell Road and frequently floods after heavy rain.|$|R
25|$|The {{climate of}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>is</b> also oceanic but warmer.|$|R
50|$|Saraiki {{areas in}} <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>are</b> equally rich in folklore.|$|R
5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>was</b> in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Ayla city (modern day Aqaba) in {{southern}} Jordan also came under Byzantine Empire rule. The Aqaba Church was built around 300 AD, {{and is considered}} to be the world's first purpose built Christian church. The Byzantines built 16 churches just south of Amman in Umm ar-Rasas. Administratively the area of Jordan fell under the Diocese of the East, and was divided between the provinces of Palaestina Secunda in the north-west and Arabia Petraea in the south and east. Palaestina Salutaris in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> split off from Arabia Petraea in the late 4th century. The Sassanian Empire in the east became the Byzantines' rivals, and frequent confrontations sometimes led to the Sassanids controlling some parts of the region, including Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ramesses XI in 1078BC, Smendes assumed {{authority}} over {{the northern part of}} Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. <b>The</b> <b>south</b> <b>was</b> effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only. During this time, Berber tribes from what was later to be called Libya had been settling in the western delta, and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945BC, founding the Libyan Berber, or Bubastite, dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.|$|E
