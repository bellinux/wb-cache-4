40|$|UK {{mental health}} policy {{increasingly}} emphasises {{the necessity to}} involve service users in aspects of service planning, practice and evaluation. There is also a growing self-organised user movement, demanding greater and more sophisticated levels of such participation. Despite this apparent consensus between policy makers and service users, explicit guidance for implementation is lacking and, arguably, staff resistance and other institutional barriers {{stand in the way}} of systematic and meaningful involvement. Historically, mental health services have reproduced various societal structural inequalities in the treatment of women service users, in particular. Service user perspectives, motivations and accounts of experiences of active involvement are relatively under-represented in the published literature. This study utilised discourse analysis of texts generated by semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in mental health services to explore the ways in which these participants make sense of the notion of user involvement. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> included <b>samples</b> of both staff and service users. Twelve staff were interviewed including practitioners, managers and hospital chaplain. Eight service users were interviewed including, service users, service user representatives and a service user advocate. The findings indicate three broad discourses in the service user narratives. The first discourse constructs different dimensions of identity. Second, is a discourse that expresses ideas coalescing around notions of gender. The third discourse constructs the organisation within which the service user activism takes place. The staff draw upon these same discourses, and also draw upon staff identity in relation to service users and service user involvement. These discourses are presented as affording potential to make a contribution to informed development of mental health services such that user involvement initiatives are better supported and sustained. They are also available to the user movement itself to draw upon in their ongoing political and practical engagement with services and forms of organised involvement...|$|R

This {{study examined the}} application of this approach on stroke knowledge acquisition and changing individual lifestyle risk factors in an outpatient clinic. METHODS RCT in which 200 participants were allocated to an education-counselling interview (ECI) or a control group. ECI group participants mapped their individual risk factors on a stage of change model and received an appointment to the next group lifestyle class. Participants completed a stroke knowledge questionnaire at baseline (T 1), post-appointment, and three months (T 3) post-appointment. Passive to active changes in lifestyle behaviour were self-reported at three months. RESULTS There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between groups from T 1 toT 3 in stroke knowledge (p < 0. 001). While there was a significant shift from a passive to active stage of change for <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> (p < 0. 000), {{there was no significant difference}} between groups on the identified risk factors.

40|$|Abstract Analysis {{of cancer}} family history (CFH) offers a {{low-cost}} genetic tool to identify familial cancer predisposition. In middle-income settings, {{the scarcity of}} individual records and database-linked records hinders the assessment of self-reported CFH consistency {{as an indicator of}} familial cancer predisposition. We used self-reported CFH to identify those families at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes in community-based primary care centers of a low-income Brazilian area. We also evaluated the consistency of the information collected by reassessing CFH five years later. We interviewed 390 families and constructed their pedigrees for genetic cancer risk assessment. We found 125 families affected by cancer, 35. 2 % with moderate to high risk of familial susceptibility to cancer, a number that represents a relatively high prevalence of potential hereditary cancer syndromes in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample.</b> Upon reassessment of CFH in 14 / 20 families that were previously identified as having at least one first-degree and one second-degree relative affected by cancer, and presented moderate to high risk for developing cancer, 90 % of initial pedigrees were confirmed. These results demonstrate the reliability of self-reports as a means of early identification of healthy individuals at risk, encouraging the wider use of this method in low- and middle-income primary care settings...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension and {{diabetes}} mellitus are leading health {{concerns in the}} United States. Despite a disproportionate burden of both conditions among African Americans, {{it is estimated that}} 44 % of diabetes cases and one quarter of hypertension cases within this population are undiagnosed.

40|$|Introductions of Encarsia dispersa Polaszek (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) for the {{biological}} control of spiralling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus Russell (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), were made directly onto Thursday Island, Torres Strait Queensland, in May 1994. Its efficacy was monitored intermittently for 7 years on 10 Acalypha wilkesiana Mull. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae) and two Terminalia catappa L. (Combretaceae) plants. Marked declines in whitefly densities were recorded on all hosts approximately 10 months after parasitoid releases. Declines in whitefly densities {{over the first}} 2 years were mostly matched with increases in per cent parasitism; these declines generally coinciding with wet seasons, with small resurgences occurring over the first dry season following the first decline. Whitefly densities and per cent leaves infested on T. catappa, and on A. wilkesiana with flat leaves were low by {{the latter half of}} the study. In contrast, A. wilkesiana with convoluted leaves seemed to inhibit the parasitoid by providing physical refuges for whitefly nymphs, resulting in higher whitefly numbers with low parasitism, particularly in dry conditions. Ten to 12 years after these initial declines, whitefly densities have remained low. Adults and larvae of Cryptolaemus affinis Crotch (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and larvae of Acletoxenus quadristriatus Duda (Diptera: Drosophilidae) were observed preying on whitefly nymphs during <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> <b>Overall,</b> <b>sampling</b> data suggested that A. dispersus was under biological control. It may be prudent to maintain A. wilkesiana with convoluted leaves (acting as host refuges) on the Torres Strait islands to retain parasitoid persistence, thereby maintaining controlled and stable populations of A. dispersus.

40|$|Background: Occurrence {{of early}} {{miscarriage}} in pregnancies accomplished by {{in vitro fertilisation}} procedures was studied, almost exclusively, in women in whom cleavage stage embryos were transferred. The primary objective of our retrospective {{study was to identify}} the factors predicting early miscarriage following the transfer of one or two blastocysts. Materials and Methods: Using the multivariate logistic regression model, we analyzed the parameters of 1020 sequential IVF/ICSI cycles with the transfer of one or two blastocysts, in which positive levels of βhCG were observed. Age of the patient, fertilization method, number of retrieved oocytes, number of developed, frozen and transferred blastocysts and their quality were analyzed as possible predictors for early spontaneous miscarriage. Results: <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> frequency of biochemical pregnancies in the observed group of patients was 6. 6 % (67 / 1020). Biochemical pregnancies occurred somewhat more frequently following the transfer of one, rather than two blastocysts (9. 05 % (23 / 254) vs. 5. 8 % (44 / 763)). The rate of early clinical miscarriage was 13. 3 % (136 / 1020), with the rate of miscarriage higher following the transfer of one as opposed to two blastocysts (15. 3 % (39 / 254) vs. 12. 7 (97 / 763)). If biochemical pregnancies and early clinical miscarriages were observed together, the rate of early pregnancy losses in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>sample</b> <b>studied</b> was 19. 9 % (203 / 1020), following the transfer of one blastocyst 24. 4 % (62 / 254) and following the transfer of two 18. 4 % (141 / 763). Using the multivariate logistic regression, we demonstrated that statistically significant predictors for early spontaneous miscarriages were the patient’s age (OR = 1. 098; 95 % CI 1. 057 – 1. 140, P < 0. 001), the number of blastocysts transferred (OR = 0. 592; 95 % CI 0. 412 – 0. 851, P = 0. 005), the quality of blastocysts transferred (OR= 0. 666; 95 % CI 0. 468 – 0. 949; P = 0. 024), as well as the number of blastocysts frozen (OR = 0. 912; 95 % CI 0. 832 – 0. 999; P = 0. 048).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the extent of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ability impairment in newly arrived Danish asylum seekers. It was hypothesized that exposure to trauma and torture would negatively influence ADL performance and that measures of ADL ability would be lower in individuals exposed to torture as compared to the non-tortured. SUBJECTS: Forty-three newly arrived asylum seekers aged 20 - 50 years, from Iran, Afghanistan and Syria, were consecutively included in the study. METHOD: ADL ability was assessed with the observation-based test Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Interviews were based on questionnaires about torture exposure, WHO- 5 Wellbeing Index, Major Depression Inventory and Pain Detect Questionnaire. All participants were interviewed and tested using a linguistic interpreter. RESULTS: Thirty three (77 %) participants reported exposure to torture. The tortured did not differ significantly from the nontortured on measures of ADL ability (two-sample t-tests: Motor, p= 0. 36; Process, p= 0. 82). ADL performance impairment was observed in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample.</b> Twelve had motor and 15 process ability measures below age norms and 2 below both AMPS motor and process cut-offs for effortless and efficient ADL performance. There were statistically significant - weak to moderate - correlations between self-reported psychological distress, VAS average pain, pain distribution and the AMPS measures. CONCLUSION: The study results supported significant ADL ability impairment in tortured as well as non-tortured newly arrived asylum seekers. Implementation of performance-based evaluation of ADL ability as part of the initial medical screening of this particular population should be considered...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In view of {{the reduced}} number of hours devoted to sleep in modern western {{societies}} the question arises what effects might result from sleep duration on occurrence of chronic diseases. METHODS: Data from 23 620 middle-aged participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Potsdam study, that were recruited between 1994 - 1998, were analyzed by using Cox proportional hazard regression to examine the association between self-reported sleep duration at baseline and incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 7. 8 years 841 incident cases of type 2 diabetes, 197 cases of myocardial infarction, 169 incident strokes, and 846 tumor cases were observed. Compared to persons sleeping 7 -< 8 h/day, participants with sleep duration of < 6 h had a significantly increased risk of stroke (Hazard Ratio (HR)  =  2. 06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 18 - 3. 59), cancer (HR =  1. 43, 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 1. 87), and overall chronic diseases (HR =  1. 31, 95 % CI: 1. 10 - 1. 55) in multivariable adjusted models. Self-reported daytime sleep at baseline {{was not associated with}} incident chronic diseases in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample.</b> However, there had been an effect modification of daytime sleep by hypertension showing that daytime sleep was inversely related to chronic disease risk among non-hypertensive participants but directly related to chronic diseases among hypertensives.

40|$|Alcoholism is {{a chronic}} {{psychiatric}} disorder affecting neural pathways that regulate motivation, stress, reward and arousal. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates mood, response to stress and interacts with neurotransmitters and stress systems involved in reward pathways and addiction. Aim {{of the study}} was to evaluate the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val 66 Met or rs 6265) and alcohol related phenotypes in Caucasian patients. In ethnically homogenous Caucasian subjects of the Croatian origin, the BDNF Val 66 Met genotype distribution was determined in 549 male and 126 female patients with alcohol dependence and in 655 male and 259 female healthy non-alcoholic control subjects. Based on the structured clinical interview, additional detailed clinical interview, the Brown-Goodwin Scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Clinical Global Impression scores, alcoholic patients were subdivided into those with or without comorbid depression, aggression, delirium tremens, withdrawal syndrome, early/late onset of alcohol abuse, prior suicidal attempt during lifetime, current suicidal behavior, and severity of alcohol dependence. The results showed no significant association between BDNF Val 66 Met variants and alcohol dependence and/or any of the alcohol related phenotypes in either Caucasian women, or men, with alcohol dependence. There are few limitations of the study. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> size was large (N = 1589) but not well-powered to detect differences in BDNF Val 66 Met genotype distribution between studied groups.

40|$|Principal Topic: For forward {{thinking}} companies, {{the environment}} {{may represent the}} "biggest opportunity for enterprise and invention the industrial world has ever seen" (Cairncross 1990). Increasing awareness of environmental and sustainability issues through media including the promotion of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" has seen increased awareness of environmental and sustainability issues and increased demand for business processes that reduce detrimental environmental impacts of global development (Dean & McMullen 2007). The increased demand for more environmentally sensitive products and services represents {{an opportunity for the}} development of ventures that seek to satisfy this demand through entrepreneurial action. As a consequence, increasing recent market developments in renewable energy, carbon emissions, fuel cells, green building, and other sectors suggest an increasing importance of opportunities for environmental entrepreneurship (Dean and McMullen 2007) and increasingly important area of business activity (Schaper 2005). In the last decade in particular, big business has sought to develop a more "sustainability/ green friendly" orientation as a response to public pressure and increased government legislation and policy to improve environmental performance (Cohen and Winn 2007). Whilst much of the literature and media is littered with examples of sustainability practices of large firms, nascent and young sustainability firms have only recently begun generating strong research and policy interest (Shepherd, Kuskova and Patzelt 2009) : not only for their potential to generate above average financial performance and returns owing to a greater popularity and demand towards sustainability products and services offerings, but also for their intent to lessen environmental impacts, and to provide a more accurate reflection of the "true cost" of market offerings taking into account carbon and environmental impacts. More specifically, researchers have suggested that although the previous focus has been on large firms and their impact on the environment, the estimated collective impact of entries and exits of nascent and young firms in development is substantial and could outweigh the combined environmental impact of large companies (Hillary, 2000). Therefore, it may be argued that greater attention should be paid to nascent and young firms and researching sustainability practices, for both their impact in reducing environmental impacts and potential higher financial performance. Whilst acknowledging this research only uses the first wave of a four year longitudinal study of nascent and young firms, it can still begin to provide initial analysis on which to continue further research. The aim of this paper therefore is to provide an overview of the emerging literature in sustainable entrepreneurship and to present some selected preliminary results from the first wave of the data collection, with comparison, where appropriate, of sustainable and firms that do not fulfil this criteria. "One of the key challenges in evaluating sustainability entrepreneurship is the lack of agreement in how it is defined" (Schaper, 2005 : 10). Some evaluate sustainable entrepreneurs simply as one category of entrepreneurs with little difference between them and traditional entrepreneurs (Dees, 1998). Other research recognises values-based sustainable enterprises requiring a unique perspective (Parrish, 2005). Some see the environmental or sustainable entrepreneurship is a subset of social entrepreneurship (Cohen & Winn, 2007; Dean & McMullen, 2007) whilst others see it as a separate, distinct theory (Archer 2009). Following one of the first definitions of sustainability developed by the Brundtland Commission (1987) we define sustainable entrepreneurship as firms which "seek to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future". [...] Methodology/Key Propositions: In this exploratory paper we investigate sustainable entrepreneurship using Cohen et al. 's (2008) framework to identify strategies of nascent and young entrepreneurial firms. We use data from The Comprehensive Australian Study of Entrepreneurial Emergence (CAUSEE). This study shares the general empirical approach with PSED studies in the US (Reynolds et al 1994; Reynolds & Curtin 2008). <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> uses <b>samples</b> of 727 nascent (not yet operational) firms and another 674 young firms, the latter being in an operational stage but less than four years old. To generate the sub sample of sustainability firms, we used content analysis techniques on firm titles, descriptions and product descriptions provided by respondents. Two independent coders used a predefined codebook developed from our review of the sustainability entrepreneurship literature (Cohen et al. 2009) to evaluate the content based on terms such as "sustainable" "eco-friendly" "renewable energy" "environment" amongst others. The inter-rater reliability was checked and the Kappa's co-efficient was found to be within the acceptable range (0. 746). 85 firms fulfilled the criteria given for inclusion in the sustainability cohort. [...] Results and Implications: The results for this paper are based on Wave one of the CAUSEE survey which has been completed and the data is available for analysis. It is expected that the findings will assist in beginning to develop an understanding of nascent and young firms that are driven to contribute to a society which is sustainable, not just from an economic perspective (Cohen et al 2008), but from an environmental and social perspective as well. The CAUSEE study provides an opportunity to compare the characteristics of sustainability entrepreneurs with entrepreneurial firms without a stated environmental purpose, which constitutes the majority of the new firms created each year, using a large scale novel longitudinal dataset. The results have implications for Government in the design of better conditions for the creation of new business, firms who assist sustainability in developing better advice programs in line with a better understanding of their needs and requirements, individuals who may be considering becoming entrepreneurs in high potential arenas and existing entrepreneurs make better decisions. ...|$|R

We undertook this study to evaluate the association between accumulated flight time in smoky airplane cabins and respiratory tract diseases in a cohort of never smoking flight attendants. Methods We conducted a mailed survey in a cohort of flight attendants. Of 15, 000 mailed questionnaires, 2053 (14 %) were completed and returned. We excluded respondents with a personal history of smoking (n = 748) and non smokers {{with a history of}} respiratory tract diseases before the age of 18 years (n = 298). The remaining 1007 respondents form the study sample. Results <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> was predominantly white (86 %) and female (89 %), {{with a mean age of}} 54 years. Overall, 69. 7 % of the respondents were diagnosed with at least one respiratory tract disease.

40|$|Introduction: Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), {{also called}} {{domestic}} violence, {{is defined as}} any physical, psychological, or sexual violence, and emotional violence perpetrated by an intimate partner (CDC, 2016). Sexual violence or rape {{is defined as a}} sexual act committed against someone without that person’s freely-given consent (CDC, 2017). IPV is experienced among heterosexual women globally, although this phenomenon is not unique to this population. IPV also disproportionately affects young gay, bisexual, and other {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) (Stults et al., 2016). The purpose of this study is to examine the association between IPV victimization and the increased risk of HIV and other health outcomes among YBMSM. Methods: The 6 -month follow-up was conducted in Jackson, MS. A total 600 YBMSM were eligible to participant in the study. The participants were recruited from two local clinics that were focused on diagnosing and treating STI’s. Also, recruiters promoted the opportunity to enroll in the study through social media, attending bars, and nightclubs. Inclusion criteria were: 1) assigned male at birth; 2) self-identification as Black/African American; 3) 15 - 29 years of age; 4) attending the clinic to be tested for HIV or other STIs, 5) having engaged in anal sex with a male partner at least once in the past 6 months, and 6) the ability to speak and comprehend English.

Weight, height and waist circumference measurements were obtained. Participants were invited to complete a four day food diary, over two week and two weekend days. Results The mean BMI of <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> was 29. 4 kg/m 2 ± 6. 1. The mean BMI of men was 28. 8 kg/m 2 and the mean BMI of women was 30. 2 kg/m 2, with 2. 4 % of the sample underweight, 22. 6 % normal weight, 28. 2 % overweight and 46. 8 % obese. Having a diagnosis of Down’s syndrome (p= 0. 03) and greater fried food consumption (p= 0. 041) were associated with increasing BMI. Increasing waist circumference was associated with increasing severity of ID (p= 0. 04). Mean reported energy intakes were 2044 kcal/day for men and 1684 kcal/day for women. Mean energy intakes from sugar, fat and saturated fat are above maximum recommended intakes and few study participants met micronutrient RDAs. Conclusion This study highlights the alarming {{prevalence of}} overweight and obesity in PwID. While under reporting of nutritional intake is suspected in the study participants this study also highlights the poor diet quality of study participants.

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} multicenter {{investigation}} involving four highly specialized tertiary clinics for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) treatment, retrospective analysis of Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) axis I and axis II data gathered on clinic and community cases were assessed with a twofold aim: (1) to search for a correlation between axis I diagnoses and axis II pain-related disability, and (2) to identify clinical (axis I) and psychosocial (axis II) predictors of high pain-related disability. Two samples of patients seeking treatment for TMD (clinic cases, N[*]=[*] 1, 312) and a sample of general population subjects (community cases, N[*]=[*] 211) underwent a thorough assessment in accordance with the RDC/TMD version 1. 0 [1] guidelines to receive both axis I and axis II diagnoses. Spearman’s test was performed to assess the level of correlation between axis I diagnoses and Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) pain-related disability. A stepwise multiple logistic regression model was used to identify the significant associations between 12 clinical and psychosocial predictors and the presence of high pain-related disability. Axis I findings were related with pain-related impairment (GCPS scores) in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> including both clinic community cases (Spearman correlation[*]=[*] 0. 129, p[*]=[*] 0. 000), but the results of the correlation analyses performed on the clinic sample alone were not significant (Spearman correlation[*]=[*]− 0. 018, p[*]=[*] 0. 618). Predictors for high disability were related to axis II findings (severe depression and somatization) or psychosocial aspects related to the pain experience (pain lasting from more than 6 months; treatment-seeking behavior), while none of the axis I diagnoses remained in the final logistic regression model. The final model predicted the level of pain-related impairment at a fair level (R 2 [*]=[*] 26. 7 %). The correlation between axis I diagnoses and pain-related impairment is not significant in the patients populations. Treatment-seeking behavior and other factors related with the pain experience {{are likely to be more}} important than the physical findings to determine the degree of psychosocial impairment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Various methodologic {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the role of risk factors in explaining the social gradient in coronary heart disease (CHD). Our objective was to examine whether there is a discrepancy in results obtained using the relative and absolute approaches. METHODS: Data are from the Whitehall II prospective cohort study on 5363 men who were 40 - to 62 -year-old {{at the start of the}} 11 -year follow-up period. RESULTS: One or more of the 4 conventional risk factors examined (smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) were present for 77 % of individuals in the low socioeconomic group compared with 68 % in the high socioeconomic group. The relative risk for incident CHD in the low socioeconomic group was 1. 66 (95 % confidence interval = 1. 20 to 2. 29) compared with the high group. Standardizing the distribution of risk factors in the low and high socioeconomic group to <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> reduced relative risk by 16 % and absolute risk by 14 %. We also computed the population attributable risk (PAR) to indicate the reduction in CHD if the risk factor were completely removed from the population. The PAR associated with having at least one risk factor was 41 % (95 % confidence interval = 33 % to 57 %) in the high and 58 % (13 % to 91 %) in the low socioeconomic group. CONCLUSIONS: In situations where the goal is to remove social differences in the distribution of risk factors, conventional risk factors explain a similar proportion of the social gradient in CHD, whether using the relative or absolute approaches to change in risk. This is not comparable to population attributable risk calculations, in which the goal is to completely remove the risk factors from the population. Failure to recognize that these methods address different questions seems to be the reason for discrepancies in previous results...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2000, an Italian {{non-governmental}} organisation (NGO) began a 9 -year project {{to establish a}} surgical pathology laboratory at the Bugando Medical Centre (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania, {{a country with a}} low Human Development Index (HDI), and as of 2009, the laboratory was operating autonomously. The present survey aims to evaluate the reproducibility of histological and cytological diagnoses assigned in the laboratory's early years of autonomous activity. We selected a random sample of 196 histological and cytological diagnoses issued in 2010 - 2011 at the BMC surgical pathology laboratory. The corresponding samples were sent to Italy for review by Italian senior pathologists, who were blinded to the local results. Samples were classified into four diagnostic categories: malignant, benign, inflammatory, and suspicious. The two-observer kappa-statistic for categorised (qualitative) data was then calculated to measure diagnostic concordance between the local Tanzanian pathologists and Italian senior pathologists. The k-Cohen was calculated for concordance in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample.</b> Concordance and discordance rates were also stratified by subset: general adult, paediatric/adolescent, and lymphoproliferative histopathological diagnoses; fluid and fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytological diagnoses; and PAP tests. Discordance was also categorised by the corresponding hypothetical clinical implications: high, intermediate, and not significant. Results: Overall concordance was 85. 2 % (167 of 196 diagnoses), with a k-Cohen of 0. 7691 (P = 0. 0000). Very high concordance was observed in the subsets of adult general pathological diagnoses (90 %) and paediatric/adolescent pathological diagnoses (91. 18 %). Concordance in the subset of PAP tests was 75 %, and for fluid/FNA cytological diagnoses it was 56. 52 %. Concordance among 12 histological subtypes of lymphoma was 75. 86 %, with substantial discordance observed in the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma (five cases diagnosed by Italian pathologists versus 2 by local pathologists). The overall proportion of discordance with high hypothetical clinical implications was 6. 1 % (12 diagnoses). Conclusion: This blind review of diagnoses assigned in Tanzania, a country with low HDI, and in Italy, a country with a very high HDI, seemed to be a sensitive and effective method to identify areas of potential error and may represent a reference point for future, more detailed quality control processes or audits of surgical pathology services located in limited-resource regions...|$|E

Methods: Selecting from a repository containing members’ data from 14 regional United States health plans, this validation study identified pneumonia diagnoses within a group of patients initiating treatment for COPD between March 1, 2009 and March 31, 2012. Patients with ≥ 1 claim for pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases Version 9 -CM code 480. xx– 486. xx) were identified during the 12 months following treatment initiation. A subset of 800 patients was randomly selected to abstract medical record data (paper based and electronic) for a target sample of 400 patients, to estimate validity within 5 % margin of error. Positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated for the claims diagnosis of pneumonia relative to the reference standard, defined as a documented diagnosis in the medical record. Results: A total of 388 records were reviewed; 311 included a documented pneumonia diagnosis, indicating 80. 2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 75. 8 % to 84. 0 %) of claims-identified pneumonia diagnoses were validated by the medical charts. Claims-based diagnoses in inpatient or emergency departments (n= 185) had greater PPV versus outpatient settings (n= 203), 87. 6 % (95 % CI: 81. 9 %– 92. 0 %) versus 73. 4 % (95 % CI: 66. 8 %– 79. 3 %), respectively. Claims-diagnoses verified with paper-based charts had similar PPV as <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample,</b> 80. 2 % (95 % CI:  71. 1 %– 87. 5 %), and higher PPV than those linked to electronic medical records, 73. 3 % (95 % CI: 65. 5 %– 80. 2 %). Combined paper-based and electronic records had a higher PPV, 87. 6 % (95 % CI: 80. 9 %– 92. 6 %). Conclusion: Administrative claims data indicating a diagnosis of pneumonia in COPD patients are supported by medical records. The accuracy of a medical record diagnosis of pneumonia remains unknown. With increased use of claims data in medical research, COPD researchers can study pneumonia with confidence that claims data are a valid tool when studying the safety of COPD therapies that could potentially lead to increased pneumonia susceptibility or severity.

40|$|In 2002, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation {{launched}} the ECHSI {{with the primary}} goal of increasing the opportunity for underserved students to earn a postsecondary credential. To achieve this goal, Early Colleges provide underserved students with exposure to, and support in, college while they are in high school. Early Colleges partner with colleges and universities to offer all students an opportunity to earn an associate's degree or up to two years of college credits toward a bachelor's degree during high school at no or low cost to the students. The underlying assumption is that engaging underrepresented students in a rigorous high school curriculum tied to the incentive of earning college credit will motivate them and increase their access to additional postsecondary education and credentials after high school. Since 2002, more than 240 Early Colleges have opened nationwide This study focused on the impact of Early Colleges. It addressed two questions: 1. Do Early College students have better outcomes than they would have had at other high schools? 2. Does the impact of Early Colleges vary by student background characteristics (e. g., gender and family income) ? To answer these questions, we conducted a lottery-based randomized experiment, taking advantage of the fact that some Early Colleges used lotteries in their admissions processes. By comparing the outcomes for students who participated in admissions lotteries and were offered enrollment with the outcomes for students who participated in the lotteries but were not offered enrollment, we can draw causal conclusions about the impact of Early Colleges. The primary student outcomes for this study were high school graduation, college enrollment, and college degree attainment. We also examined students' high school and college experiences. Data on student background characteristics and high school outcomes came from administrative records from schools, districts, and states; data on collegeoutcomes came from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC); and data on high school and college experiences and intermediate outcomes such as college credit accrual camefrom a student survey We assessed the impact of Early Colleges on these outcomes for a sample of 10 Early Colleges that did the following: -Enrolled students in grades 9 [...] 12 and had high school graduates in the study years (2005 [...] 2011) -Used lotteries as part of the admission processes in {{at least one of the}} study cohorts (students who entered ninth grade in 2005 [...] 06, 2006 [...] 07, or 2007 [...] 08) -Retained the lottery records Eight of the 10 Early Colleges in the study were included in the student survey. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> included 2, 458 students and the survey sample included 1, 294 students.
