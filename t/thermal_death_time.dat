Reductions of 99. 99 % (4 -log 10 cycles) of the initial population were estimated for the three moisture conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Degradation {{parameters}} of purified anthocyanins from purple-fleshed potato (cv. Purple Majesty) heated at high temperatures (100150 C) were determined. Purified anthocyanins, prepared by removing salts, sugars, and colorless nonanthocyanin phenolics from the crude extract, were monitored and quantified using HPLC and spectrophotometry for heat-induced degradation products. Separation of colorless phenolics from the anthocyanins was confirmed using HPLC at two wavelengths, 280 and 520 nm. The degradation kinetics of purified anthocyanins followed a first-order reaction with reaction rate constants (k values) of 0. 02620. 2855 min 1, an activation energy of 72. 89 kJ/mol, <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> <b>times</b> (D values) of 8. 068789 min, and a z value of 47. 84 Cover the temperature range of 100150 C.

At a given NaCl concentration in the growth medium, D 47 c values increased with elevated incubation temperatures and with elevated levels of NaCl in the heating menstrua. Differences in thermal resistance of cells cultured at a particular temperature were greater between those grown in TSB containing 0. 5 and 3. 0 % NaCl than between those grown in TSB containing 3. 0 and 7. 5 % NaCl.

The samples were plated on selective modified oxford formulation and nonselective brain heart infusion agar to determine injury and total survivors. Decimal reduction times (D-value) were calculated. The D-values were analyzed by first order response surface regression for temperature, NaL, SDA and pediocin. The observed D-value ranged from 1. 6 to 32 min for franks having different combination of NaL, SDA and pediocin treated at different temperatures according to central composite design. Temperature had the most prominent impact on decreasing the D-value of L. monocytogenes. However, a combination of temperature with pediocin, NaL and SDA was more effective at decreasing the Dvalue of L. monocytogenes as compared to control. A mathematical model describing the combined effects of temperature, Nal, SDA and pediocin on the thermal inactivation of L. monocytogenes was developed. The model can predict D-values for any combination of temperatures, Nal, SDA and pediocin that are within the range of those tested.

40|$|Recognition of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni (referred to {{hereafter}} as C. jejuni) as {{an important}} human pathogen and its isolation from meat products indicate the need for knowledge of its survival characteristics in meats. <b>Thermal</b> <b>death</b> <b>times</b> (D-values) for a single strain and a five-strain composite were determined in 1 % peptone and autoclaved ground chicken meat at temperatures ranging from 49 to 57 degrees C. Survival was determined for these strains in chicken meat at 4, 23, 37, and 43 degrees C. Survival was also determined on raw chicken drumsticks stored at 4 degrees C in either an ambient or a CO 2 atmosphere. D-values were greater in chicken meat than in peptone in all cases. D-values in peptone for strain H- 840 at 49, 51, 53, 55, and 57 degrees C were 15. 2, 4. 90, 1. 71, 0, 64, and 0. 25 min, respectively. The corresponding D-values in ground chicken meat were 20. 5, 8. 77, 4. 85, 2. 12, and 0. 79 min, respectively. Similar results were obtained with a composite of five strains. When sterile ground chicken meat was inoculated with approximately 10 (6) to 10 (7) C. jejuni cells per g and stored at 37 degrees C in an ambient atmosphere, a 1 -to 2 -log count increase occurred during the first 4 days, followed by a gradual decline of about 1 log during {{the remainder of the}} 17 -day storage period. No growth was observed among similarly inoculated samples that were stored at 4, 23, and 43 degrees C but counts declined by about 1 to 2 logs at 4 degrees C (17 day), by 2. 5 to 5 logs at 23 degrees C (17 days), and to undetectable levels at 43 degrees C (between 10 and 16 days). Survival on raw chicken drumsticks stored at 4 degrees C in CO 2 and in an ambient atmosphere declined by about 1. 5 and 2. 0 logs, respectively, during 21 days of storage. The effect of temperature on the survival of C. jejuni in chicken meat was similar to that reported in other natural and laboratory milieus.

40|$|Traditionally, the {{efficacy}} of preservation and disinfection processes has been assessed {{on the basis of}} the assumption that microbial mortality follows a first-order kinetic. However, as departures from this assumed kinetics are quite common, various other models, based on higher-order kinetics or population balance, have also been proposed. The database for either type of models is a set of survival curves of the targeted organism or spores determined under constant conditions, that is, constant temperature, chemical agent concentration, etc. Hence, to calculate the outcome of an actual industrial process, where conditions are changing, as in heating and cooling during a thermal treatment or when the agent dissipates as in chlorination or hydrogen peroxide application, one has to integrate the momentary effects of the lethal agent. This involves mathematical models based on assumed mortality kinetics, and simulated or measured history, for example, temperature-time or concentration-time relationships at the 2 ̆ 2 coldest 2 ̆ 2 point. It is shown that the survival curve under conditions where the agent intensity increases, decreases, or oscillates can be constructed without assuming any mortality kinetics and without the use of the traditional D and Z values, which require linear approximation, and without <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> <b>times,</b> which require extrapolation. The actual survival curves can be compiled from the isothermal survival curves provided that growth and damage repair do not occur over the pertinent time scale and that the mortality rate is a function of only the momentary agent intensity and of the organism 2 ̆ 7 s or spore 2 ̆ 7 s survival fraction (but not of the rate at which this fraction has been reached). The calculation is greatly facilitated if both the 2 ̆ 2 isothermal 2 ̆ 2 survival curves and the time-dependent agent intensity can be expressed algebraically. The differential equation derived from these considerations can be solved numerically to produce the required survival curve under the changing conditions. The concept is demonstrated with simulated survival curves during heating at different rates, heating and cooling cycles, oscillating temperature, and exposure to a dissipating chemical agent. The simulated thermal processes are based on published data of Clostridium botulinum spores, whose semilogarithmic survival curves have upward concavity and on a hypothetical 2 ̆ 2 Listeria-like 2 ̆ 2 organism whose semilogarithmic curves have downward concavity...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} thermosensitive Bacillus subtilis lysyl- and tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleic acid {{synthetase}} mutants (lysS 1 and trypS 1) (l-lysine:transfer ribonucleic acid [tRNA] ligase [AMP], EC 6. 1. 1. 6; and l-tryptophan:tRNA ligase [AMP], EC 6. 1. 1. 2) was terminated when exponential phase cells were shifted from 30 to 43 C {{in a rich}} medium. Under these conditions, the temperature-inhibited cells undergo thermal death; they rapidly lose their ability to form colonies at 30 C. Another lysyl-tRNA synthetase mutant (lysS 2) is refractory to <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> even though its growth is inhibited at 43 C. The <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> response of the lysS 1 mutant {{is affected by the}} stage of cell development. At periods in spore outgrowth and sporogenesis these cells become refractory to <b>thermal</b> <b>death.</b> The refractory state does not result from the production of an inhibitor, or from the degradation of an activator of <b>thermal</b> <b>death.</b> However, culture medium composition does modify the <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> response. Rich media enhance the effect, and no <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> occurs in the lysS 1 strain grown in a minimal medium. Temperature-sensitive cells can grow in a lysine- (0. 25 mM) or tryptophan- (0. 25 mM) supplemented minimal medium at 43 C, but amino acid concentrations of 25 mM only transiently protect trypS 1 and lysS 1 cells from <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> in a rich medium. Osmotic agents such as sucrose (0. 5 M) and NaCl (0. 34 M) completely prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> in the lysS 1 strain, although growth is still arrested.

Chloramiphenicol increased the rate of <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> of the lysS 1 strain but decreased the <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> response of the trypS 1 mutant. Considering the nature of the enzyme defect in the lysS 1 strain, the common genetic origin of the spore and vegetative lysyl-tRNA synthetase, and the protective effects exerted by lysine and osmotic agents, it is tentatively concluded that <b>thermal</b> <b>death</b> results from irreversible inactivation of the mutant gene product.
