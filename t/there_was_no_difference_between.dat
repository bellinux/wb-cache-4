25|$|The {{database}} {{features of}} the HyperCard system {{are based on the}} storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system was considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field caused that text to be stored to the stack's physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.|$|E
