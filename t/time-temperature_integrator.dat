A study of the reaction mechanism indicates that furfuryl ethyl ether is most likely formed by protonation of furfuryl alcohol or furfuryl acetate followed by S(N) 2 -substitution of the leaving group by the nucleophilic ethanol. For the reaction in beer, a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics was derived. A close correlation was found between the values predicted by the kinetic model and the actual furfuryl ethyl ether concentration evolution during storage of beer. Furthermore, 10 commercial beers of different types, aged during 4 years in natural conditions, were analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} furfuryl ethyl ether flavor threshold was largely exceeded in each type of beer.

40|$|Thermal {{treatment}} {{is the most}} common method used by industry to ensure food is safe for consumption and to increase storage life. To ensure safety, food is often over processed, which can significantly affect its nutritional value as well as taste and flavour attributes. In this study a candidate sterilisation <b>time-temperature</b> <b>integrator</b> (TTI) from the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus furiosus α-amylase is investigated. Reliability and accuracy of the TTIs was determined by exposure to various isothermal and non-isothermal industrially relevant temperature profiles. The integrated temperature history obtained by the TTIs correlated generally well with the data obtained from thermocouples installed, although the error increased with hold time of heat treatment. The work showed that the TTIs can be used reliably over a range (3 - 25 minutes at 121 °C) which is relevant for conditions of thermal sterilisation. This was measured by developing a new assay technique for assaying the activity of hyperthermophilic α-amylase within the food industry. The assay was calibrated against more laboratory relevant assays and computational models. The kinetics and mechanism of thermal denaturation of Pyrococcus furiosus α-amylase was determined through FT-IR, DSC and CD techniques.

All the enzymes followed 1 st-order inactiva-tion kinetics for both conventional and ohmic heating treatments. The presence of an electric field does not cause an enhanced inactivation to alkaline phosphatase, pectinase, and - galactosidase.

The TTIs are based on the first order thermal degradation of bacterial α-amylases. Two new TTIs are described, one for mild pasteurisation treatments of a few minutes at 70 °C and one for full sterilisation of > 3 minutes at 121. 1 °C. Examples are given of how these TTIs are applied to a variety of industrial thermal processes. These include traditional methods such as canning, but also more complex systems such as tubular heat exchangers and batch vessels, together with novel systems such as ohmic heating. Some of the industrial experiments dealt with processes in which the thermal effects had not been previously quantified. For sterilisation, a highly innovative solution is required. A candidate TTI material is identified based on an amylase secreted by the hyperthermophilic microorganism Pyrococcus furiosus. This microorganism exists in extreme conditions where it metabolises in boiling volcanic pools; with elemental sulphur readily available, in water of high salinity, and in a reducing atmosphere.

Here we experimentally demonstrate the working principle of a new kind of nanothermometer using materials with thermal memory as <b>time-temperature</b> <b>integrators.</b> As an application, we tackle the outstanding problem of spatially resolving a brusque erratic heating event in an operating microelectronic device. We show that a spatially and temporally confined temperature change leads to a local (reversible) modulation of the optical properties of our material. Thanks to the virtually infinite lifetime of the metastable states within the bistability region, this optical information can be retrieved later on by a simple reflectivity measurement, either in far-or near-field. This concept enabled us to acquire sub-wavelength resolution images of transient (s scale) heating events. The recent tendency of miniaturization and achievements in nanoscience and nanotechnology brought about the necessity of accurate temperature measurements on a reduced size scale [1 - 4]. In addition, the heat exchange in tiny volumes occurs promptly, hence the measurement needs to be done most often in a limited time window.

This target required the study of enzyme inactivation kinetics and of possible ways to manipule them for achieving such purposes. The main objective {{of this work}} therefore became a systematic study of enzyme heat inactivation and the use of controlled environmental characteristics for its manipulation. The thermal inactivation characteristics of dried horseradish peroxidase and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens #alpha#-amylase were studied as a function of water content and the hydrophobicity of three different organic solvents (dodecane, octane and octanol). The statistical aspects involved in the data analysis were carefully considered. Two different kinetics models (Bigelow, with 140 degC reference temperature and Arrhenius, with infinite reference temperature) and two regression methods (one-step or global analysis and two-step or individual analysis) were used. The two enzymes showed a much higher stability in these environments compared to aqueous solutions. The z values of both enzymes changed with water content and the organic solvent used, and the lowest values for this parameter occured for the higher water contents. For peroxidase in air, a maximum of the z value was found at a water content corresponding to equilibration at a water activity of 0. 76. In the case of amylase in air the variation of the z value with water content appeared to be very small or even negligible. In the organic solvents a variation similar to that in air was observed, although to a lesser extent. The stability is greatly decreased by the use of very hydrophilic organic solvents and high water contents in the organic solvent-enzyme suspension [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
