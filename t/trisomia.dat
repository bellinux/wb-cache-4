40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a case study}} about family {{autosome}} translocation is presented. On {{the basis of the}} evidence of chromosome`s abnormalities at the on parent (it was proved that the father has translocation between acrocentric chromosomes 13 and 14 or well known as Robertson’s or centric fusion’s) it was discovered that predisposition for nondisjunction could be expected. This is precondition for hereditary abnormality or for trisomia`s child to be born. These well-known facts are based on the proven risks for born of the children with <b>trisomia</b> because of the evidences that the bearers of the translocations have not any possibilities for child-bird of healthy descendants, nor descendants with balanced homological translocations, that were proved in our researched case...|$|E
40|$|El seguimiento fetal no invasivo mediante imagenología ha venido creciendo en los últimos treinta años. Con estos estudios se detectan problemas futuros con el fin de prevenirlos. Este artículo presenta un {{software}} que mediante imágenes de ultrasonido permite detectar la zona de translucencia nucal. Dicha zona es importante para la detección de <b>trisomía</b> 21 o síndrome de Down. Para ello el software contiene técnicas de operaciones morfológicas y la transformada Watershed. Adicionalmente, se desarrolló una plataforma web que permite el acceso al software de forma remota. Finalmente se demuestra la detección de la zona mediante la transformada Watershed. Fetal monitoring using noninvasive imaging {{has been}} developing over the last thirty years. These studies enable future problems to be detected and prevented. This paper presents a software that uses ultrasound imaging to detect the nuchal translucency area. This area {{is important for the}} detection of trisomy 21 or Down syndrome. For this, the software implements techniques of morphological operations and the Watershed transformation. Additionally, a web platform that allows remote access to the software was developed. Finally, the detection of the area is demonstrated using the Watershed transformation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the incidence of neonatal deafness and how effective screening could be in a cohort of infants under the national health service in Mestre Venice. The criteria used in the screening of a population at risk were those established by the JCIH (1990). All the children born between September 1992 and August 1995 (4408 infants) were examined in an attempt to identify risk factors. The children presenting one or more risk factors and those admitted to neonatal intensive care for any reason were submitted to ABR testing. The results were considered negative if the wave V was perceived at an intensity < or = 40 dB nHL. Of the 4408 children screened, a total of 5 were found with a degree of deafness in excess of 50 dB HL. Three children were found to be at risk while two had a silent history. In terms of etiology, 2 children showed genetic transmission, one there had a 21 <b>trisomia</b> while it proved impossible to determine the cause of deafness in the remaining two. As indicated in other studies, application of a risk register makes it possible to identify congenital deafness in 50 - 60 % of the cases. For this reason the authors consider mass screening through the use of oto-acoustic emissions to be quite useful...|$|E
40|$|Recientemente se ha publicado que las células trisómicas presentan una mayor sensibilidad al daño oxidativo, que podría justificar la frecuente asociación de síndrome de Down a aterosclerosis, envejecimiento precoz, etc. Para conocer el posible papel de la actividad física moderada en la mejora de la capacidad antioxidante se estudió {{el comportamiento}} de la enzima glucosa- 6 -fosfato-deshidrogenasa (G 6 PDH) eritrocitaria en 31 adolescentes varones (16. 3 ± 1. 1 años) tras desarrollar un programa de 12 semanas con tres sesiones (45 - 60 minutos) y una intensidad del 60 - 75 % frecuencia cardíaca máxima teórica. Nuestros resultados indican una mayor actividad de G 6 PDH en individuos con síndrome de Down cuando se compara con controles sin <b>trisomía</b> ajustados a su sexo, edad e índice de masa corporal. Asimismo observamos un incremento significativo de su actividad tras completar nuestro programa de 12 semanas. Podemos concluir que la actividad física moderada mejora la capacidad antioxidante en jóvenes con síndrome de Down. In recent {{years it has}} been claimed that {{trisomic}} cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress since there is an imbalance in the hydrogen peroxide metabolism. We designed the present study to assess the activity level of antioxidant enzyme glucose- 6 -phosphate-dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) of erythrocytes in 31 male adolescents with Down syndrome (mean age 16. 3 ± 1. 1) after performing a 12 week aerobic training program. First of all, a significant increase of 14. 9 % in the catalytic activity of G 6 PDH was observed in male adolescents with Down syndrome when compared with age, sex and body mass-matched controls without trisomy. After 12 -wk program its activity increased significantly compared to baseline value in Down syndrome individuals. Our data are consistent with previous evidence {{of the existence of}} higher oxidative stress in adolescents with Down syndrome when compared to the general population. We may also conclude that G 6 PDH activity was significantly increased after a 12 week exercise program...|$|E
