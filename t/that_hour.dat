25|$|Prior to CTV's {{purchase}} of the station in 2001, this shifting of primetime programming normally extended to the 7:00 ET / 6:00 CT hour on Sundays, {{in line with the}} practice of American broadcast networks. This meant a local newscast would air at 5:30, followed by primetime, then an extra local newscast at 10:00 p.m. Since 2001, CKY has usually aired local news at 6:00 seven nights a week, including Sundays, regardless of the station's ability to simsub at <b>that</b> <b>hour,</b> with programming rescheduled as needed to air within the 7-11 p.m. CT block.|$|E

25|$|On Sun News's {{first night}} of {{programming}} on April 18, 2011, 37,000 viewers nationwide tuned into the half-hour preview show, with 31,000 viewers staying to watch the first regular program, The Source with Ezra Levant; other first-day viewership levels included 31,000 for Charles Adler and 17,000 for Byline with Brian Lilley. After that first night, however, first-week viewership fell considerably, with the network attracting 12,000 viewers on April 20, only 1,000 of them within the advertiser-desired 25-54 age demographic.

25|$|On {{the night}} of 22 March, MacDonald's troops silently left their {{blocking}} position opposite Arcis-sur-Aube and marched through Dosnon and Sommesous toward Vitry-le-François. Amey was supposed to guard the artillery park, but by a misunderstanding, that general marched his division northwest to Sézanne. Consequently, the Russian Guard Light Cavalry Division attacked the unguarded wagon train, carrying off 15 artillery pieces and 300 prisoners while destroying the gunpowder and spiking 12 cannons. Coming on the scene, Gérard's corps rescued {{what was left of}} MacDonald's artillery park. Despite constant skirmishing with Karl Philipp von Wrede's Allied corps during the day, MacDonald got his troops safely across the Marne late on 23 March.
