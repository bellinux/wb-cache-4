40|$|Calls for {{accountability}} in America's schools have created increased responsibilities for educational leaders. In this article, we describe and discuss {{a study of}} elementary, middle, and high school principals' perceptions of the state-wide educational accountability program in North Carolina. The respondents indicated that the state's accountability program has had its greatest impact on how they monitored student achievement, aligned the curriculum to the testing program, provided student remedial or tutorial opportunities, assigned teachers to grades levels or subjects, and protected instructional time. Views of some components, such as measures of school effectiveness, school safety standards, expectations and promotion standards for students, and financial bonuses received by staff members in schools that meet expected achievement standards, were viewed favorably. In contrast, the No Child Left Behind Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) requirement (incorporated into the state's accountability program), testing requirements for Limited English Proficiency students and special education students, <b>the</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>applied</b> to schools that do not meet expected growth, and the school status designation labels that are applied to schools based upon student achievement were perceived more negatively.

40|$|Diante da crescente utilização dos termos “crime de ódio” e “discurso de ódio” na doutrina e na jurisprudência pátrias, e diante mesmo da possibilidade de sua inclusão formal no ordenamento brasileiro, este trabalho visa a explicitar o conceito dos termos, fixando seus traços distintivos e as peculiaridades no que tange às sanções aplicadas. Por meio de pesquisa legislativa, doutrinária e jurisprudencial, pôde-se concluir que os crimes de ódio devem ser entendidos como crimes politicamente motivados, intrinsecamente conectados ao contexto político-social em que tipificados e perpetrados. Ainda, por meio de análise comparada dos crimes de racismo e de injúria qualificada pelo preconceito racial, percebeu-se que o ordenamento jurídico pátrio abarca, em certa medida, tal compreensão dos crimes de ódio, atribuindo sanções mais gravosas ao crime de racismo.

For this purpose the author considered {{the essence of the}} institute of financial liability, analyzed financial liability of both the employee and the employer.

In order to investigate the peculiarities of financial liability of the employer the author considers the essence of the financial liability institution, analyzes the existing legislation and addresses the judicial practice. In particular, some cases of financial liability of the employer to the employee in labour relations are singled out, for example emergence of financial liability: a) in case of illegal dismissal from work; b) in case of illegal transfer to a different job; c) in case of illegal suspending from a job; d) in case of delay in giving back a service record book at dismissal; e) in case of delay in settling accounts at dismissal and others. The need to improve the labour legislation norms concerning the employer?s financial liability in the present labour legislation of Ukraine has been substantiated.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{discusses}} views {{and experiences of}} discipline and punishment in everyday schooling {{among a group of}} boys and girls aged between 14 and 16 years old, who are attending a public high school in an urban Andean city in Peru. It draws on data collected using a range of a qualitative methods, including in-depth interviews with students, their parents, teachers and headteacher; group discussions with students; and class-, school- and home-based observations. The findings suggest that punishment is the cornerstone of the disciplinary system within the school setting and therefore shapes social relationships between the different agents involved, including students, teachers and parents. The school environment defines students as actors who lack authority and voice; they are there to obey the rules imposed by the headteacher and teachers, and if these are not observed, students are penalised. The high school studied, far from presenting itself as a democratic institution, reproduces hierarchical relationships and ends up being fertile ground for the imposition of will through physical and verbal aggression, not only between teachers and students but also among the students. In this context, the paper highlights how the use of physical violence seems to be justifiable for children and for teachers, as a natural resource to deal with any situation of conflict. Negotiating is not part of school relationships; obeying is. Obedience is seen as a valuable lesson for students, by students themselves, the headteacher and teachers in the school education process. It is also noted that the school was understood as an institution that had the authority to discipline the students in its own way, even if they did not agree with <b>the</b> <b>sanctions</b> <b>applied.</b> The students don’t expect to live in an anarchic world – they demand rules and organisation, but don’t want rules to be unfair. There is no consensus in relationships inside the observed school and this only ends up generating transgressions and alternative forms of relationships: students learn how to ‘get around’ the system that has been imposed by paying the teachers for better grades 1, escaping from school, fighting, etc. As the paper shows, the main strategies of correction used in the school are associated with punishment, through verbal sanctions and often corporal punishment, including hitting students with sticks. These interactions take place despite the fact that physical correction is banned according to the school’s own regulations. In that sense, physical punishment practices are inflicted on a practical level but prohibited on a discursive level; leading to the school becoming a daily transgression space where the rules and coexistence are separated and not related and where masculinity seems to be associated with physical strength. © Young Lives 2011.

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} society should vary <b>the</b> <b>sanction</b> <b>applied</b> to a {{criminal}} defendant {{with the weight}} of the evidence against him or her.

The main result we reach is that all these approaches reduce the average undeclared share of output, but that deterrence and commitment policies also produce a negative effect on stationary output and employment.
