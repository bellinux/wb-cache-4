5|$|By May 1944, <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> {{had contributed}} to the war having given {{thousands}} of pints of blood to the Blood Banks; given money to the war relief campaigns; been active on the home front, and sent 808 {{men and women to}} the Armed Forces. There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home money to go towards the building fund. During the war, hundreds of dollars came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages the Parish {{church of}} Ystradyfodwg near {{the bank of}} the River Rhondda served <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> of the Rhondda Fawr, while the {{families}} of the Rhondda Fach attended Llanwynno church. The inhabitants of the lower Rhondda, in the vicinity of Porth and Dinas, would need to trek to Llantrisant to hear a service.|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of child maltreatment arguably {{began with the}} unusual case of Mary Ellen in 1874. When a New York parishioner went to visit a dying woman, the woman told about a child's screams for help that she could hear from another apartment. After some persuasion, <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> agreed to find help for the child. The police, local pastor, charitable agencies and the District Attorney all turned <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> away since <b>the</b> view {{at the time was}} that no one had the right to interfere in the private sphere of the family. It was not until <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> approached <b>the</b> American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), that help was forthcoming. <b>The</b> <b>parishioner</b> managed to convince the ASPCA that children should be afforded the same protections as animals. Subsequently, the ASPCA conducted an investigation of the treatment of Mary Ellen, uncovering evidence of both physical and emotional abuse as well as neglect. Mary Ellen was eventually removed from her foster parents and placed in the care of <b>the</b> helpful <b>parishioner...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} tale, a gluttonous friar tries to extract as many {{donations}} {{as possible from}} a bedridden <b>parishioner.</b> <b>The</b> <b>parishioner</b> then offers him his most valuable possession, provided he promises to distribute it equally among all <b>the</b> friars. <b>The</b> <b>parishioner</b> claims that this possession is located beneath his buttocks. When the friar reaches down to retrieve the item, the bedridden man farts into his hands. That night, an angel visits the friar and brings him to hell, where Satan expells hundreds of corrupt friars from his rectum.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{congregation}} provides volunteer labour and donates funds {{for many of}} church's activities, including laundry work, library administration, flower arrangements, bell ringing, singing in the parish choir and hospitality for the Sister Freda mission. Furnishings for the chapel in the Sydney Hospital were provided by <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> during Carr Smith's time, when he became chaplain to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Egan and the {{trustees}} of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, {{with the goal}} of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by <b>the</b> <b>parishioners.</b> One man went to get a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E

It was the fulfillment of <b>the</b> <b>parishioner’s</b> long desire for a Catholic School.|$|R
2500|$|On March 20, 1986, a parishioner of Community Chapel {{and wife}} of a teacher {{in the high school}} drove to a Motel in Portland, Oregon and drowned her 5-year-old {{daughter}} in a bathtub, allegedly to save her from demons. A short time later <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> entered a plea of [...] "not guilty for reasons of insanity" [...] to the crime. On April 16, 1986 Judge R. William Riggs found that the member was affected by mental disease or defect at the time of engaging in the criminal conduct, and ordered the member be committed to Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Psychiatric Hospital in Towson, Maryland. On July 26, 1991, <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> was discharged from the hospital when it was believed they no longer continued to present a substantial danger to others.|$|R
5|$|Temporarily {{transferred}} to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not {{large enough to accommodate}} all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by <b>the</b> <b>parishioners,</b> a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum {{consists}} of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching {{on each of}} the texts used in the mass throughout the church calendar (Treharne 2000, p.273). As such, it is the first new homily cycle in English since the works of Ælfric of Eynsham (c. 990). The motivation was to provide an accessible English text {{for the benefit of the}} less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the Vulgate, and <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all (Treharne 2000, p.273).|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} shared for worship between the monks of Dunster Priory and <b>the</b> <b>parishioners,</b> however {{this led to}} several {{conflicts}} between them. One outcome was the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east. It was restored in 1875–77 by George Edmund Street. The church has a cruciform plan with a central four-stage tower, built in 1443 with diagonal buttresses, a stair turret and single bell-chamber windows.|$|E
50|$|In Scientology, an auditor uses an E-meter (a {{galvanic}} skin response detector) {{to locate}} engrams in <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> which are then erased, using Dianetics. Scientology promotes such treatments to clear engrams believed to limit the individual's spiritual ability, to halt the decline of his spiritual awareness, and to increase his survival potential.|$|R

5|$|The east {{window is}} a {{memorial}} to Mrs Rosa Edwyna Powell (died 1860), of Nanteos, and her daughter Harriet Edwyna (died 1857), and was inserted by direction of the Will of her son George (died 1882). It depicts the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other stained glass windows, including the three western lancets, filled with stained glass by <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> in 1894, {{in memory of the}} Reverend John Pugh, curate 1856–1861 and vicar 1861–1893.|$|E
5|$|The {{pastor of}} Mt. St. Peter Parish is {{appointed}} to the position by the Bishop and {{is the leader of}} the parish. When one steps down, is transferred to another church, passes away, or retires, another is appointed. He is in charge of making sure that everything goes smoothly with the priests and administration of the church. The pastor works in collaboration with the Parish Staff, the Parish Pastoral Council, and the Parish Finance Council. His mission is to proclaim and help facilitate the building of the Kingdom of God among <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> of Mt. St. Peter Church.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984 a {{group of}} parishioners {{reported}} to archbishop, Juan Francisco Fresno, later cardinal, about Father Karadima's [...] "improper conduct." [...] The letter was [...] "torn up and thrown away," [...] according to a court statement by <b>the</b> <b>parishioner.</b> In those days, Karadima had managed to install {{one of his own}} as the Cardinal's secretary. This priest was Juan Barros Madrid.|$|R
5000|$|This {{technique}} {{attempts to}} reveal the ideological superstructure of a society {{in the form of}} its rituals. [...] "Rituals" [...] in this sense describes the patterns of human relationships and the masks of behaviour that those patterns impose on the participants according to the roles that they play in society. For example: a man goes to a priest to confess his sins; despite the individual identities of the man and priest (i.e. the priest and <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> are landlords, <b>the</b> priest is a landlord and <b>the</b> <b>parishioner</b> is a peasant, etc.) the pattern of behavior will remain the same as other examples of this interaction. This will cause different scenarios to play out even though the confession is the same. Boal argues that this is an extraordinarily rich technique that has many variants: for example, the same ritual may be explored by its participants exchanging masks or it may be enacted by people from different social classes.|$|R
5|$|By 1900, {{the burgeoning}} {{industrial}} town had 4,600 residents {{and two years}} later Reverend Bonaventure Piscopo, a member of the Apostolic Band for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, formed a new congregation in New Kensington to serve the immigrant work force, many of whom were Italian Catholics. The church was named after Saint Peter, the first pope. <b>The</b> <b>parishioners</b> of this new congregation were Italians living in and around New Kensington, Arnold, and Parnassus, which later became a part of the city of New Kensington. These immigrants needed a place to worship and in 1903, the St. Peter congregation began holding Mass with a resident pastor, Reverend Vincenzo Maselli in a small building on the corner of Second Avenue and Tenth Street (known as the downtown area) in New Kensington.|$|E
5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained glass that had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E
5|$|The second {{break from}} the kirk was also {{prompted}} by issues of patronage. Minister Thomas Gillespie (1708–74) was deposed by the General Assembly in 1752 after he refused to participate in inducting a minister to the Inverkeithing parish, since <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> opposed the appointment. Gillespie was joined by two other ministers and they held {{the first meeting of}} the Presbytery of Relief at Colinsburgh in Fife in 1761. While evangelical in doctrine, the Relief Church did not maintain that it was the only true church, but stated that it was still in communion with the kirk and maintained contact with Episcopalians and Independents. Like the Associate Presbytery, the movement was initially small, but benefited from the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century, which helped it expand rapidly.|$|E

5|$|In 1766 John Egerton, Bishop of Bangor, {{appointed}} {{an elderly}} English priest, Dr Thomas Bowles, to the parish of St Beuno, Trefdraeth and its chapelry of St Cwyfan, Llangwyfan. Between them the parish and chapelry had about 500 parishioners, of whom all but five spoke only Welsh, whereas Bowles spoke only English. <b>The</b> <b>parishioners</b> and churchwardens of Trefdraeth petitioned against Bowles's appointment, {{arguing that the}} appointment of a priest who did not speak Welsh breached the Articles of Religion, the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures into Welsh 1563 and the Act of Uniformity 1662. In 1773 the Court of Arches ruled that only clergy who could speak Welsh should be appointed to Welsh-speaking parishes, and Bowles should not have been appointed, but he now held the ecclesiastical freehold of the benefice and the case to deprive him of it had not been proved. The court therefore let Bowles stay in post, which he did until he died in November of that year. Bowles was then replaced in the parish and chapelry with Richard Griffith, a priest who spoke Welsh.|$|E
5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for <b>the</b> <b>parishioners</b> of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

50|$|In 1902, {{the bishop}} of Medellín, Joaquín Pardo Vergara, created the St Julian vice-parish (Viceparroquia de san Julián), which had {{approximately}} 3,000 inhabitants, and a simple straw chapel. That chapel was built by the Sonsón's priest, Daniel Florencio Sánchez, with <b>the</b> <b>parishioner’s</b> help. On June 26 of the same year, Juan Manuel Contreras is appointed as vice-parson. Like others, the St Julian vice-parish was created {{as a part of}} the parish of Sonsón.|$|R
