5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E
2500|$|Kricfalusi {{complained about}} Nickelodeon {{executives}} requesting that Ren have [...] "a softer side". Bill Wray said that Ren {{was his favorite}} character to write for; Wray described Ren as [...] "fun" [...] because [...] "you can make him mean." [...] In 1993 he added that [...] "It drives me crazy when I tell people I work {{on the show and}} <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'Make Ren meaner.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January, Tunney competed at the London Prepares series {{where she}} placed nineteenth all {{around with a}} score of 54.399. [...] Also, she placed sixth in the uneven bars event finals with a score of 14.266. [...] Tunney said, [...] "The {{atmosphere}} at the test event was really good. The reactions you got from the home crowd after routines were incredible. My mum went to the test event, and my grandma and grandpa went. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> they're proud but I don't take it in – it's just me doing gymnastics. They obviously see {{it in a different}} way, as a major thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, it's no use {{talking about}} it now,' said Sam. 'It's over, and can't be helped, and that's one consolation, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>says</b> in Turkey, ven they cuts the wrong man's head off. It's my innings now, gov'nor, {{and as soon as}} I catches hold o' this 'ere Trotter, I'll have a good 'un.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No doubt, no doubt. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> are,” <b>says</b> my lord. “No doubt, {{when she}} heard he was killed, she fainted from accident.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{incident}} Mitchell said, [...] "It is {{our job to}} ask. <b>They</b> can <b>always</b> <b>say</b> 'no comment'… but to drag a reporter out just for asking is inexcusable behavior." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We want to {{add value}} through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we have {{found out that the}} main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E
2500|$|US and India {{continue}} to differ on {{issues ranging from}} trade to civil liberties. The Indian Home Ministry, through an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court on 13 February 2015, claimed that Country Reports on Rights & Practices have become instruments of foreign policy: [...] "The US, UK and EU have clearly mentioned in government documents and pronouncements that these reports are made {{for the purpose of}} their being used as instruments of foreign policy." [...] The affidavit also claimed that the reports by US, UK and European Parliament were biased since they [...] "do not provide opportunity to the Government of India or the local embassy/high commission to record their opinion and are heavily biased against the targeted country". The 2014 State Department’s annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report appeared to classify the Khobragade incident as an example of human trafficking, stating: [...] "An Indian consular officer at the New York consulate was indicted in December 2013 for visa fraud related to her alleged exploitation of an Indian domestic worker." [...] In response, India has shown no urgency to allow visits to India by the newly appointed US anti-people trafficking ambassador Susan P. Coppedge and the US special envoy for LGBT rights Randy Berry. Under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code homosexuality is illegal in India. Indian Ambassador to the USA, Arun K.Singh reiterated India's commitment to work within an international framework to tackle the problem of trafficking but rejected any [...] "unilateral assessments" [...] by another country saying [...] "We will never accept it" [...] and downplayed the importance of the visits: [...] "When you ask a U.S. official when somebody will be given a visa, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> ‘we will assess when visa is applied for.’ ... I can do no better than to reiterate the U.S. position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's what <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say.</b> But all the frankness can't be well meant. Why should uncandor be {{the only}} form of malevolence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> are," [...] <b>says</b> my lord. [...] "No doubt, {{when she}} heard he was killed, she fainted from accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes; it is better. If {{people are}} honest <b>they</b> had <b>always</b> better <b>say</b> to each other's faces that {{which they have}} to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{told her}} of the {{founding}} of his Home and of the good it had done. [...] "You are the very person," [...] he resumed, [...] "to be the good sister-friend that I want for my poor girls: you can say for them what <b>they</b> cannot <b>always</b> <b>say</b> to me for themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the voices}} of the air! Oh, from no one else; I never let other people speak of you. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> you're 'charming,' and that's so flat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “When {{people talk}} about Miguel Zaloa, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> he is good man. I hear Meest Weldon say: ‘Miguel is honest. I would trust Miguel with all I have.’” ...|$|E
6000|$|Phineas had {{received}} a letter from the Stamford surgeon, and was able to report favourably of Lord Chiltern. [...] "The man says that he had better not be moved for a month," [...] said Phineas. [...] "But that means nothing. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> that." ...|$|E
60|$|Wasn't it Shakespeare or {{somebody}} {{who said that}} the road to Hell--or words to that effect--was paved with good intentions? If it was Shakespeare, it just goes to prove what <b>they</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> about him--that he knew a bit. Take it from one who knows, the old boy was absolutely right.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Still, <b>they</b> {{certainly}} do <b>always</b> <b>say</b> it. I never minded the barriers; {{but there was}} always a slight shock about the other, unless one was very hard hit indeed.|$|R
6000|$|The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia {{cemetery}} {{were occupied}} by murdered men. So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so <b>they</b> will <b>always</b> <b>say</b> and believe. The reason {{why there was}} so much slaughtering done, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates, and a person is not respected until he has [...] "killed his man." [...] That was the very expression used.|$|R
6000|$|All {{the male}} {{visitors}} {{are expected to}} kiss the stage servant-girl when they come into the house, and to dig her in the ribs and to say: [...] "Do you know, Jane, I think you're an uncommonly nice girl--click." [...] <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> this, and she likes it.|$|E
60|$|I {{once wrote}} a play which I read to a {{distinguished}} Manager. He {{said it was}} a most interesting play: <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> that. I waited, wondering to what other manager he would recommend me to take it. To my surprise he told me he would like it for himself--but with alterations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Come, now, Ned; {{you know}} as well as I do that that is one of the stalest commonplaces going. If a fellow knows how to box, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> he has science but no pluck. If he doesn't know his right hand from his left, they say that he isn't clever but that he is full of game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, mother, it's me. A bad shilling, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>always</b> turns up. I always turn up, {{therefore}} I am a bad shilling! Sound logic that, eh, May?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Chief Inspector Lestrade - Lestrade is a bumbling and {{sometimes}} incompetent inspector for Scotland Yard. Whenever he crosses paths with Orson and Olivia, he usually {{does not pay}} attention to what <b>they</b> tell him, <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> that he has the investigation under control.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} should; of course <b>they</b> should. I <b>always</b> <b>say</b> to my gents, 'Be punctual, and I'll do {{anything}} for you.' But, perhaps, Mr. Finn, you can hand me a cheque for this amount, and then you and I will begin square." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the {{way with}} them always. They do all our work for us,--sailing either on one tack or the other. That is their use in creation, that when we split among ourselves, as we always do, {{they come in and}} finish our job for us. It must be {{unpleasant}} for them to be always doing that which <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> should never be done at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{is a very}} {{inconvenient}} {{habit of}} kittens (Alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. 'If they would only purr for [...] "yes" [...] and mew for [...] "no," [...] or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk with a person if <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> the same thing?' ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the people}} came {{crowding}} round to peep at it, and declared {{it was the}} most beautiful baby that ever was seen. Of course that is what <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> but this time it happened to be true. And every day the boy grew bigger and stronger till he was twelve years old, when the king died, and he was left alone {{to take care of his}} mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{well aware}} that I do not express myself with exactability. Ladies and gentlemen have that power over words that <b>they</b> can <b>always</b> <b>say</b> what <b>they</b> mean, but a common man like me can't. Words don't come natural to him. He has more {{thoughts}} than words, and what words he has don't fit his thoughts. Might I take a turn with the roller, and make myself useful about the place until nightfall, for ninepence?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Breaking The Rules": [...] "Its {{like when}} {{somebody}} says you cant do that, {{at school or}} whatever. <b>They</b> were <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> that to me at school. You do it anyhow." [...] Brian Johnson: [...] "But {{at the same time}} it says dont start any fooking revolutions, dont be a big fooking hero, just break the rules in your own way. Dont just do what the man says and go aye, okay. Do it the way you wanted to." ...|$|R
60|$|JULIA (firing up). If he {{has nothing}} worse than that on his conscience, he may sleep pretty well. In what way am I more womanly {{than any of the}} rest of them, I should like to know? <b>They</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> things like that behind my back--I hear of them from Sylvia. Only the other day a member of the {{committee}} said I ought never to have been elected--that you (to Charteris) had smuggled me in. I should like to see her say it to my face: that's all.|$|R
60|$|Never mind, I can wait. From {{eight to}} eleven is only three hours, anyway. I will move about here {{and look at}} things. If I keep moving they will notice me less. Ha! books and news papers and magazines--what a stack of them! Like a regular book-store. I will stand here {{and take a look}} at some of them. Eh! what's that? Did I want to buy anything? Well, no, I hadn't exactly--I was just--Oh, I see, they're on sale. All right, yes, give me this one--fifty cents--all right--and this and these others. That's all right, miss, I'm not stingy. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> of me up in our town that when I--She has stopped listening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] {{answered}} Inglewood, [...] "I'm afraid I've {{lost touch}} with my old friends. The greatest friend I ever had was at school, a fellow named Smith. It's odd you should mention it, because I was thinking of him to-day, though I haven't seen him for seven or eight years. He was on the science side with me at school-- a clever fellow though queer; and {{he went up to}} Oxford when I went to Germany. The fact is, it's rather a sad story. I often asked him to come and see me, and when I heard nothing I made inquiries, you know. I was shocked to learn that poor Smith had gone off his head. The accounts were a bit cloudy, of course, some saying that he had recovered again; but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> that. About a year ago I got a telegram from him myself. The telegram, I'm sorry to say, put the matter beyond a doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Much {{the same}} as usual, Mr. Walters--Herbert, I mean,' Selah answered, hastily {{correcting}} herself. 'The regular round. Prayers; clean the shop; breakfast, with a chapter; serve in the shop all morning; dinner, with a chapter; serve in the shop all afternoon; tea, with a chapter; prayer meeting in the evening; supper, with a chapter; exhortation; and go to bed, sick of it all, to get up next morning and repeat the entire performance da capo, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> in the music to the hymn-books. Occasional relaxations,--Sunday at chapel three times, and Wednesday evening Bible class; mothers' assembly, Dorcas society, missionary meeting, lecture on the Holy Land, dissolving views of Jerusalem, and Primitive Methodist district conference in the Mahanaim Jubilee meeting hall. Salvation privileges every day and all the year round, till I'm ready to drop with it, and begin to wish I'd only been {{lucky enough to have}} been born one of those happy benighted little pagans in a heathen land where they don't know the value of the precious Sabbath, and haven't yet been taught to build Primitive Methodist district chapels for crushing the lives out of their sons and daughters!' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{thing that}} is {{positive}} to me {{may not necessarily be}} positive to you. If the police mistreated me I could curse to ease my tension after having been disturbed by a policeman. If I say that in rhyme, in a poetic way, not necessarily the radio announcer should say this is positive or not. <b>They</b> can <b>always</b> <b>say</b> it's negative to their opinion, cause everybody has a right to their own opinion. In hip hop I can express my views by giving you a challenge, so you come to me the next day and say: What do you mean when you say that?" [...] http://www.musikmuseet.se/mmm/africa/ku.html ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P.S.--I am {{like your}} sex, who <b>always,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> put their chief {{news in a}} poscrip. I had {{something}} to tell you about a person to whom my heart is engaged. I shall write more about it, which there is no hurry. Safice she is a nobleman's daughter, and her family as good as our own." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is indeed}} their feeble boast {{that they are}} not {{literally}} illiterate. <b>They</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> the ancient barons could not sign their own names--for they know less of history perhaps than of anything else. The modern barons, however, can sign their own names--or someone else's for a change. They can sign their own names; and that is about all they can do. They cannot face a fact, or follow an argument, or feel a tradition; but, least of all, can they, upon any persuasion, read through a plain impartial book, English or foreign, that is not specially written to soothe their panic or to please their pride. Looking up at these seats of the mighty I can only say, with something of despair, what Robert Lowe said of the enfranchised workmen: [...] "We must educate our masters." ...|$|R
