40|$|AbstractIn the paper, two {{tools are}} used for {{estimation}} of second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> for gases and the obtained results are compared with the experimental data. The first tool is the computer program for estimation of second and <b>third</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> for gases and gas mixtures from basic properties of components. The computer program incorporates two empirical methods, the Tsonopoulos method to estimate second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> for nonpolar to polar pure gases and gas mixtures, and the method of Orbey and Vera to estimate <b>third</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> for nonpolar pure gases and gas mixtures. The second tool is the artificial neural network model (ANN) for correlation and prediction of second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> for gases. The neural network model was developed with the training variables: critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume, acentric factor, dipole moment and temperature with the learning method back propagation of errors according to the best prediction error. The target variable was the second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> of gas. The neural network model has architecture (6, 10, 4, 1). The training error was 0. 3 %. The network predicts the second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> with the average prediction error of 1. 3 %.
