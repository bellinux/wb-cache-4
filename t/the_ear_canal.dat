5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> The tragus protrudes and partially obscures <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region in front of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is called the concha. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The {{first part of the}} canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Earwax {{is partly}} {{composed}} of sebum produced by glands in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> These secretions are viscous {{and have a}} high lipid content, which provides good lubrication.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
50|$|Earwax, {{also known}} as cerumen, is a yellowish, waxy {{substance}} secreted in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> It {{plays an important role}} in <b>the</b> human <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> assisting in cleaning and lubrication, and also provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, and insects. Excess or impacted cerumen can press against the eardrum and/or occlude the external auditory canal and impair hearing, causing conductive hearing loss.|$|R
40|$|A {{five year}} old female spayed Cocker Spaniel {{presented}} {{with a history of}} chronic otitis externa. Initial diagnostics revealed bilateral stenotic and calcified <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> Because <b>the</b> right <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> was slightly more stenotic than the left, <b>the</b> total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) was performed on <b>the</b> right <b>ear</b> first. <b>The</b> animal recovered well from the procedure. Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of <b>the</b> externa <b>ear,</b> and {{it is one of the}} most common diseases seen in small animal practice. The causes of otitis externa are numerous and often categorized into predisposing factors, primary causes, secondard causes, and perpetuating factors. For chronic otitis externa cases that respond poorly to medical therapy or neoplasia within <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> surgical treatment may be accomplished via lateral <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resection, vertical canal ablation, or total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation. Total <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ablation is warranted to patients with end-stage chronic otitis externa non-responsive to medical treatment, failed lateral or vertical <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> resection, neoplasia within horizontal <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and stenotic/calcified <b>ear</b> <b>canals...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{superior}} vestibular nucleus, {{one of four}} vestibular nuclei, {{is located}} within the pons.

5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges {{on the inner}} surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
50|$|Earwax {{consists}} of shed skin cells, hair, and the secretions of the ceruminous and sebaceous glands of <b>the</b> outside <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Major components of earwax are long chain fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, alcohols, squalene, and cholesterol. Excess or compacted cerumen can press against the eardrum or block <b>the</b> outside <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> or hearing aids, potentially causing hearing loss.|$|R

5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. <b>The</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
50|$|Specialized sweat glands, {{including}} the ceruminous glands, mammary glands, ciliary glands of the eyelids, and sweat glands {{of the nasal}} vestibulum, are modified apocrine glands. Ceruminous glands are near <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> and produce cerumen (earwax) that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous glands. Mammary glands use apocrine secretion to produce milk.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{equivalent}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume {{ranges from}} 0. 3 ml to 1. 0 ml {{in children and}} from 0. 65 to 1. 75 ml in adults. In subjects with chronic otitis media these values can be different, according to the disease status. Aim: To study <b>the</b> equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume in 52 ears of patients with chronic otitis media with and without active infection. Study design: clinical prospective with transversal cohort. Material and Method: <b>The</b> equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume was obtained from 52 ears diagnosed with chronic otitis media with and without active infection and in age and gender matched control group. The study group with active infection was evaluated before and after clinical treatment. Results: Equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean for the studied groups with and without infection and {{for the control group}} was 2. 86 ml; 1. 42 ml and 0. 80 ml, respectively. <b>The</b> equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean for the study group with infection prior and post clinical treatment was 1. 42 ml and 1. 82 ml, respectively. Conclusions: <b>The</b> Equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume mean was higher in patients with Chronic Otitis Media. We did not observe variation of equivalent <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> volume before and after clinical treatment...|$|R
40|$|By {{using an}} {{experimental}} setup yielding the acoustical Two-Port properties of earplugs. the attenuation of three fundamentally {{different types of}} earplugs is predicted. The setup used is based on molds of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> of a real person, and the Two-Port of each earplug is numerically coupled to an acoustical model of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> predicted attenuation is compared to the subjective attenuation (REAT) measured on the same person. For one type of earplug the results are modified {{to compensate for the}} lack of resilience in <b>the</b> artificial <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> <b>The</b> results of repeated measurements are encouraging. Not only does the objective method yield attenuation data similar to the REAT, it also seems to reflect some of the variations given by subjective measurements...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal),</b> Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
25|$|Even without {{exposure}} to water, {{the use of}} objects such as cotton swabs or other small objects to clear <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is enough to cause breaks in the skin, and allow the condition to develop. Once the skin of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is inflamed, external otitis can be drastically enhanced by either scratching <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> with an object, or by allowing water to remain in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> for any prolonged length of time.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHuman {{temporal}} {{bones in}} teaching ear surgery are rare. The lamb's temporal bone {{might be a}} possible alternative. Material and Methods: Temporal bones of the lamb were dissected with a typical temporal bone lab drilling program. We included a mastoidectomy, endaural approaches, but also analyzed the outer appearance, <b>the</b> external <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and <b>the</b> hypotympanon. Some steps differed from preparation done in humans. The morphometric results were compared to the known anatomy of human in order to verify the lambs' temporal bone for suitability in otosurgic training. Results: The lambs' temporal bone appears smaller than the human one. We found a bullous extended hypotympanon located under <b>the</b> external <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> <b>The</b> tympanic membrane {{is very similar to}} the human one. <b>The</b> external <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is smaller and shorter. The ossicular chain shows analogies to human one. Discussion: This study shows, that especially <b>the</b> middle <b>ear,</b> <b>the</b> tympanic membrane and <b>the</b> external <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> are morphologically equal to the structures found in human temporal bones. The lamb seems feasible for teaching the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> smaller scales of some structures, especially the outer components of the temporal bone are a disadvantage. Conclusions: The lamb seems to be an alternative in teaching ear surgery...|$|R
50|$|Seen {{mostly in}} children, {{multifocal}} unisystem LCH {{is characterized by}} fever, bone lesions and diffuse eruptions, usually on the scalp and in <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> 50% of cases involve the pituitary stalk, leading to diabetes insipidus.

40|$|The continual {{exposure}} of outer hair cells (OHCs) to thermal noise causes vibrations in resonant frequency. As these vibrations are backprojected, {{they should be}} recordable as audiofrequencies in <b>the</b> outer <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> But {{even though they are}} likely to be amplified in some areas by clustering in terms of the chaos theory, they cannot be picked up in <b>the</b> outer <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> by currently available recording technologies. Conditions change in the presence of pathology, e. g. loss of OHCs and fibrous replacement: Clusters grow in size and amplitudes become larger so that the vibrations can be picked up as spontaneous oto-acoustic emissions (SOAEs) in <b>the</b> outer <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> Efforts are needed to demonstrate the presence of physiological OHC vibrations (emission by incessant vibration, EIV) by processing auditory recordings with statistical methods...|$|R
25|$|Effective {{solutions}} for <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination. When <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> skin is inflamed from the acute otitis externa, {{the use of}} dilute acetic acid may be painful.|$|E
25|$|Otitis externa, {{also called}} swimmer's ear, is {{inflammation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> It often presents with ear pain, swelling of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and occasionally decreased hearing.

2500|$|Necrotizing {{external}} otitis (malignant otitis externa) is {{an uncommon}} form of external otitis that occurs mainly in elderly diabetics, being somewhat more likely and more severe when the diabetes is poorly controlled. Even less commonly, it can develop {{due to a}} severely compromised immune system. Beginning as infection of <b>the</b> external <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> there {{is an extension of}} the infection into <b>the</b> bony <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> and <b>the</b> soft tissues deep to the bony canal.

25|$|The {{two factors}} that are {{required}} for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of germs that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in {{the integrity of the}} skin of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> that allow an infection to occur.
