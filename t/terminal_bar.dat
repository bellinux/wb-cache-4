It has a yellow-stained nape and crown. Its bill is large and pink; however, older birds will gain a blue tip. The juveniles are an all-over brown colour, and they will whiten as they mature, in about 10 to 20 years. It can be distinguished from the other two species of albatross in its range, the Laysan albatross and the black-footed albatross by its larger size and its pink bill (with a bluish tip), as well as details of its plumage. [...] Contrary to its name its tail is no shorter than that of the Laysan or black-footed, and is actually longer than that of the other member of the genus Phoebastria, the waved albatross.|$|E
60|$|The Nun is white, {{with the}} head, tail, and primary wing-feathers black; it is a breed which was {{established}} {{as long ago as}} the year 1600. I crossed a male Nun with a female red common Tumbler, which latter variety generally breeds true. Thus neither parent had a trace of blue in the plumage, or of bars on the wing and tail. I should premise that common Tumblers are rarely blue in England. From the above cross I reared several young: one was red over the whole back, but with the tail as blue as that of the rock-pigeon; the <b>terminal</b> <b>bar,</b> however, was absent, but the outer feathers were edged with white: a second and third nearly resembled the first, but the tail in both presented a trace of the bar at the end: a fourth was brownish, and the wings showed a trace of the double bar: a fifth was pale blue over the whole breast, back, croup, and tail, but the neck and primary wing-feathers were reddish; the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour; the tail was not barred, but the outer feathers were edged with white. I crossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of complicated descent, namely, from a black Barb, a Spot, and Almond-tumbler, so that the two young birds produced from this cross included the blood of five varieties, none of which had a trace of blue or of wing and tail-bars: one of the two young birds was brownish-black, with black wing-bars; the other was reddish-dun, with reddish wing-bars, paler {{than the rest of the}} body, with the croup pale blue, the tail bluish with a trace of the <b>terminal</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

60|$|I crossed {{two male}} black Barbs with two female red Spots. These latter {{have the whole}} body and wings white, with {{a spot on the}} forehead, the tail and tail-coverts red; the race existed at least as long ago as 1676, and now breeds {{perfectly}} true, as was known to be the case in the year 1735. (6/28. J. Moore 'Columbarium' 1735; in J.M. Eaton's edition 1852 page 71.) Barbs are uniformly-coloured birds, with rarely even a trace of bars on the wing or tail; they are known to breed very true. The mongrels thus raised were black or nearly black, or dark or pale brown, sometimes slightly piebald with white: of these birds no less than six presented double wing-bars; in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black; in seven some white feathers appeared on the croup; and in two or three there was a trace of the <b>terminal</b> <b>bar</b> to the tail, but in none were the outer tail-feathers edged with white.|$|E

40|$|The {{olfactory}} receptor cell {{is characterized}} by a distal process (the dendrite) which terminates in the olfactory passage as the olfactory rod. The olfactory rod is provided with numerous cilia which are similar in structure to those seen in other tissues. The central processes of the bipolar cell constitute the fila olfactoria. The cytoplasmic organelles of the sustentacular cell are concentrated at the apical and basal ends of the cell with a paucity of cytoplasmic elements in the region of the nucleus. The plasma membrane of the supporting cell forms a mesaxon for both the dendrite and axon of the bipolar cell. <b>Terminal</b> <b>bars</b> are present in the epithelial cells. The axons constituting the fila olfactoria form fascicles which are ensheathed by mesaxons of adjacent Schwann cells. Thus the olfactory neurons are ensheathed throughout their course by the membranes of sustentacular and Schwann cells.

40|$|The general fine {{structure}} of the atrial musculature of the turtle heart is described, including; {{the nature of the}} sarcolemma; the cross-banded {{structure of the}} myofibrils; the character of the sarcoplasm, and the form and disposition of its organelles. An abundant granular component of the sarcoplasm in this species is tentatively identified as a particulate form of glycogen. The myocardium is composed of individual cells joined end to end at primitive intercalated discs, and side to side at sites of cohesion that resemble the desmosomcs of epithelia. Transitional forms are found between desmosomes and intercalated discs. Both consist of a thickened area of the cell membrane with an accumulation of dense material in the subjacent cytoplasm. This dense amorphous component is often continuous with the Z substance of the myofibriis and may be of the same composition.

30|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, TJs were first {{identified}} as the physical barrier to dye diffusion at the apical surface of intestinal epithelium, dubbed the “terminal bar.” By the 1950 s, TJs were recognized as key components to the barriers of frog skin and other epithelial layers [8]. Since then, TJs have been established as the primary regulators of fluid and solutes flux, based on size and charge (termed permselectivity). Research in animal models has helped to define the contributions of specific TJ proteins to tissue permselectivity and their function in disease states through knockout or overexpression studies [9]. Recent work has elucidated their roles as signaling platforms that establish cell polarity, transmit signals into nuclei, and modulate gene expression [10]. TJs are also capable of transmitting signals into cell nuclei via recruitment of adapter proteins [11]. No longer viewed as simple <b>terminal</b> <b>bars,</b> TJs are now seen as complex “plaques” containing more than 40 proteins that mechanically link adjoining cells and regulate tension, permselectivity, as well as cell signaling and gene expression [12].|$|R
