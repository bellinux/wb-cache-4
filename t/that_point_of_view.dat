5000|$|Whereas propositional attitudes {{approach}} is to analyze <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> internally, the [...] "location/access" [...] approach analyzes <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> externally, by their role. The term [...] "access" [...] refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that [...] "points <b>of</b> <b>views,</b> or perspectives, are ways of having access {{to the world and}} to ourselves", and the term [...] "location" [...] is in reference to the provided quotation <b>of</b> Jon Moline <b>that</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> are [...] "ways <b>of</b> <b>viewing</b> things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion <b>that</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of [...] "location" [...] in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.|$|R

This is the first formal analysis of locatives in any Bantu language. The Mushunguli data motivate the claim <b>that</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> abstract entities consisting of a location and an orientation, are arguments of some spatial expressions. Incorporating such <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in analyses <b>of</b> the meanings of English spatial expressions is shown to improve their empirical predictions. ...|$|R
25|$|Netchain {{is a set}} of {{networks}} consisting of horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers. In practice, the phrase netchain is often used in a more general way referring to a system which has chain and network characteristics as well. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> the perspective is even more important than the object itself.|$|E
25|$|Yesün Temür's reign was short; his {{direct rule}} lasted {{only for a}} year after Dagi's death. But he was glorified in Chinese records since he and his father, aided by their sinicized Mongolian ministers and Chinese scholar-officials, had made {{vigorous}} efforts to transform further the Yuan along traditional Confucian lines. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Shidibala's assassination was sometimes explained as the struggle between the pro-Confucian faction and the opposite steppe elite faction, for Yesün Temür Khan had ruled Mongolia before succession and his policies appeared relatively unfavorable for Chinese officials.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{considered}} the Kresy territories (prewar eastern Poland) to be colonized by the Poles and the Red Army was proclaimed a liberator of the conquered nationalities. Many Jews, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians shared <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and {{cooperated with the}} new authorities in repressing the Poles. The Soviet administrators used slogans about class struggle and dictatorship of the proletariat, as they applied the policies of Stalinism and Sovietization in occupied eastern Poland. On 22 and 26 October 1939, the Soviets staged elections to Moscow-controlled Supreme Soviets (legislative bodies) of the newly created provinces of Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia to legitimize the Soviet rule. The new assemblies subsequently called for the incorporation into the Soviet Union, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union annexed the two territories to the already existing Soviet republics (the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) on 2 November.|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} structure <b>of</b> a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> may be analysed similarly {{to the concept}} of a propositional attitude. A propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a proposition. Examples of such attitudes are [...] "to believe in something", [...] "to desire something", [...] "to guess something", [...] "to remember something", etc. Vazques Campos and Gutierrez suggest <b>that</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> may be analyzed as structured sets of propositional attitudes.

25|$|This {{search for}} an {{identity}} resulted in giving emphasis to the Muisca culture and overlooking other native nations, which were seen as wild people. Researchers wrongly concluded that the Muisca culture inhabited a previously empty land and that all archeological finds could be attributed solely to the Muisca. In 1849 president Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera invited Italian cartographer Agustín Codazzi, who led the Geography Commission with Manuel Ancízar and did descriptive studies of the national territory and an inventory of the archaeological sites. The result of the expedition was published in Bogotá in 1889 as Peregrinación Alfa. Argüello García {{pointed out that the}} goal of that expedition {{in the context of the}} new nation was to underline the pre-Hispanic societies and in that sense they centered on the Muisca culture as the main model. A similar tendency can be found in the works of Ezequiel Uricoechea. An objection to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> came from Vicente Restrepo: his work Los chibchas antes de la conquista española showed them as barbarians.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

The site's [...] "Conservapedia Commandments" [...] differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies. Wikipedia's policies include following a neutral point of view and avoiding original research. In response to Wikipedia's core policy of neutrality, Schlafly has stated: [...] "It's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral. I mean let's take a point of view, let's disclose <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> to the reader", and [...] "Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators.

Another Labour backbencher, Jimmy Maxton, rose and asked the Prime Minister [...] "if he has read the article, {{and if he is}} aware that the article contains mainly a call to the troops not to allow themselves to be used in industrial disputes, and that <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is shared by a large number of Members sitting on these benches?"

For Glee second season, Murphy confirmed plans to cast a Christian character on the show, expressing desires to keep Glee a [...] "show about inclusiveness". In an interview with TV Guide, Murphy said on Christianity, [...] "If we're trying to form a world of inclusiveness, we've got to include <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> as well." [...] He predicted [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] {{would be the most}} controversial episode of the series to date, as it depicts the spiritual and emotional importance of God to the characters. Murphy aimed to address religion in a [...] "socially responsible" [...] way, and compared [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] to topical Norman Lear shows of the 1970s. He hoped to produce a balanced depiction of the subject matter, and he, along with co-writers Brennan and Falchuk, checked the script to ensure that for every anti-religious sentiment conveyed, there was a pro-religious one to counterbalance it. The episode references several religions apart from Christianity; Puck and Rachel are both Jewish, Kurt hires an acupuncturist who is a Sikh, and makes a reference to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
500|$|The FIA {{planned to}} [...] "put {{almost all of}} it into a {{charitable}} foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety", and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001. In addition, the FIA continued to receive an annual dividend from the deal, Mosley stated: [...] "Over the totality of the contract, and on an annual basis, the sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars. Looked at from <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> it is a huge amount of money." [...] Lovell compares the figure to extend the rights to 100 years to the £600million KirchGruppe paid for the rights to the 2002 Football World Cup and the £1.1billion British Sky Broadcasting paid for a three-year package of English Premier League football. The figure was not entirely comparable however due to the dispute over who actually owned Formula One. Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to [...] "do a scorched earth" [...] if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One. Mosley came up with the solution in order for the FIA to retain its sporting management role and Ecclestone to retain his commercial role.|$|E
