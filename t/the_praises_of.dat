Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E

25|$|The Bhakti Movement was a {{rapid growth}} of bhakti, first {{starting}} in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Vishnu.

25|$|Communist China again {{compensated}} Albania for {{the loss}} of Soviet economic support, supplying about 90% of the parts, foodstuffs, and other goods the Soviet Union had promised. Beijing lent the Albanians money on more favorable terms than Moscow, and, unlike Soviet advisers, Chinese technicians earned the same low pay as Albanian workers and lived in similar housing. China also presented Albania with a powerful radio transmission station from which Tirana sang <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Stalin, Hoxha, and Mao Zedong for decades. For its part, Albania offered China a beachhead in Europe and acted as Communist China's chief spokesman at the UN. To Albania's dismay, however, Chinese equipment and technicians were not nearly as sophisticated as the Soviet goods and advisers they replaced. Ironically, a language barrier even forced the Chinese and Albanian technicians to communicate in Russian. Albanians no longer took part in Warsaw Pact activities or Comecon agreements. The other East European communist nations, however, did not break diplomatic or trade links with Albania. In 1964, the Albanians {{went so far as to}} seize the empty Soviet embassy in Tirana, and Albanian workers pressed on with construction of the Palace of Culture on their own.|$|E

500|$|In some legends, Hausa—described as a Varkari—is {{credited}} for Kanhopatra's {{journey to}} devotion. Other accounts credit the Varkari pilgrims who passed Kanhopatra's house {{on their way}} to the temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur. According to one story, for example, she asked a passing Varkari about Vithoba. The Varkari said that Vithoba is [...] "generous, wise, beautiful and perfect", his glory is beyond description and his beauty surpasses that of Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty. Kanhopatra further asked if Vithoba would accept her as a devotee. The Varkari assured her that Vithoba would accept her as he accepted the maid Kubja, the sinful king Ajamila and the so-called [...] "untouchable" [...] saint Chokhamela. This assurance strengthened her resolve to go to Pandharpur. In versions of the legend where Sadashiva does not appear, Kanhopatra immediately leaves for Pandharpur—singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Vithoba—with the Varkari pilgrims or coaxes her mother to accompany her to Pandharpur.|$|E
500|$|Various {{episodes of}} the show have {{generated}} controversy.

[...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Desperate Housewives was [...] "a brilliantly conceived and relentlessly entertaining new drama". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the series had [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity". Peter Schorn of IGN felt that season one was [...] "blessed with an attractive cast (sing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> older women!), sharp writing and a funky vibe of its own" [...] and that [...] "Desperate Housewives was able {{to take some of the}} oldest formulas in the book and infuse them with their own subversive twists to whip up a frothy confection of sly wit and dark motives."

500|$|Nandanar {{was born}} in poverty, in Pulaippadi, the Pulai slums of Adanur. He was a staunch devotee of the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. He was a leather maker, who crafted drums and other musical instruments. He {{also served as a}} village servant, a watchman, a {{labourer}} as well as the [...] "town crier", who used to beat the drums. In Nandanar's times, Dalits were not allowed to enter Hindu temples. So, Nandanar would stand outside a Shiva temple and sing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Shiva and dance. However, he harboured a strong urge to pay his respects to the icon of Shiva at Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur. He stood outside the temple, but a huge stone Nandi (the bull mount of Shiva, whose sculpture is generally seen in Shiva temples, facing Shiva in the garbhagriha - sanctum sanctorum) blocked his path of vision. The compassionate Shiva ordered Nandi to move a little to side and the bull complied, allowing the Nayanar to see the central icon of Shiva, unobstructed. Nandanar cleaned up the surroundings of the temple and dug a pond (which serves as the temple tank) in honour of Shiva. He circumambulated the shrine and returned to Adanur.|$|E

[...] Rick Bell of Country Standard Time stated, [...] "It's an impressive debut that, while she pines about lost love and Tim McGraw, will likely have others singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> Taylor Swift." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters praised the song, commenting it was [...] "good enough to recall {{some of the best}} country singles of recent years", such as [...] Rachel Proctor's [...] "Me and Emily" [...] and Julie Roberts's [...] "Break Down Here." [...] He complimented Swift's vocal abilities on the song, saying it was executed [...] "quite perfectly", something she was unable to carry throughout the album Taylor Swift. However, Holland was repugnant of the song's title. In 2007, [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] was listed as a [...] "Winning Song" [...] by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Vespertine {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics.

Heather Phares from AllMusic called it [...] "an album singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> peace and quiet", praising it for proving that [...] "intimacy {{can be just}} as compelling as louder emotions". Anthony Carew from About.com gave the album the highest rating and said it was [...] "quite possibly the best album of the '00s". He considered the album to be self-aware of [...] "the digital epoch [...] had just dawned upon the realm of recorded music" [...] in the early 2000s, noting that it is [...] "not just a product of this brave new non-world, but wholly informed by that." [...] The A.V. Clubs Keith Phipps found it to be: [...] "an album both timeless and of the moment, an avant-garde electronic-pop exploration of classic themes". David Fricke of Rolling Stone felt that Vespertine was: [...] "the sound and sentiment of a woman exulting in the power and possibility of her gift, one who has finally figured out how to grow up without growing old." [...] In a later review for The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Douglas Wolk described the album as [...] "a banquet in the hall of Björk's personal erotics" [...] and stated that [...] "it's not the stuff of radio hits, but the music is spectacular".|$|E
