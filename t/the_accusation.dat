5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. <b>The</b> <b>accusation</b> in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede {{of having}} {{committed}} heresy {{in his work}} De Temporibus. The standard theological view of world history {{at the time was}} known as the Six Ages of the World; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, and {{came to the conclusion that}} Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. <b>The</b> <b>accusation</b> occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made <b>the</b> <b>accusation.</b> Wilfrid did not respond to <b>the</b> <b>accusation,</b> but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 945, however, at {{the urging}} of their sister, the Augusta Helena, another coup removed the two Lekapenoi from power under <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> that they {{attempted}} to poison Constantine VII, and restored the sole imperial authority to the latter.|$|E
50|$|The fifth apostolic vicar of the Dutch Mission, Petrus Codde, was {{appointed}} in 1688. In 1691, the Jesuits {{accused him of}} favouring the Jansenist heresy.

5|$|The {{following}} day, the DA {{accused the}} ANC of abusing state resources after the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) was seen giving out blankets and toiletries at an ANC rally in Parys.

5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> of being an Azali was often enough for most to {{believe it to be}} true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining whether or not a particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E

In 2010, Mardas issued a statement denying that he had spread rumours.|$|E
5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated Press on an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support <b>the</b> <b>accusation.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the civil war in Syria, Turkey has been accused of intense {{co-operation}} with Islamic State. <b>The</b> <b>accusations</b> have been coming for some time from the West, and also from the Turkish opposition and the Kurds.

25|$|The jurors of {{the trial}} voted the guilt of Socrates by a narrow margin (36a). In the Apology of Socrates, Plato cites no numbers of votes condemning or acquitting the philosopher of <b>the</b> <b>accusations</b> of moral {{corruption}} and impiety; although Socrates did say {{he would have been}} acquitted if thirty more jurors had voted in his favour. In such cases — where the penalty of death might arise as legal sanction for <b>the</b> <b>accusations</b> presented — Athenian law required that the prosecutor and the defendant each propose an administrative penalty to punish the actions reported in <b>the</b> <b>accusations.</b>|$|R

On 6 February, with no withdrawal forthcoming, Gordon-Cumming issued writs against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 2002, U.S. Marine Corps Major Michael Brown {{attempted}} an {{indecent assault}} on a Filipina bartender in Okinawa, Japan.

5|$|The fan car and {{hydropneumatic}} suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among those {{to claim that the}} cars were fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. <b>The</b> <b>accusation</b> was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and {{his chief}} counsel, Roy Cohn, of {{improperly}} pressuring the Army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, {{a former aide}} to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the Army as a private. McCarthy claimed that <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, <b>the</b> <b>accusation</b> was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been {{propaganda}} {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
