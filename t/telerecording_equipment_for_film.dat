50|$|Daniel {{was well}} aware of the scope of cinema as a public medium. He wished to popularise Kalarippayattu by {{harnessing}} the popular influence of cinema.

The Steenbeck's lower light levels and controllable speed make it a preferred piece of <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>film</b> archives (such as the Library of Congress' motion picture collection) and restoration facilities as prints can be quickly and easily inspected with less risk of damage compared to a movie projector. Because there is no intermittent movement, the image is created through a rotating prism which scans the frames.
