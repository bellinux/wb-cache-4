50|$|<b>Train</b> <b>{{printers}}</b> {{and band}} printers in Rochester {{were developed in}} {{a joint venture with}} NCR and ICL, with CDC holding controlling interest. This joint venture was known as Computer Peripherals, Inc. (CPI). In the early 80s, it was merged with dot matrix computer manufacturer Centronics.|$|R
50|$|Tilling was a <b>trained</b> <b>printer,</b> {{rather than}} a railwayman, and became a {{director}} of the Locomotive Publishing Co. He took a keen amateur interest in railways though and was an early member of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers. He wrote a number of monographs on locomotives, The Locomotives of the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway (1920) and the three-volume Locomotives of the Southern Railway.|$|R
50|$|Chain or <b>train</b> <b>printers,</b> {{where the}} {{character}} set is arranged multiple times around a linked chain or {{a set of}} character slugs in a track traveling horizontally past the print line. The IBM 1403 {{is perhaps the most}} popular, and comes in both chain and train varieties. The band printer is a later variant where the characters are embossed on a flexible steel band. The LP27 from Digital Equipment Corporation is a band printer.|$|R

50|$|With the Liverpool {{printing}} industry facing periodic unemployment and worsening industrial conditions, formally <b>trained</b> <b>printers</b> and stationers Jabez Walter Banfield and James Gearing emigrated to Australia {{in search of}} gold. Arriving on 10 October 1852, they followed the Victorian gold rush to Melbourne, where they went into partnership with Edward Holt Nuthall, a printer recently arrived from India. In May 1855 the trio returned to the central goldfields {{to invest in a}} printing plant in Maryborough. Between 1855 and 1864 Banfield and Gearing were associated with newspaper or printing offices in thirteen towns.|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} {{family was}} released for general use in 1929, with a first showing in Monotype's specimen booklet The <b>Trained</b> <b>Printer</b> and the Amateur by Alfred W. Pollard. Monotype {{described it as}} a 'long-descender type of great distinction', emphasising its feeling of not having been restricted to allow tighter linespacing, as other types often had been in the hot metal period. Monotype has sold the design with bold and bold italic designs (their invention, since bold type did not exist until much later), and swash italic alternate characters.|$|R

5000|$|At her {{resignation}} {{from the}} KOL, {{she seemed to}} backtrack on her entire mission by stating, [...] "If it were possible, I wish that it were not necessary for women to learn any trade but that of domestic duties, as I believe it was intended that man should be the bread-winner". While such a sentiment appears contrary to her entire cause, {{she went on to}} qualify her statement by adding, [...] "But as that is impossible under present conditions, I believe women should have every opportunity to become proficient in whatever vocation they choose or find themselves best fitted for." [...] Lake, a <b>trained</b> <b>printer</b> and the proofreader and telegraph editor of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, resided in St. Louis.|$|R
50|$|SPCK {{has worked}} {{overseas}} since its foundation. The initial focus was the British colonies in the Americas. Libraries were {{established for the}} use of clergy and their parishioners, and frequent shipments of books were sent across the Atlantic throughout the eighteenth century. By 1709 SPCK was spreading further afield: a printing press and <b>trained</b> <b>printer</b> were sent out to Tranquebar in East India to assist in the production of the first translation of the Bible into Tamil done by the German Lutheran missionaries Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Pluetschau from the Danish-Halle Mission. For its time this was a remarkably far-sighted example of ecumenical co-operation, and SPCK has continued to work closely with churches of many different denominations, whilst retaining a special relationship with churches within the Anglican Communion.|$|R

5000|$|Wat {{was born}} in 1785. The missionaries later {{reported}} that his life before meeting them had been [...] "improvident", having abandoned {{his wife and child}} [...] "entirely" [...] and wandering without any regular employment. He apparently visited England [...] "several times" [...] before 1816. Wylie records that he was [...] "connected with the London Mission as a printer, almost from its first establishment", but he passes unmentioned in Robert Morrison's journals of his early years in Macao and Guangzhou (then romanized as [...] "Canton"). Morrison, the first Protestant missionary in the Qing Empire, undertook translation and adaption of the 1714 Kangxi Dictionary alongside his translation of the Bible into Chinese. Through his comprador Yong Sam-tak, he either hired <b>trained</b> <b>printers</b> or <b>trained</b> his hired servants to cut the wooden type and operate the presses needed. He also asked his employees to attend Sunday services and daily meetings at his home.|$|R

However, in 1898 he fled to France in face of the repression implemented by Luigi Pelloux.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{principal}} goals of the Tamarind Institute is the <b>training</b> of <b>printers.</b> Over the years, the training of these professionals has evolved since its creation in 1960. What began as an eight-week basic training course eventually developed into a two-year program. There are five levels in the program: student printer, candidate printer, assistant printer, senior printer, and master printer. There have been over 100 Master Program certificates awarded by the Tamarind Institute.|$|R

5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} Septimus Winner's [...] "Spelling Bee" [...] (AKA [...] "Ba Be Bi Bo Bu") were {{slightly}} different. What's more, his {{was not the}} original version, either. In fact, a number of schools like Harvard University used this {{as one of their}} traditional songs, which itself may have originated centuries earlier in typesetting, as a very similar song or chant was used to help <b>train</b> apprentice <b>printers</b> in the structure of language, a tradition being described as [...] "ancient" [...] even as early as 1740: ...|$|R
50|$|Samuel Revans {{is known}} to have been a native of London but, as was common in the early 19th century, the day, month and even the exact year of his birth have been lost to history. He was <b>trained</b> as a <b>printer,</b> and worked in London.|$|R
50|$|Boarman's {{career in}} the {{printing}} industry spans 40 years. A Practical <b>Printer</b> <b>trained</b> under the apprenticeship program of the International Typographical Union (ITU), he served his apprenticeship at McArdle Printing Company in Washington, D.C. In 1974, he accepted an appointment as a Journeyman Printer at the Government Printing Office (GPO).|$|R
5000|$|He <b>trained</b> as a <b>printer</b> with Daniel Fowle in Portsmouth. In May 1776, {{he became}} the {{publisher}} of the Freeman's Journal, or New Hampshire Gazette. While in Portsmouth he also ran a school; organized an [...] "intelligence office;" [...] sold Beverly Corduroy, India goods, real estate; and attempted a singing group.|$|R
5000|$|Chain {{printers}} (also {{known as}} <b>train</b> <b>printers)</b> placed the type on moving bars (a horizontally-moving chain). As with the drum printer, as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer {{was fired from}} behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to [...] "pass by" [...] was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these printers by timing the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano. IBM was probably the best-known chain printer manufacturer and the IBM 1403 {{is probably the most}} famous example of a chain printer.|$|R
