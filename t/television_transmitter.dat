5|$|Nearby is St Joseph's College {{founded in}} 1855, {{one of the}} first Catholic {{educational}} institutions to be opened in England following the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy. Beulah Hill was the site of Britain's first independent <b>television</b> <b>transmitter,</b> built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955. Beulah Hill ends at a junction with the A212 (Church Road). From this junction, the A215 is called South Norwood Hill.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as Walworth Road, the A215 becomes Camberwell Road—much {{of which}} is a {{conservation}} area—after entering the former Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Crossing the A202, the A215 becomes Denmark Hill, originally known as Dulwich Hill, but renamed in 1683 to commemorate the marriage of Princess Anne (later Queen Anne) to Prince George of Denmark. After passing Herne Hill railway station the road becomes Norwood Road, Knights Hill, and then Beulah Hill at its crossroads with the A214. Beulah Hill was the site of Britain's first independent <b>television</b> <b>transmitter,</b> built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955. Descending towards South Norwood the A215 becomes South Norwood Hill and then Portland Road, just after crossing the A213. A short section starting at the junction with Woodside Green is known as Spring Lane, leading to Shirley Road, the final section into Shirley, Croydon.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 1939 {{comes into}} {{operation}} in Rome the first <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast {{for about a}} year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city.|$|E

25|$|CBC {{announced}} on April 4, 2012, {{that it will}} shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmitters</b> on July 31, 2012 with no plans to install digital transmitters in their place, thus reducing {{the total number of}} the corporation's <b>television</b> <b>transmitters</b> across the country down to 27. According to the CBC, this would reduce the corporation's yearly costs by $10 million. No plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both CBC and Radio-Canada in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter. In fact, in its CRTC application to shut down all of its analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmitters,</b> the CBC communicated its opposition to use of subchannels, citing costs, amongst other reasons.|$|R
25|$|Bendigo in Central Victoria {{also has}} an Amateur <b>Television</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (VK3RBO) on the 13cm band. This can be {{received}} using surplus microwave dishes and downconverters. The station is known to show episodes of the Amateur Television Program 'Amateurlogic'.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} later, on May 31, 1954, CBWT {{began as a}} bilingual station on channel 4 with an EIRP of 60,000 watts. In {{the same year that}} CBWT went to air, another station, KXJB-TV (Valley City/Fargo, North Dakota) also began broadcasting. There were doubts from the start whether there would be {{interference}} between the two stations. Its first equipment consisted of an RCA Victor TT10AL <b>Television</b> <b>Transmitter</b> and a 196-foot 6-section Super Turnstile Type TF-6AM Television Antenna, located atop the station's roof.|$|E
25|$|Before May 2009, {{the links}} to Lancashire and the North West were also {{seen in the}} media with Todmorden {{receiving}} an analogue TV signal from BBC North West. The local <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> relayed BBC One and BBC Two to the Todmorden area, however ITV and Channel 4 was different and has always been relayed from Emley Moor (via Cornholme) which broadcasts ITV Yorkshire. Since 2009 all services were relayed via Cornholme so local television links with the North West were lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{company also}} ran {{production}} offices and {{a studio in}} Dover, to serve {{the eastern part of}} its region. The studios were opened in 1961, after the ITA's VHF Dover <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> went into operation the year before. The studios on Russell Street were mainly used for regional news production although some non-news programmes including the long-running rural affairs series Farm Progress, feature series and documentaries such as Elusive Butterflies and Dougalling and the nightly Epilogue (known for years as Guideline) were also produced from Dover.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s an outside {{broadcast}} {{was made from}} {{the very top of}} the tower, in which the first passage of a satellite across the London sky was watched and described. It continued to be used for BBC News broadcasts until 1969, and for the Open University until the early 1980s. The antenna mast still stands and is used for local terrestrial television transmission, local commercial radio and DAB broadcasts. The main London <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> is now at Crystal Palace in south London.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, KRON-TV began {{broadcasting}} most Oakland Raiders games, {{which were}} at {{first part of}} the American Football League, which had a contract with NBC from 1965 to 1969, and then the National Football League's American Football Conference, which inherited the AFL's deal with NBC from 1970 to 1997 (the Raiders relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, stripping KRON of its status as the team's home station until they returned to Oakland in 1995). In 1967, KRON-FM-TV moved to a new studio at 1001 Van Ness Avenue in the Western Addition neighborhood (a location that formerly served as the site of the Roman Catholic cathedral of San Francisco), where channel 4 operated until 2014. The <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> was moved to Sutro Tower on July 4, 1973, while the FM transmitter remained on San Bruno Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{acquisition}} of the licence, CTL needed to find suitable sites for both a studio and a transmitter. Initially, Mount Ainslie (approximately 10km north-east of Canberra's city centre, at an elevation of 842 m above sea level) was considered as a potential transmitter site. It was turned down, however, because it was already {{under the control of}} the Department of Civil Aviation (who would be unwilling to surrender or lease the site due to its proximity to the Airport and the Air Force base). It was also determined that a transmitter located atop Mount Ainslie would not provide ample coverage of the entire Canberra area (notable black-spots would have included the Woden and Belconnen districts), nor would there be enough room for the ABC's <b>television</b> <b>transmitter</b> (whose service was due to commence in December 1962) as well as CTC. Other sites considered included Mounts Gray, Bowning, Ginini and Bull's Head.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{television}} {{was introduced to}} Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television {{to the rest of}} the country and advertised for bids. Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a <b>television</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and News Chronicle executives George and Alfred Black. This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children's programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957. Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was programme director, and both brothers were prominent board members. The company opened its first Newcastle office at Bradburn House on Northumberland Street, and it was from there, on 3 January 1958, the company directors issued 300,000 ordinary shares at fours shillings each.|$|E
