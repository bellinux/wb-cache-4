5|$|After {{the song}} was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice were {{struggling}} to find a suitable musical actress for the songs and the titular role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, {{had moved to the}} United States. One day they were watching the British musical television show, Rock Follies, where <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like Godspell, and her acting abilities in Rock Follies convinced Rice and Lloyd Webber to sign her for Evita.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– except that the ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.|$|E

5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over unfamiliar enemy territory, on time and exactly on the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared the airfield <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. <b>They</b> <b>noticed</b> that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E

5|$|When Pettigrew's troops {{approached}} Gettysburg on June 30, <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving {{south of}} town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth {{what he had}} seen, neither general believed {{that there was a}} substantial U.S. force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. <b>They</b> <b>noticed</b> a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's radio call sign of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic {{exchanges between}} the Song and Jin {{did not stop}} during the period {{preceding}} the war. The History of Song claims that the Song realized that the Jin were planning for an invasion when <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> the discourtesy {{of one of the}} Jin diplomats. Some Song officials foresaw the impending war, but Emperor Gaozong hoped to maintain peaceful relations with the Song's northern neighbor. His reluctance to antagonize the Jin delayed the fortification of the Song border defenses. The Song quickly built just three military garrisons in 1161. Wanyan Liang departed from Kaifeng on October 15, 1161. The offensive comprised four armies, and Wanyan Liang personally led the army that entered Anhui. The Jin passed the Huai River boundary on October 28, advancing into Song territory. The Song resistance was minimal because they had fortified the southern shore of the Yangtze River and not the Huai.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, have said that <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> changes in him {{in the days and}} weeks prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the UK, Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani Linge) and took British military education. The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to Trøndelag in Norway together with Odd Sørli, Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen. The deployment was necessary as Evald Hansen and Herluf Nygaard had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at Falstad). Sørli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain Lark, establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship Tirpitz, at the time located in the Trondheimsfjord. When he was training at Glen More Lodge near Aviemore, Gjems-Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with Sørli he travelled to Inverness by train, and to Shetland by plane, under stormy weather conditions. They initially set out with the fishing boat Harald II from Scalloway in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach Ålesund; the last attempt destroyed their equipment as the boat was bursted open. They had their equipment replaced, and set out for Kristiansund in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> that they had reached Kya Lighthouse, much farther {{to the north of}} their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway. From there they travelled with fake identification via Namsos to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London. Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngvær to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when <b>they</b> <b>noticed</b> the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E
