40|$|Introduction: Pegylated Interferon Alpha (Peg-IFN) in {{combination}} with other drugs is the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) and is related to severe painful symptoms. The aim of this study was access the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in controlling the painful symptoms related to Peg-IFN side effects. Material and Methods: In this phase II double-blind trial, twenty eight (n= 28) HCV subjects were randomized to receive either five consecutive days of active tDCS (n= 14) or sham (n= 14) during five consecutive days with anodal stimulation over the primary motor cortex region using 2 mA for 20 minutes. The primary outcomes were visual analogue scale (VAS) pain and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels. Secondary outcomes were the pressure-pain threshold (PPT), the Brazilian Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (B-PCP:S) and drug analgesics use. Results: tDCS reduced the VAS scores (P< 0. 003), with a mean pain drop of 56 % (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, tDCS was able to enhance BDNF levels (p< 0. 01). The mean increase was 37. 48 % in the active group. Finally, tDCS raised PPT (p< 0. 001) and reduced the B-PCP:S scores and analgesic use (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Five sessions of tDCS were effective in reducing the painful symptoms in HCV patients undergoing Peg-IFN treatment. These findings support the efficacy of tDCS as a promising therapeutic tool to improve the tolerance of the side effects related to the use of Peg-IFN. Future larger studies (phase III and IV trials) are needed to confirm the clinical use of the therapeutic effects of tDCS in such condition.

40|$|Patent is {{the most}} {{important}} form of intellectual property protection for new drugs. Patent extension and market exclusivity currently serve as major regulatory incentives to promote new drugs. Combination drug, or fixed-dose combination (FDC) are formulations that contain two or more active ingredients in a single pill. FDCs, especially combinations of singe drugs that are already in the market, are common strategy for brand-name drug companies to extent the patent and exclusivity life. The substitution of single drug products that soon have generic alternatives with newer, brand-name combinations lead to potential increases in pharmaceutical expenditures and raises concerns on economic burden. The study found that the effective patent life increased overtime during the past three decades; however the effective patent life length was not significantly associated with {{an increase in the number}} of approved new molecular entities (NMEs), which often represent innovative new drugs. Other incentives, besides the patent life, need to be considered as effective incentives to stimulate pharmaceutical innovations. The findings support hypothesis that the number of FDC approvals increased overtime from 1980 s to 2012, while <b>the</b> <b>approval</b> <b>number</b> of the NME and new therapeutic Biologics License Applications decreased during last decade. The findings also support hypothesis that the pharmaceutical company market FDC drugs shortly before the generic versions of the single ingredients enter the market extending the patent and marketing exclusivity life of drugs included in the combination. In regard to the economic concern of the FDC, the study found that the FDC average wholesale price (AWP) unit price increased significantly over time 1980 - 2012 and that pharmaceutical companies set FDC AWP, at the same level of the costliest single active ingredient in the combination as pricing strategy to shift demand from single active ingredients facing generic competition toward new FDC drugs. The price difference between FDC and single ingredient drugs varied by therapeutic class, the year the FDC entered into the US market and the number of single drugs in the combination that have generic drugs at FDC market entry...|$|E
