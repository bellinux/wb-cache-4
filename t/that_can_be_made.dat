5|$|The {{nature of}} inferences <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from the A-not-B error has been challenged. Studies that {{have contributed to}} this {{discussion}} have examined the contribution of memory limitations, difficulty with spatial localization, and difficulty in inhibiting the motor act of reaching to location A on the A-not-B error.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} the {{complexity}} of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts– the maximum number <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from an artist's plasters and still be considered his work. As {{a result of this}} limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|A {{statement}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> however, is {{that most}} Americans will marry {{at least once in}} their lifetime with the first marriage most commonly ending in divorce. Today a little over half (52.3%) of US household include a married couple, showing a significant decrease since 1970 when 70.6% of households included a married couple. Current trends indicate that people in the US are marrying later and less often with higher divorce rates.|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the}} same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|Long before European contact, Cucurbita {{had been}} a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas, and the species became an {{important}} food for European settlers, including the Pilgrims, even featuring at the first Thanksgiving. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in pumpkin pie is most often varieties of C.moschata; Libby's, {{by far the largest}} producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of C.moschata for its canned pumpkin. Other foods <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. Squash soup is a dish in African cuisine. The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions. C.ficifolia is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.|$|E
