40|$|The use of {{multiple}} active <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps</b> for vibration reduction in a helicopter rotor is investigated using an optimization approach. The strong aeroelastic interaction between the unsteady aerodynamic environment and rotating blades are modeled using a comprehensive aeroelastic analysis for helicopter rotors. Pareto optimal points are investigated for tradeoff studies between vibration reduction and control deflections for one, two and four active <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps.</b> Numerical results using gradient-based optimization techniques show that four active <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps</b> placed at the blade tip and actuated at higher harmonics of the rotation speed yield a vibration reduction of about 72 percent in forward flight when vibration alone is minimized. Such flaps can be actuated by smart materials. It is shown that using upto four <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps</b> at the blade tip (outer 20 %) is optimal for reducing vibration with reasonably low control angle deflections and therefore low power requirements. It is possible to achieve significant reductions in control deflections by settling for somewhat lower vibration reductions...|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the above-wing engine installation, an unswept wing outfitted with a continuous <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> was also adopted; this possessed no unfavourable interaction with the engine flow. The continuous flap gave excellent low speed performance, however, during high speed travel, interference between the wing and pylon flow fields resulted in flow separation, which in turn limited the cruise Mn to 0.65. A recent aircraft, the HondaJet, which also featured an over-wing engine installation, used a supercritical wing which generated no unfavourable interference effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{compressor}} redesign, {{as well as}} {{addressing the}} need for high temperature materials such as Waspaloy in the rear stages had to address the aerodynamic shortcomings inherent in any turbomachine compressor when ingesting very hot air (800 F at Mach 3.2). The route chosen to keep the J58 compressor pumping was to bleed air from the compressor 4th stage through 6 external tubes to the afterburner. In addition a 2-position <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> {{was added to the}} inlet guide vanes. The bleed and adjustable flap position kept the compressor working efficiently despite the high temperature air delivered to it by the intake.|$|E
50|$|The forward wing {{was divided}} into two half spans so that their angles of {{incidence}} could be altered together to control pitch or independently for roll. The semi-spans were built around main box spars with spruce spar caps and plywood webs. Forward of the spar the wings were ply skinned, forming a D-shaped torsion box. Ribs were built from spruce trellis work. There was a secondary spar behind the main one and an over-all fabric covering. A trim tab was positioned inboard on {{the trailing edge of}} each half-span. The rear wing was similarly constructed but fixed in place. A long <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> could be raised, but not lowered, to steepen descents. The tips carried triangular endplate fins fitted with horn balanced rudders, spring centred and only opening outwards. These vertical tails were wooden structures with fabric covering.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1980s, the Laser 300 program {{became one}} of the first {{projects}} carried out cooperatively by NASA and private industry when a joint team used the Langley 12-Foot Low-Speed Tunnel to investigate the stability and control characteristics of the unusual design. Special attention was paid to behavior at high angles of attack and to stall and spin resistance. The results were unfavorable, indicating poor longitudinal stability at high angles of attack. The wing design was modified to address this problem, with an extension added to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap,</b> and a discontinuous, leading edge droop added to the outboard section of the wings. Stall characteristics were found to be good, however, since the canard was found to provide a nose-down pitching moment at the point of a stall. These changes were tested on the second prototype before the design was frozen in April 1985. Additionally, production machines were to have a redesigned fuselage of round cross-section, a redesigned nose, and additional baggage compartments.|$|E
50|$|The CL-1200 was to {{have kept}} the basic F-104 {{fuselage}} structure, increased in length to provide 46% extra internal fuel capacity. The fuselage extension consisted of a 30 in plug between the standard F-104 front and center fuselage sections. Unlike the F-104, the rear fuselage section was to be constructed using titanium alloy for the frames, longerons and skinning around the jet exhaust. The major revision of the design was a shoulder-mounted wing of 53% larger area which was also moved further aft. The new wing had a span of 29 ft and still featured leading and trailing edge flaps but gained new leading edge extensions, while the 10° anhedral of the Starfighter was retained. The flap system {{was designed to be}} either manual or automatic in operation; the system configuring them as required for load factor, airspeed and altitude. The new inner wing panels featured an additional <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> which doubled the area in comparison to the F-104; this would have improved short-field performance and lowered the landing speed. The boundary layer control system of the F-104 was deemed unnecessary due to the increased flap area and was omitted. The outer wing panels were virtually identical to those of the F-104.|$|E
50|$|The Hawk Major was {{designed}} as a successor to the Miles Hawk by F.G. Miles. Main changes were a de Havilland Gipsy III engine, metal (instead of wood) engine mount, and trousered undercarriage. The prototype (designated M.2F Hawk Major) was first flown in 1934 and went on to second place in the 1934 King's Cup Race at an average speed of 147.78 mph. A racing version was developed as the one-off single-seat M.2E Gipsy Six Hawk with a 200 hp de Havilland Gipsy Six engine. The production Hawk Major had the 130 hp de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. The aircraft sold well to private owners, including two that were fitted with smoke generators to allow them to be used as skywriters. An improved version (the M.2H) with a <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> replaced the M.2F on the production line. A number of special one-off racing versions were also built. In October 1934, Squadron Leader Malcolm Charles McGregor flew a Hawk Major from RAF Mildenhall to Melbourne, Australia in 7 days, 15 hours while competing in the MacRobertson Air Race. In 1936 Miles Hawk VI, G-ADOD was entered into the Schlesinger Race from Portsmouth to Johannesburg and flown by A. E. Clouston who nearly made {{it all the way to}} Johannesburg but had to make a forced crash landing due to engine trouble 150 miles south of Salisbury.|$|E

50|$|Fairey Aviation built {{a number}} of Sopwith Baby floatplanes at its Hamble works. A variant of the Sopwith Baby was built by the Fairey Aviation Co., Ltd. On 23 October 1916, Sopwith Baby No.8134 {{was sent to the}} Fairey works for repair, and the {{opportunity}} was taken to rebuild the aircraft to incorporate {{a number of}} modifications. The most significant was the Fairey Patent Camber Gear, which was a form of <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> used to increase lift. On the Fairey-built aircraft, the entire trailing edge of each wing was hinged along the rear spar, lowered by rotating a handwheel in the cockpit. A differential device ensured that the flaps could still be actuated as ailerons; thus, lateral control was maintained. In this modified form, the aircraft was known as the Fairey Hamble Baby. Production Hamble Babies differed in appearance from those built by Sopwith and Blackburn. The planform of wings and tailplane were changed: the wings had increased span and reduced chord, had rounded tips, and the tailplane had a characteristic shape different from the semi-circular outline of the Sopwith original. A new and angular fin, Fairey-designed main floats of new form, and an enlarged tail float were fitted, and the engine cowling was modified. Parnall also produced Hamble Babies, which had some detail differences from the Fairey produced aircraft. The last 74 aircraft were produced by Parnall as landplanes and known as the Hamble Baby Convert.|$|E

A theoretical and experimental investigation is undertaken {{to determine the effects of}} an actively deployable <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> on the disturbances created during blade-vortex interactions (BVI). The theoretical model consists of an unsteady panel code based on potential flow theory with provisions for deformable geometry to incorporate a <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap.</b> Experimental tests were conducted using a 2 -D wind tunnel setup incorporating a pressure instrumented airfoil section with a deployable 20 % <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> and an upstream vortex generator to produce and simulate BVI events. Results of this study showed that the disturbances caused by BVI events on the pressure distribution over the airfoil occur mostly at the leading edge. Carefully synchronized deployment of the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> during BVI events resulted in a reduction of this pressure disturbance. However, the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> deployment had additional effects on the pressure distributions which were not present in the purely BVI related disturbance. As a result, <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> deployments during BVI events resulted in an increase in the perturbation of the lift and moment coefficients relative to the perturbations caused by the BVI event alone...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to demonstrate a four blade rotor trim in forward flight using integrated trailing edge flaps instead of using a swashplate controls. A compact brushless DC motor was evaluated as an on-blade actuator, with the possibility of achieving large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> amplitudes. A control strategy to actuate the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> at desired frequency and amplitude was developed and large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> amplitudes from the motor (instead of rotational motion) were obtained. Once the actuator was tested on the bench-top, a lightweight mechanism was designed to incorporate the motor in the blade and actuate the trailing edge flaps. A six feet diameter, four bladed composite rotor with motor-flap system integrated into the NACA 0012 airfoil section was fabricated. Systematic testing was carried out for a range of load conditions, first in the vacuum chamber followed by hover tests. Large <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> deflections were observed during the hover testing, and a peak to peak <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> amplitude of 18 degree was achieved at 2000 rotor RPM with hover tip Mach number of 0. 628. A closed loop controller was designed to demonstrate <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> mean position and the peak to peak amplitude control. Further, a soft pitch link was designed and fabricated, to replace the stiff pitch link and thereby reduce the torsional stiffness of the blade to 2 /rev. This soft pitch link allowed for blade root pitch motion in response to the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> inputs. Blade pitch response due to both steady as well as sinusoidal flap deflections were demonstrated. Finally, tests were performed in Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel using a model rotor rig to assess the performance of motor-flap system in forward flight. A swashplateless trim using brushless DC motor actuated trailing edge flaps was achieved for a rotor operating at 1200 RPM and an advance ratio of 0. 28. Also, preliminary exploration was carried out to test the scalability of the motor driven <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> concept. In conclusion, the concept of using brushless DC motors as on-blade actuators, actuating trailing edge flaps has the potential to replace the current mechanically complex swashplate with a hydraulic-free swashplateless system and thereby reduce overall weight and hub drag...|$|E
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of the use}} of <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps</b> is {{that they}} produce significant negative pitching moment when in use. In order to balance this pitching moment the horizontal stabilizer must be somewhat larger than it would otherwise be, so that it can produce enough force to balance the negative pitching moment created by the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flaps.</b> This, in turn, means that the main wing must be somewhat larger than it would otherwise have be to balance the larger negative lift produced by the larger horizontal stabilizer.|$|R

This paper focuses on the application of zero-net-mass-flux periodic excitation near the airfoil <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> shoulder at a Mach number of 0. 1 and chord Reynolds numbers of 1. 2 x 10 (exp 6) to 9 x 10 (exp 6) with leading- and trailing-edge flap deflections of 25 deg. and 30 deg., respectively. The purpose of the investigation was to increase the zero-net-mass-flux options for controlling <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> separation by using a larger model than used on the low Reynolds number version of this model and to investigate the effect of flow control at higher Reynolds numbers. Static and dynamic surface pressures and wake pressures were acquired {{to determine the effects}} of flow control on airfoil performance.

The excitations around the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> are then combined to control <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> separation. The combination of two closely spaced actuators around the trailing-edge flap knee was shown to increase the lift produced by an individual actuator.

For subcritical interactions, the 2 -D results indicate that the <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap</b> can be used to alleviate the impulsive loads experienced by the airfoil. For supercritical interactions, the results show the necessity of using a leading edge flap, rather than a <b>trailing</b> <b>edge</b> <b>flap,</b> to alleviate the interaction.
