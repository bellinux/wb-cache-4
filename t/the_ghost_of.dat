5000|$|Hungry ghosts are {{different}} from <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> Chinese traditions, which all people are believed to become after death. According to the Buddha Dharma, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts: those with no wealth, those with a little and those with a lot. [...] Those with no wealth are broken into three groups: the torch or flaming mouths, in which food and drink become flames; the needle mouths, whose throats are so tiny that food cannot pass through; and the vile mouths, whose mouths are so decomposed and smelly that they cannot ingest anything. <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> with a little wealth are able to eat small amounts. <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> with great wealth also have three subgroups: <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> sacrifices, who live off sacrifices offered by humans and are similar to spirits described in China; <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> losses, who live off lost objects from the human world; and <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> great powers, like yakshas and rakshasas, who are <b>the</b> powerful rulers <b>of</b> <b>ghosts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> sacrifices and losses sometimes suffer from hunger and thirst, whereas <b>the</b> <b>ghosts</b> <b>of</b> great powers have pleasures close to those of divine beings. Among hungry ghosts, however, most {{have little or no}} wealth and are extremely hungry.|$|R

5|$|Day-Lewis {{returned}} to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed during the scene where <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> Hamlet's father appears before him. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused {{to go back on}} stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis {{for the rest of the}} run, except that Charleson's ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> his own father. He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. <b>The</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam.

He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E

A séance brings back <b>the</b> <b>ghost</b> <b>of</b> his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E
