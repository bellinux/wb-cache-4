500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave a {{positive}} review of both Liz and Jack's plot, {{but was not}} favorable towards Jenna and Tracy's, opining that [...] "Floyd" [...] {{was one of those}} episodes of 30 Rock where their plot [...] "really dragged the show down." [...] He reported that he felt bad for Liz [...] "because of all the guys [...] has dated over these four seasons, 's the one she should end up with." [...] Sassone hoped the episode would have concluded with the two finding out [...] "something horrible" [...] about Floyd's fiancée [...] "or maybe we'd find out that Floyd did all of this just to get close to Liz again in some weird way". Like Sassone, Time contributor James Poniewozik said that the Floyd character [...] "was one of the better drawn boyfriends for Liz". Further in his recap, Poniewozik was [...] "a little disappointed" [...] that the episode brought him back [...] "to get sloppy drunk, to <b>tell</b> <b>off</b> Liz... and to get engaged to a vapid-seeming 'ab model.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented that Sudeikis's return gave Tina Fey's Liz [...] "one of her more down-to-earth and relatable stories in a while", and enjoyed the Frank, Toofer, and Lutz rivalry with Jack and Danny, as well as Pete's involvement in the Jenna and Tracy story. Overall, Sepinwall said that the episode did not [...] "really hang together for me." ...|$|E
