40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in a selected fish and seafood processing line. Results showed that during 2013, 12. 4 %, 8. 3 % and 2. 3 % of fish, seafood salads and environmental swabs were positive for L. monocytogenes. All positive food samples showed a contamination level below 100 CFU/g. Environmental swabs from surface of slicing and trimming tables, slicing machines, fish filleting and <b>trimming</b> <b>knives,</b> belt glazer and working table were positive for L. monocytogenes. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to cleaning and disinfection to control the level of L. monocytogenes...|$|R

Afterwards, it is sprinkled with salt water. Green onions are cut diagonally and the garlic and ginger are mashed. The red pepper is sliced into small bits.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} attain a better {{understanding}} of the seasonal variations of macronutrient contents in different components and identify clones of Chinese white poplar, three representative clones in a four-year old poplar plantation were studied in each season of the year 2008. The plantation was a randomized complete block design. We collected leaves (growing seasons only), bark and xylem of twigs, branches, stem and roots with a tree <b>trimmer</b> <b>knife</b> and an increment borer in the spring (17 April), summer (14 July), autumn (23 September) and winter (9 December). Each sample was a mixture from 3 - 4 model trees in the block, and then digested by a H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O 2 solution to measure N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents. Results showed that the order of macronutrient contents in all samples was N> Ca> K> Mg> P. Seasonal changes in N, P and K contents in each component had clearly specific trends through the year, while Ca and Mg contents varied irregularly except in leaves. The P and K contents in twigs were particularly high in spring, and roots always had high K contents through the seasons. The nutrient elements contents in the bark of branches and stems were almost 1. 5 - 4. 0 times and 2. 5 - 9. 0 times higher than those in the woody tissues, respectively. According to the ANOVA of nutrient contents in each component, especially for the season factor, N, P, Ca and Mg nutrition contents in branch wood varied significantly, and in regard to the clone factor, K, Ca and Mg contents differed significantly in stem bark. Overall, macronutrient elements contents in all parts changed throughout the four seasons. To better manage these fast-growing poplars plantations, it is necessary to retain the foliage, twigs and roots in the cultivated stands, and to remove the bark of stems and branches and leave them in the stands as well...|$|R
5000|$|The skiving process, meaning [...] "to slice", can {{be applied}} to a variety of {{applications}} and materials. In leather, skiving <b>knives</b> <b>trim</b> the thickness of the leather, often around the edges, to thin the material and make it easier to work with. In metal working, skiving can be used to remove a thin dimension of material or to create thin slices in an existing material, such as heat sinks where a large amount of surface area is required relative to the volume of the piece of metal.|$|R
60|$|And {{this is how}} {{we could}} roast a turkey: after drawing the {{entrails}} from the bird, we filled him full of chinquapin nuts, which grow profusely in this land, and are, perhaps, of some relation to the chestnut. An oaken stick, sufficiently long to reach {{from one side of the}} fireplace to the other, and <b>trimmed</b> with <b>knives</b> until it was no larger around than the ramrod of a matchlock, forms our spit, and this we thrust through the body of the bird from end to end. A pile of rocks on either side of the fireplace, at a proper distance from the burning wood, serves as rests for the ends of the wooden spit, and when thus placed the bird will be cooked in front of the fire, if whosoever is attending to the labor turns the carcass from time to time, so that each portion may receive an equal amount of heat.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{mechanical}} systems are being utilized by the pork industry to efficiently and economically recover meat remaining on bones after fabrication. The recovered meat, {{referred to as}} pork trim-finely textured (PTFT), has unique properties which must be understood to best use this lean meat source. This research characterized the chemical and physical properties of PTFT, determined incorporation levels in ground pork and studied the storage and shelf-life-stability of products containing PTFT. Chemical and physical properties of PTFT were compared to <b>knife</b> <b>trimmed</b> meat (KT) and 80 percent lean ground pork (GP). PTFT had higher iron, calcium, total pigment and cholesterol than GP or KT. Moisture and fat content of PTFT {{did not differ from}} GP. When PTFT (0, 5, 10 and 15 percent) was incorporated into ground pork patties (10 percent and 20 percent fat), redness and sensory juiciness increased and hardness and cohesiveness decreased at all levels of incorporation. Storage stability of patties containing up to 15 percent PTFT displayed for four days under retail conditions were not affected by PTFT as measured by lipid oxidation, microbial counts and pH. PTFT obtained by mechanical recovery appears to be an exceptional substitute for pork trim in ground pork formulations. PTFT does not negatively influence, and may enhance, the attributes of ground pork when added below 15 percent. Utilization of PTFT contributes to the profitability of the pork industry which is already recognizing the benefits of mechanical recovery due to a reduction in repetitive motion syndrome, which is typically associated with <b>knife</b> <b>trimming...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... h is {{sheet metal}} with a {{thickness}} less than [...] The rolling {{is done in}} a cluster mill because the small thickness requires a small diameter rolls. To {{reduce the need for}} small rolls pack rolling is used, which rolls multiple sheets together to increase the effective starting thickness. As the foil sheets come through the rollers, they are trimmed and slitted with circular or razor-like <b>knives.</b> <b>Trimming</b> refers to the edges of the foil, while slitting involves cutting it into several sheets. Aluminum foil is the most commonly produced product via pack rolling. This is evident from the two different surface finishes; the shiny side is on the roll side and the dull side is against the other sheet of foil.|$|R
5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills <b>trimmed</b> with a <b>knife</b> and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a recently invented "steam pasteurization" (S) process in reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef was determined and {{compared with that of}} other standard commercial methods including <b>knife</b> <b>trimming</b> (T), water washing (35 °C; W), hot water/steam vacuum spot cleaning (V), and spraying with 2 % vol/vol lactic acid (54 °C, pH 2. 25; L). These decontamination treatments were tested individually and in combinations. Cutaneus trunci muscles from freshly slaughtered steers were inoculated with feces containing Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, and Salmonella typhimurium over a predesignated meat surface area, resulting in initial populations of ca. 5 log CFU/cm 2 of each pathogen. Tissue samples were excised from each portion before and after decontamination treatments, and mean population reductions were determined. Treatment combinations evaluated were the following (treatment designations within the abbreviations indicate the order of application) : TW, TWS, WS, VW, VWS, TWLS, and VWLS. These combinations resulted in reductions ranging from 3. 5 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2 in all three pathogen populations. The TW, TWS, WS, TWLS, and VWLS combinations were equally effective (P > 0. 05), resulting in reductions ranging from 4. 2 to 5. 3 log CFU/cm 2. When used individually, T, V, and S resulted in pathogen reductions ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 7 log CFU/cm 2 Steam pasteurization consistently provided numerically greater pathogen reductions than T or V. Treatments T, V, and S were all more effective than W (which gave a reduction on the order of 1. 0 log CFU/cm 2) Steam pasteurization is an effective method for reducing pathogenic bacterial populations on surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef, with multiple decontamination procedures providing greatest overall reductions...|$|R
40|$|Small {{and very}} small {{slaughterhouses}} generally spray lactic acid for carcass decontamination utilizing a hand held sprayer. Even though this tool represents {{a very small}} investment, it may present important disadvantages such as uneven delivery of the spray over the carcass surface. If the decontamination treatment is not applied properly, the untreated areas of the carcass will still have high bacterial loads present and could be a source for recontamination of the areas that have been treated. A sanitizer spraying system (sanitizing halo system) was designed and assembled. The sanitizing halo system was tested at the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, Texas A&M University. Thirteen carcasses were split in halves. Thirteen halves were sampled and used as control after <b>knife</b> <b>trimming</b> and water wash; then they were sprayed with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C with the sanitizing halo system. The other 13 halves were sprayed by the RMSTC employees utilizing a hand held sprayer. Counts of aerobic and mesophilic bacteria obtained from carcasses sprayed with the sanitizing halo system and the hand held sprayer were both {{significantly lower than the}} control counts. In addition, coliforms counts were below the detectable limit for the sanitizing halo system and the hand held sprayer. After testing, the sanitizing halo system was installed at two small commercial slaughter plants processing beef and pork carcasses. At each slaughter plant, 24 carcass halves were treated with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C using the sanitizing halo system, and the other 24 halves were used as control. Mesophilic bacteria populations were reduced in beef and pork carcasses by 2. 9 and 1. 9 log cycles, respectively, after the lactic acid treatment. Also E. coli counts were significantly lower in the three regions sampled after application of the 2 % L-Lactic acid with the sanitizing halo system. From the data collected during this study, we recommend the sanitizing halo system as a tool to reduce the bacterial loads on the surface of beef and pork carcasses. The use of this system should help small and very small slaughterhouses to improve food safety performance while providing cost-efficiency, simplicity, and convenience...|$|R
