5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> walls, and, on occasion, {{the use of}} wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} di Penates is more defined in Etruria: Arnobius (citing a Caesius) {{states that the}} Etruscan Penates were named Fortuna, Ceres, Genius Iovialis and Pales; {{according}} to Nigidius Figulus, they included those of Jupiter, of Neptune, of the infernal gods and of mortal men. According to Varro the Penates reside in <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> Heaven and are called Consentes and Complices by the Etruscans because they rise and set together, are twelve in number and their names are unknown, six male and six females and are the cousellors and masters of Jupiter. Martianus states they are always in agreement among themselves. While these last gods {{seem to be the}} Penates of Jupiter, Jupiter himself along with Juno and Minerva is one of the Penates of man according to some authors.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the episode were mixed. After the episode aired, Silber was {{disappointed}} in its resolution, writing, [...] "This episode adeptly combines surrealism {{and a sense of}} impending climax—only to sputter out in disappointment when nothing much gets resolved at the end." [...] He dismissed [...] "Mulder's one-week recovery from his horrifying ordeal" [...] as [...] "facile and unconvincing". He did write that Mulder's dream provided [...] "credible insight into <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> his troubled personality". The X-Files researcher and independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a three out of five score after the episode aired. She argued that, in the episode, Mulder [...] "is not a martyr but a victim" [...] which makes him [...] "pitiable, not heroic". Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, gave the episode a positive review, noting that the [...] "Duchovny-penned final scene is exquisite in showcasing the beauty and power of Mulder and Scully's evolving relationship." [...] He deemed Mulder's dream sequences [...] "inspired television" [...] and felt that the episode left itself open to interpretation. In the October 2000 issue of Cinefantastique, writer Paula Vitaris gave the episode a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four. She criticized the recycling of the [...] "one partner lies comatose while the other runs around trying to find a cure" [...] storyline, but she was more positive towards Mulder's reverie, calling it visually [...] "beautiful".|$|E
500|$|The Pennsylvania State Capitol {{houses the}} {{chambers}} for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine {{between the first}} and second floors, and a basement. [...] The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine {{between the first and}} second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the [...] "four forces of civilization": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and [...] "symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization". The lunettes are situated in <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works.

2500|$|Intaglio [...] is {{a family}} of printmaking {{techniques}} in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by etching, engraving, drypoint, aquatint or mezzotint. Collographs may also be printed as intaglio plates. [...] To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes {{with the aid of}} newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the plate to the paper.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1920, the Greek army {{advanced}} further east into Anatolia, {{with the}} encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of Sèvres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power {{and was replaced by}} Dimitrios Gounaris. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force Mustafa Kemal into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: [...] "The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly defiles, and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, vanished into <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> Anatolia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required {{that he be}} a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs {{to be close to}} those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in <b>the</b> <b>recesses</b> <b>of</b> the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E
