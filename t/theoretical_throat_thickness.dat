40|$|An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{model has}} been applied to the {{prediction}} of key weld geometries produced using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) with alternating shielding gases. This is a recently developed method of supplying shielding gases to the weld area in which the gases are discretely supplied at a given frequency. The model can be used to predict the penetration, leg length and effective <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> for a given set of weld parameters and alternating shielding gas frequency. A comparison between the experimental and predicted geometries matched closely and demonstrates the effectiveness of this software approach in predicting weld outputs. The model has shown that the application of alternating shielding gases increases the penetration and effective <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> of a fillet weld whilst the leg length is reduced. A sensitivity analysis was performed which showed that the travel speed is the most influential input parameter when predicting weld geometries, this is to be expected for any given welding set-up due to the influence of the travel speed on the heat input. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the shielding gas configuration had the lowest influence on the output of the model. The output from the model has demonstrated that the use of alternating shielding gases during GMAW results in a step change in the weld metal geometry. This suggests that, in the case of alternating shielding gases, an increased travel speed is required to produce a similar weld geometry to that of the conventional Ar/ 20 %CO 2 technique...|$|R
40|$|Arc welded {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in automobiles, constructions & power plants. As {{the main cause of}} weldment failure is design defect & overload, hence it is necessary to analyze the maximum stresses in the weldment. In this project experimentation is carried out on symmetrical and unsymmetrical eccentric loaded welded joint to determine the breaking stress in the weldment. The FE analysis & analytical estimation of breaking stress is also carried out to verify the experimental results. The stress distribution along weld size & <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> is evaluated and also compared with reported findings under same loading condition. Further eccentric loaded welded joint is analyzed under eccentric load by varying the gap between parent plates...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{notch stress}} approach for the fatigue strength assessment of welded structures as {{included in the}} Fatigue Design Recommendation of the IIW requires the numerical analysis of the elastic notch stress in the weld toe and weld root which is fictitiously rounded with a radius of 1 mm. The goal of this thesis work was to consider alternate meshing strategies when using the effective notch stress approach to assess the fatigue strength of load carrying partial penetration fillet-welded cruciform joints. In order to establish guidelines for modeling the joint and evaluating the results, various two-dimensional (2 D) finite element analyses were carried out by systematically varying {{the thickness of the}} plates, the weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the degree of bending, and the shape and location of the modeled effective notch. To extend the scope of this work, studies were also carried out on the influence o...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{assessment}} of welded ship structures includes high uncertainties. One {{major source of}} uncertainty is the determination of relevant local stresses based on the structural hot-spot or notch stress approach. To quantify the uncertainties and to improve the analysis guidelines, roundrobin studies were performed within the MARSTRUCT project. One recent study concerned loadcarrying fillet welds which are treated in different ways in structural stress approaches. In total, five partners participated in the work. Two structural configurations at 12 mm thick plates were analysed, i. e., double-sided lap-joints and doubler plates, each with two different weld <b>throat</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (2. 5 mm and 7 mm). After shortly describing the {{fatigue assessment}} approaches, the models of the partners and their results are described in more detail. Differences in the results are identified and conclusions drawn with respect to modelling guidelines and typical scatter of computed fatigue lives...|$|R
40|$|A {{microchannel}} separator, with 2. 7 millimeters as {{the smallest}} dimension, was tested, and a pore throat structure captured and removed liquid from a gas-liquid stream. The microchannel device was tested over a {{of gas and}} liquid flow rates ranging from 0. 0005 up to 0. 14 volume fraction of liquid. Four liquids were tested with air. The biggest factor affecting the throughput is the capacity of liquid flow through the pore throat, which is dictated by permeability, liquid viscosity, flow area, pore <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> and pressure difference across the pore throat. Typically, complete separation of gas and liquid fractions was lost when the liquid flow rate reached about 40 to 60 % of the pore throat capacity. However, this could occur over a range of 10 to 90 % utilization of pore throat capacity. Breakthrough occurs in the microchannel phase separator at conditions similar to the annular to plug flow transition of two-phase microgravity pipe flow implying that operating in the proper flow regime is crucial. Analysis indicates that the Bond number did not affect performance, supporting the premise that hydrodynamic, interfacial, and capillary forces {{are more important than}} gravity. However, the relative importance of gravity is better discerned through testing under reduced gravity conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} 32 tests on bolted T-stub {{connections}} {{made up of}} welded plates are presented and discussed. Although T-stubs {{have been used for}} many years to model the tension zone of bolted joints, the research was mainly concentrated on rolled profiles as T-stub elements. To extend this model to the case of welded plates as T-stub elements, a test programme was undertaken at the Delft University of Technology and is reported in this paper. It provides insight into the behaviour of this different type of assembly, in terms of resistance, stiffness, deformation capacity and failure modes, in particular. The key variables tested include the weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the size of the T-stub, the type and diameter of the bolts, the steel grade, the presence of transverse stiffeners and the T-stub orientation. The results show that the welding procedure is particularly important to ensure a ductile behaviour of the connection. Most of the T-stubs failed by tension fracture of the bolts after significant yielding of the flanges. However, some of the specimens have shown early damage of the plate material near the weld toe due to the effect of the welding consumable that induced premature cracking and reduced the overall deformation capacity. A solution to this problem is given by setting requirements to the weld metal to be used. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the well known local {{approach}} {{to predict the}} fatigue strength of sharply notched components, based on the analytic expressions of the local stress field as proposed in literature, is applied to welded joints in aluminium alloys in a simplified form oriented to practical applications. A particular value of the general expression of the local stress field parameter is taken into account, which the fatigue strength depends on. Then a simple model is proposed by the authors in order to estimate such a parameter, based on the calculation of a geometric (or structural) contribution to the local stress field, depending on the overall joint geometry, and a local contribution evaluated by considering a specimen with lateral V-notches characterised by the same weld toe profile and a depth proportional to the weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness.</b> Doing so, the estimation of the fatigue strength of a welded joint {{can be reduced to}} the estimation of the fatigue strength of the equivalent V-notch subjected to a remote stress equal to the structural stress (that can be regarded as a ‘hot spot’ stress). Finally a simple fatigue strength diagram, in the form recently proposed by Atzori and Lazzarin and calibrated on experimental fatigue test results, is proposed, so that one can estimate the fatigue strength of a welded joint, in terms of structural stress at a given number of cycles, {{as a function of the}} equivalent V-notch depth. By considering this diagram, the scale effect and the effectiveness of the methods to improve the fatigue strength by smoothing the weld toe radius are also taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: ISO 5817 “Arc-welded joints in steel-Guidence {{on quality}} levels for imperfections” {{is a widely}} used {{international}} standard for evaluating of the weld imperfections in arc welded joints. In this study, {{in order to see}} the differences between the quality levels given in ISO 5817, the welded joints of B, C and D levels are subjected to the same load and the differences of maximum stresses at the joints are analysed by FEM. Design/methodology/approach: The welded joints with the quality levels of the weld imperfections given in ISO 5817 are modeled by a Solidworks FEM program, and they are subjected to static loading {{in order to determine the}} maximum stresses at the cross-sections of the joints. Findings: The stress values at the welded joints generally increases from the quality level of “B” to “D”. Exceptions of this behavior are the imperfections defined as “fillet welds having the <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> greater than nominal value”, “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry fillet weld”. In these imperfections, the cross-sections carrying the force increases from “B” to “D”. Because of static force, a greater cross-section forms a smaller stress value. Thus, it must be given in the ISO 5817 whether the welded joint is subjected to a static or dynamic load. Research limitations/implications: Three dimensional models can be investigated and the effect of 3 D weld imperfections on the behavior of a more realistic model can be calculated. Practical implications: The results show that some imperfections like “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry filet weld” have less importance compared to the others. Originality/value: ISO 5817 is a worldwide used Standard for evaluating the weld imperfections. The quality levels of weld imperfections are compared with each other with FEM. The Standard includes 57 different quality levels and this paper compared all these levels with each other...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of beams {{is a very}} important factor in the study of durability of structures and structural members. The {{capacity of}} a high-strength steel I-beam made of S 960 QC was investigated in this study. The investigation included assessment of the service limits and ultimate limits of the steel beam. The thesis was done according to European standards for steel structures, Eurocode 3. An analytical method was used to determine the <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> deformation, elastic and plastic moment capacities as well as the fatigue life of the beam. The results of the analytical method were compared with those obtained by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Elastic moment capacity obtained by the analytical method was 172 kNm. FEA and the analytical method predicted the maximum lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) capacity in the range of 90 - 93 kNm and the probability of failure as a result of LTB is estimated to be 50 %. The lateral buckling capacity meant that the I-beam can carry a safe load of 300 kN instead of the initial load of 600 kN. The beam is liable to fail shortly after exceeding the elastic moment capacity. Based on results in of the different approaches, it was noted that FEA predicted higher deformation values on the load-deformation curve than the analytical results. However, both FEA and the analytical methods predicted identical results for nominal stress range and moment capacities. Fatigue life was estimated to be in the range of 53000 - 64000 cycles for bending stress range using crack propagation equation and strength-life approach. As Eurocode 3 is limited to steel grades up to S 690, results for S 960 must be verified with experimental data and appropriate design rules...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to find measurable values based on the current and voltage characteristics of the GMAW, Gas Metal Arc Welding, process that may be correlated to process parameters and/or geometrical measurements of weld beads. Such quantites may {{have the potential to}} replace or complement existing subjective and qualitative charcterisation and validation methods of the welding process. Existing characterisation methods of the performance of welding consumables consist, at least partly, of an experienced welder/engineer that uses his/her experience to evaluate the welding process. Finding other more objective and quantitative measures that correlates to aspects of the welding process may enable more systematic and efficient methods of development and validation of welding consumbles. Also, a replacement of manual welding with automated welding may further contribute to the efficiency of the methods. This work will focus on two aspects during two experiments. The first experiment performed aimed on deriving possible quantitative measurables from the I/U characteristics from welds acquired with varying voltage and wire feed speed. An automated GMAW process were used. The I/U data was then analysed in a computer software to find possible characteristic measurables, which have the potential of correlating to the welding process. Examples of calculated characteristic quantities are; amount of short-circuiting, quantities from Fourier transformation analysis and deviation in current, voltage and power. A discussion are made about how these aspects of the I/U characteristic are linked to the process and different transfer modes. The I/U characteristics analysis revealed that some of the calculated characteristic quantities showed possible trends or indications of correlations to the weld process. The Fourier transformation showed a unexpected peak in the frequency span of 300 - 900 Hz, which could be of future interest but it needs further analysis to draw any conclusions. In the second experiment, a number fillet welds were made in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and stabillity of the automated setup. These welds are also made with varying wire feed speed and voltage with an automated GMAW process. Geometry measurements were performed on the weld bead profile, in terms of <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> leg length, penetration, etc. The result from the geometrical measurements and their correlation with the input parameters are shown to be in good agreement with theory and the automated setup being promising as a standard method for consumable characterisation...|$|R

It is observed from the analysis that maximum displacement, support reactions, support moments, stresses and bending moments in plates due to seismic loading on a hyperbolic cooling tower is continuous function of geometry (top diameter, throat diameter and height). earthquake zone plays the important role in analysis. So from the above work it can be observed that 300 <b>thickness,</b> <b>throat</b> diameter 64 m and height 150 m is much efficient among all but if height is mandatory to extent than height should not be more than 159 m (height taken from actual work). and 170 m height is critical...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} {{second throat}} supersonic diffuser {{has been tested}} in the GALCIT 2 - 1 / 2 inch supersonic wind tunnel at Mach numbers of 2. 60 and 3. 33. The theoretical minimum area relation for starting a supersonic tunnel has been checked at the two Mach numbers, and the amount by which {{the height of the}} second throat may be reduced after the tunnel has been started was determined. Minimum compression ratios for the starting and reduced second throat conditions have been determined and compared with those previously found here and theoretically estimated by Crocco. Effect of nozzle surface roughness on supersonic flow is noted, and Schlieren photographs representing the flow in a variety of conditions are presented. A series of Schlieren photographs shows the flow in the second throat at progressively greater amounts of area reduction. The <b>theoretical</b> minimum second <b>throat</b> area relation was found to predict the second throat size for starting within 3 percent at both Mach numbers, being conservative by that amount in both cases. Only about 1 / 3 of the theoretically predicted reduction of second throat area after starting was realized at both Mach numbers before separation of the boundary layer broke down flow throughout the nozzle. Minimum compression ratios were reduced some 9 and 6 percent for Mach numbers 2. 60 and 3. 33 respectively. These decreases, though not as large as anticipated, nevertheless have the lowest compression ratios ever measured in the GALCIT tunnel, ratios less than Crocco's estimate, heretofore never realized. Transition, though not occurring by means of a normal shock wave, was found to be stable a few inches downstream of the second throat. ...|$|R
