5|$|In 2015, a {{documentary}} film Among <b>the</b> <b>Believers</b> was released. It was filmed {{over a five-year}} period in which Aziz and his students were interviewed. The documentary portrayed the periods before, during and after the siege of the Lal Masjid.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by <b>the</b> <b>believers.</b> The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|The Malé Friday Mosque is {{oriented}} west. Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray. Devotees enter the mosque from the Islamic Centre, climbing several marble steps {{leading to the}} mosque balcony. The prayer hall below has a burgundy-coloured carpet, patterned with images resembling hot-water bottles which demarcate spaces for <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> offering prayers. The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers.|$|E

30|$|Consider {{a domain}} {{involving}} two agents, {{which we call}} <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> and <b>the</b> manipulator. <b>The</b> <b>believer</b> holds some beliefs {{about the state of}} the world, including an initial belief set as well as a mechanism for revision. The manipulator would like to make <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> believe some distinguished formula ψ is true. The way the manipulator tries to bring this about is by specifying a sequence of formulas to be provided to <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> as information to be incorporated. Hence, the manipulator is trying to provide information that causes <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> to perform a suitable sequence of revisions. Note that the manipulator is not providing an argument in the sense of argumentation theory; each piece of information is treated as an independent item by <b>the</b> <b>believer,</b> with no justification. Informally, we describe the manipulator to be “sending messages” to <b>the</b> <b>believer.</b> We assume that <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> receives all messages, but the receiver is not aware of the sender or the sender’s goals. A preliminary version of the framework presented in this section appeared in [24].|$|R
5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in the unity of <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

50|$|Between 2003-2015, <b>The</b> <b>Believer</b> was {{published}} by McSweeney’s, the independent press founded in 1998 by Dave Eggers.

5000|$|Tustari {{maintained}} that ultimately ... {{it became clear}} to the recollector that the true agent of recollection was not <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> engaged in recollection but God Himself, who commemorated Himself in the heart of <b>the</b> <b>believer.</b> This realisation of God's control over the heart led <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> to <b>the</b> state of complete trust in the Divine.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} mihrab, {{uncovered in}} 1933, has a semi-dome above {{it with a}} marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

25|$|Sanctification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} in which God makes <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people. The good works accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary outworking of <b>the</b> <b>believer's</b> salvation, though they do not cause <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> to be saved. Sanctification, like justification, is by faith, because doing good works is simply living as the son of God one has become.|$|R

50|$|Ellen White in her {{writings}} {{does not}} link perfection {{to something that}} happens from <b>the</b> <b>believer,</b> but with what God does for <b>the</b> <b>believer</b> through Christ, and those who try to trust in their own righteousness cannot understand how it comes through Christ.|$|R

25|$|Adventists {{teach that}} the scapegoat, or Azazel, {{is a symbol}} for Satan.

25|$|Sanctifying Grace is {{that grace}} of God which sustains <b>the</b> <b>believers</b> in the journey toward Christian Perfection: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love {{of our neighbors}} as ourselves.

50|$|For the {{majority}} of Baptists, Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water {{in the name of}} the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
