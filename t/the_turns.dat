5|$|Bolt was {{a member}} of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4×100 metres relay. Jamaica set a {{national}} record of 37.89 s. Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving him more driving power on the track.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on <b>the</b> <b>turns,</b> breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course to get to know <b>the</b> <b>turns.</b> In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|By the 84th lap, Kyle Busch's {{lead was}} {{half a second}} from Kurt Busch. Two laps later, Sam Hornish, Jr. {{collided}} with the wall and suffered three flat tires, prompting the second caution. During the caution, most of the leaders made pit stops. Kyle Busch remained the leader after the pit stops and maintained it at the lap 91 restart. Montoya moved into ninth, as Stewart passed Reutimann for third on the same. Two laps later, Jeff Gordon had moved up into ninth. Sunlight came off the track surface by lap 99, causing track temperatures to cool and drivers were reminded by their crew chiefs to drive cautiously in <b>the</b> <b>turns.</b> Martin moved into the thirteenth position by lap 102. Ambrose had moved into third nine laps later. On lap 113, Johnson rejoined the track, albeit without his car's rear bumper. Kyle Busch had built up a {{one and a half}} second lead over Kurt Busch by lap 116. Johnson drove to pit road to resolve tire rubbing problems two laps later.|$|E

5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} <b>the</b> desired <b>turn</b> direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state <b>turn.</b> <b>The</b> sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> but may remain opposite to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> direction. <b>The</b> actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to increase lean and decrease radius, then into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} resurfacing, {{there was some}} dispute as to the {{accuracy}} of the measurement. In the 1980s, ESPN often claimed <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> were banked at 35 degrees during television telecast of events at the track. In an interview with Stock Car Racings Larry Cothren, driver Ryan Newman openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, and found that <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A Camping World Truck Series open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22–27degrees, in a variable banking configuration.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turn</b> {{and slip}} {{indicator}} can {{be referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> and bank indicator, although the instrument does not respond directly to bank angle. Neither does <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> coordinator, but it does respond to roll rate, which enables it to respond more quickly to the start of a turn.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the folding}} of overall proteins, <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> may {{originate}} not in <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region {{but in the}} C-strand of <b>the</b> beta-hairpin. This <b>turn</b> then propagates through the C-strand (the beta strand leading to C-terminus) until it reaches <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region. Sometimes <b>the</b> residue interactions leading up to <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> region are too strong, causing reverse propagation. However, once <b>the</b> native <b>turn</b> does form, interactions between prolines and tryptophan residues (seen in image at right) in the region help to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> preventing [...] "roll back" [...] or dissolution.|$|R

25|$|Entering <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> first {{require a}} 90° turn {{where the road}} remains paved with concrete. The road becomes {{cobblestone}} after the second turn, a 180° turn. The third turn, also a 180° turn, is housed completely by the original stone wall. Finally, the last turn is out onto Hackensack Plank Road which if going southbound, requires another 180° turn and ends the cobblestone portion of the street. The one-way hairpin road is about 440ft. when traveled along the centerline path.|$|E
25|$|Texas Motor Speedway was {{originally}} designed with a dual-banking layout. The steep 24° banking on top would accommodate NASCAR races. A secondary 8° banking below {{was designed for}} the faster open-wheel machines. While the track was under construction, CART had expressed interest in holding a race at the facility. But after closer examination of the unusual dual-banking system, decided it was not feasible. The secondary banking design was ultimately deemed a failure, and in 1998, <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> were reconfigured. The dual banking was removed {{in favor of a}} larger apron, and after unrelated difficulties during the NASCAR events, the turn transitions were corrected.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{regulators}} called voltage stabilizers or tap-changers, {{have also}} been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage {{is not in the}} acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage ("hunting") as it varies by an acceptably small amount.|$|E
40|$|We made <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> {{trial of}} "KAKUYO MARU", which was {{equipped}} with two engines, two propellers and two rudders, to find out <b>the</b> steady <b>turning</b> diameter, <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> time and <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> speed reduction ratio. The results of trial are stated below. 　 1) The size of steady turning diameter depended on the rudder angle and was little affected by <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> speed. 　 2) <b>The</b> ratio of <b>the</b> steady <b>turning</b> diameter to <b>the</b> ship length between perpendiculars (D/L) was inversely proportional to the rudder angle, and its regression formula was expressed as y= 20. 361 x-^l. OOOl. 　 3) <b>The</b> <b>turning</b> time was inversely proportional to the rudder angle and <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> speed, and its regression formuia at 10 degrees of rudder angle was expressed as y_ 1 O°= 453. l 7 x^-O. 6797. 　 4) <b>The</b> <b>turning</b> speed reduction ratio changed {{in proportion to the}} rudder angle and was almost constant even though <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> speed changed. 　 5) In comparing the measured D/L values by turning speed and rudder angle with Sugihara's nomogram values, the error between measured values and nomogram values was 13. 6 % at most. Accordingly, Sugihara's nomogram can be applied to a twin-engine, twin-propeller, and twin-rudder ship also. 　 6) As for the effect of ship's bottom fouling on <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> diameter, <b>the</b> steady <b>turning</b> diameter varied inversely with the period elapsed from the last bottom cleaning in a dock, and its regression formula at 10 and 20 degrees of rudder angle were expressed as y_ 1 O°=- 0. 6313 x^ 2 - 0. 7471 x + 394. 8 and Y_ 20 °=- 0. 6529 x^ 2 + 4. 2921 x+ 189. 4 respectively...|$|R

25|$|A man {{overboard}} rescue turn is a sailing maneuver usually implemented {{immediately upon}} learning {{of a man}} overboard. To maneuver closer to the person's location, implementations of the principles described are: <b>the</b> quick <b>turn</b> (also known as the Q-turn or <b>the</b> figure eight <b>turn),</b> <b>the</b> Anderson <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> Williamson <b>turn,</b> and <b>the</b> Scharnow <b>turn.</b>|$|R
25|$|On the men's side, rain {{made the}} race {{conditions}} difficult. Reigning World Champion Javier Gómez incurred a fall during the bike leg, {{causing him to}} fall off {{the pace of the}} race pack for the final 10 kilometres of the bike. Gómez managed to catch the lead group; however, Jonathan Brownlee, Alistair Brownlee, Sven Riederer, Brendan Sexton and David Hauss were in front of him. Alistair fell on one of <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> during the run before falling off the pace and out of contention. Gómez eventually passed the leaders, with only Jonathan keeping pace with him for a short while. Gómez finished first with Jonathan second and Riederer third. Alistair, the 2009 World champion, finished 29th.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a dozen}} major freeways that {{crisscross}} the region. California's first freeway was the California State Route 110, {{also known}} as the Pasadena Freeway or the Arroyo Seco Parkway. It opened on January 1, 1940 and links downtown Los Angeles to downtown Pasadena. From Chavez Ravine north to Pasadena can be quite dangerous because there is no shoulder, the lanes are narrow, <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> are sharp (and not always properly banked), and the ramps are quite short and offer little room for acceleration to freeway speed; all of this is because the freeway was designed for much slower cars of a different era and much less traffic volume than exists today. Commercial vehicles over 6,000 pounds are prohibited from using this freeway. More recent freeways are straighter, wider, and allow for higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Island Number Ten was an {{engagement}} at the New Madrid or Kentucky Bend on the Mississippi River during the American Civil War, lasting from February 28 to April 8, 1862. The position, an island {{at the base}} of a tight double turn in the course of the river, was held by the Confederates from the early days of the war. It was an excellent site to impede Union efforts to invade the South by the river, as ships had to approach the island bows on and then slow to make <b>the</b> <b>turns.</b> For the defenders, however, it had an innate weakness in that it depended on a single road for supplies and reinforcements. If an enemy force managed to cut that road, the garrison would be isolated and eventually be forced to surrender.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{a wave of}} {{the hand}} in the {{direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> or a flashing of headlights by the driver going straight will indicate permission for the left-turning driver to execute <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> Conversely, <b>the</b> driver navigating <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> may attempt to signal the other driver for permission to do so, with similar hand motions or headlight signals. Furthermore, simply a delay by the straight-bound car can often initiate the signal, and give the left turner time to go and make <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially in large intersections.|$|R
50|$|The pivot on the {{hindquarters}} (or spin) {{is commonly}} seen in reining, and asks {{the horse to}} ground the inside hind leg and pivot forelegs around that point. <b>The</b> <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> center asks <b>the</b> horse to <b>turn</b> around an imaginary pivot point located {{at the center of}} his barrel. The horse bends in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> moving his forehand in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> and his hind end in the opposite direction. This allows <b>the</b> horse to <b>turn</b> in a very confined area. Neither movement is practiced today in dressage (although <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> center used to be a training movement in the 18th century).|$|R

25|$|After {{the race}} started, Alonso {{was the first}} driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race {{at the back of}} the field. He had put in a light fuel load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 44 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US-283 in the Quartz Mountains, just northwest of Byrd Mountain in Greer County. From the terminus, SH-44 heads northeast, crossing the North Fork of the Red River into Kiowa County. Just after crossing the river, the highway spawns its only spur route, SH-44A. The road continues through the Quartz Mountains, passing in between Williams Peak and King Mountain. The route then follows {{the south shore}} of Lake Altus-Lugert, passing between the lakeshore and Mount Lugert. As SH-44 leaves the mountains, it passes through the unincorporated place of Lugert, from which both the lake and the mountain get their name. The highway then heads north-northwest until it reaches SH-9 {{on the east side}} of Lone Wolf. It follows SH-9 to the east before splitting off along a due north course. The highway curves northeast to cross Elm Creek, <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> back to the north just after crossing into Washita County.|$|E
25|$|One {{proposal}} for a change was made in 1915 by Thomas Kennard Thomson, an engineer from Buffalo, New York who settled in New York City after making a career in Canada and the United States as a bridge and railway engineer. Thompson opened an office in New York in 1893 which concentrated on the foundations of skyscrapers and underwater caissons used for building bridges. He {{was involved in the}} construction of the Singer Tower, the Manhattan Municipal Building and the Mutual Life Building. His 1915 plan was aimed at relieving congestion at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Thompson proposed to run 42nd Street under Fifth Avenue, and to add a mid-block street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues from 42nd to 43rd Streets to permit <b>the</b> <b>turns</b> that the tunneling would prevent. Why this plan would not simply shift the congestion to the new mid-block connector is not clear. In modern actions to relieve congestion, changes are generally made within the existing right-of-way, therefore without the need to condemn and purchase very expensive Manhattan property.|$|E
