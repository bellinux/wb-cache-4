They considered much of the land added to the Roman Empire in Parthian and early Sasanian times <b>to</b> <b>rightfully</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> the Persian sphere. Everett Wheeler argues that [...] "the Sassanids, administratively more centralized than the Parthians, formally organized defense of their territory, although they lacked a standing army until Khosrau I". In general, the Romans regarded the Sasanians as a more serious threat than the Parthians, while the Sasanians regarded the Roman Empire as the enemy par excellence.|$|R

In the Free State (second highest incidence of HIV/AIDS among the provinces), the Welkom-Goldfields area may for various reasons be singled out as a high risk area for HIV/AIDS which should receive priority attention in attempts to combat the disease. It is suggested that a Youth Multi-function Centre would place youth reproductive {{health care in the}} broader development and life skills arena - where it could be thought <b>to</b> <b>rightfully</b> <b>belong.</b> The objectives of the paper are to depict the rationale for a Youth Multi-function Centre, to broadly conceptualise a Youth Multi-function Centre, and to report on the process and methodology followed in an attempt to actually establish such a centre in Thabong/Welkom...|$|R
50|$|Mayo {{was born}} in Ridgway, Pennsylvania, to James Henry and Harriet Elizabeth (Ingraham) Mayo, and was educated privately. Shortly after graduation, she started work as a {{researcher}} and historian by helping Oswald Garrison Villard of the New York Evening Post (whose father owned the newspaper) prepare his book John Brown 1800-1859: A Biography Fifty Years After, a biography of John Brown, {{which was published in}} 1910. Villard was a founder of the American Anti-Imperialist League and an officer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He influenced Mayo to become a social reformer. Mayo also {{became a member of the}} Mayflower Society and had cordial links with the Daughters of the American Revolution. The latter were hostile to non-white immigration to the United States at the time, believing the country <b>to</b> <b>rightfully</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> white Anglo Saxons of British descent and Protestant faith.|$|R
50|$|Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{arrived in}} September {{to work on}} the campaign. They created a storm of {{controversy}} by accepting help during the last {{two and a half weeks}} of the campaign from George Francis Train, a Democrat, a wealthy businessman and a flamboyant speaker who supported women's rights.Train was a political maverick who had attended the Democratic convention during the presidential election year of 1864 but then campaigned vigorously for the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln. By 1867 he was promoting himself as an independent candidate for president.Train was also a racist who openly disparaged the integrity and intelligence of African Americans, supporting women's suffrage partly in the belief that the votes of women would help contain the political power of blacks.The usual procedure was for Anthony to speak first, declaring that the ability <b>to</b> vote <b>rightfully</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> both women and blacks. Train would speak next, declaring that it would be an outrage for blacks to vote but not women also.|$|R

Train would speak next, declaring that it would be an outrage for blacks to vote but not women also.The willingness of Anthony and Stanton to work with Train alienated many AERA members. This was due partly to Train's attitude toward blacks and partly to his harsh attacks on the Republican Party: he made no secret of his desire to blemish its progressive image and create splits within it. Many reformers were loyal to the national Republican Party, which had provided political leadership for the elimination of slavery and was still in the difficult process of consolidating that victory.|$|R
6000|$|... (M98) The same {{vigorous}} {{currents of}} national vitality {{that led to}} new endeavours {{for the education of}} the poor, had drawn men to consider the horrid chaos, the waste, and the abuses in the provision of education for the directing classes beyond the poor. Grave problems of more kinds than one came into view. The question, What is education? was nearly as hard to answer as the question of which we have seen so much, What is a church? The rival claims of old classical training and the acquisition of modern knowledge were matters of vivacious contest. What is the true place of classical learning in the human culture of our own age? Misused charitable trusts, and endowments perverted by the fluctuations of time, by lethargy, by selfishness, from the objects of pious founders, touched wakeful jealousies in the privileged sect, and called into action that adoration of the principle of property which insists upon applying all the rules of individual ownership <b>to</b> what <b>rightfully</b> <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> the community. Local interests were very sensitive, and they were multitudinous. The battle was severely fought, and it extended over several years, while commission upon commission explored the issues.|$|R

They uncovered tons of fossils {{from at least}} 175 different species of Oligocene life. The fossils {{were taken to the}} South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City. Among the mammal discoveries were the remains of rhinoceroses, tapirs, three-toed horses, pig-like animals, and rodents. The team also uncovered some bird fossils, which are very rare. One of these was a fossil egg, which author Marian Murray has called [...] "the best find" [...] of the entire expedition. Only a few plant specimens were discovered, but these included fossil hackberry seeds and petrified wood. Some of the fossils were so precariously located that the excavators had to use block and tackle to lower the fossils down from the tops of [...] "slender pinnacles". The fossils were preserved in channel sandstones that had received little scientific attention prior to the expedition. In June 1947 the South Dakota School of mines sent another expedition into the Badlands. They uncovered a wide variety of fossils preserved in the Oligocene White River Formation. Among the creatures discovered were rhinoceroses, saber teeth, giant pig-like animals, Protoceros, tapirs, horses and more. In 1990, Sue Hendrickson discovered a new specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex that would later be nicknamed in her honor. The specimen made headlines when a dispute over ownership rights raged for more than five years. [...] "Sue" [...] was determined <b>to</b> <b>rightfully</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> the owner of the property it was found on.

50|$|Starting in the 1670s, Louis XIV {{established}} the so-called Chambers of Reunion, courts in which judges would determine whether certain Habsburg territories <b>belonged</b> <b>rightfully</b> <b>to</b> France.

Through this, he concluded that the strategically important imperial city of Strassburg {{should have gone to}} France in 1648. In September 1681, French troops occupied the city, which was at once strongly fortified. As the imperial armies were then busy fighting the Ottoman Empire, they could not do anything about this for a number of years. The basic aim of Louis' foreign policy was to give France more easily defensible borders, and to eliminate weak spots (Strassburg had often been used by the Habsburgs as a gateway into France).|$|R
