60|$|Lenora's voice {{suddenly}} grew steady. She <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> in her <b>place</b> {{and faced}} her companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He's {{been blessed}} with the most {{surprising}} number of unmarried uncles and aunts that ever a man had. He's rather fond of me, and likes the idea of my being in Parliament. I think I shall hint {{to him that he}} must pay for the idea. Here we are. Will you come and take a <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> the <b>place</b> before dinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Valentin <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> in his <b>place</b> {{and looked}} a while at Newman, {{wrinkling}} {{his forehead and}} rubbing his knees. [...] "Vous parlez d'or. But she has wonderfully pretty arms. Would you believe I didn't know it till this evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; supposed. Nobody {{cares about}} their French lessons. They make no {{difference}} in your place in the school, and so no one takes the trouble to grind at them. Well, come along, let us take a <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> the <b>place</b> for an hour before we start." [...] And the two boys and Madge, who was a year their junior, went out through the French window into the garden.|$|R
60|$|He saw the stoker, after a furtive {{glance at}} him, {{deliberately}} <b>turn</b> the cigar <b>round,</b> <b>place</b> the lighted end in his mouth, inhale strongly, and blow {{a torrent of}} sparks and smoke out of his nose. His firelit face as he did this expressed a diabolical relief. Then very hastily he reversed the cigar again, and <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> {{to look at the}} Author. The Author turned slowly towards him.|$|R
5000|$|For most {{conspicuous}} bravery when {{in charge of}} a Stokes gun in trenches which were being heavily shelled. Suddenly one of the fly-off levers of a Stokes shell came off and fired the shell in the emplacement. Private Butler picked up the shell and jumped to the entrance of the emplacement, which at that moment a party of infantry were passing. He shouted to them to hurry past as the shell was going off, and <b>turning</b> <b>round,</b> <b>placed</b> himself between the party of men and the live shell and so held it till they were out of danger. He then threw the shell on to the parados, and took cover {{in the bottom of the}} trench. The shell exploded almost on leaving his hand, greatly damaging the trench. By extreme good luck Private Butler was contused only. Undoubtedly his great presence of mind and disregard of his own life saved the lives of the officer and men in the emplacement and the party which was passing at the time.|$|R
60|$|On {{leaving the}} office the first {{precaution}} {{to be observed}} was to abstain from attracting attention by stopping to look about me. I walked towards one of the quietest of the large squares on the north of Holborn, then suddenly stopped and <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> at a <b>place</b> where {{a long stretch of}} pavement was left behind me.|$|R
6000|$|M. Nioche stood staring, with {{a fallen}} jaw, not daring {{to put out}} his hand. The lady, who sat facing him, <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> in her <b>place</b> and glanced upward with a {{spirited}} toss of her head, displaying the agreeable features of his daughter. She looked at Newman sharply, {{to see how he}} was looking at her, then--I don't know what she discovered--she said graciously, [...] "How d' ye do, monsieur? won't you come into our little corner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Lord Keeper, who {{observed}} the animal's demeanour, {{was aware that}} he was about to become mischievous, and, drawing his daughter's arm under his own, began to walk fast along the avenue, in hopes to get out of his sight and his reach. This was the most injudicious course he could have adopted, for, encouraged by the appearance of flight, the bull began to pursue them at full speed. Assailed by a danger so imminent, firmer courage than that of the Lord Keeper might have given way. But paternal tenderness, [...] "love strong as death," [...] sustained him. He continued to support and drag onward his daughter, until her fears altogether depriving her of the power of flight, she sunk down by his side; and when he could no longer assist her to escape, he <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> and <b>placed</b> himself betwixt her and the raging animal, which, advancing in full career, its brutal fury enhanced by the rapidity of the pursuit, was now within a few yards of them. The Lord Keeper had no weapons; his age and gravity dispensed even with the usual appendage of a walking sword--could such appendage have availed him anything.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>round,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> thou Scottish youth,Or loud thy sire shall mourn;For if thou touchest Norway's strand,Thou never shall return.|$|R

60|$|Having {{made her}} prudent, high-minded speech, she <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> and slept; and poor Linda also <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> and bedewed her pillow. She no longer panted {{to tell her}} sister of Alaric's love.|$|R
50|$|When {{the legs}} of a loop are brought {{together}} and crossed the rope has taken a turn. One distinguishes between single <b>turn,</b> <b>round</b> <b>turn,</b> and two <b>round</b> <b>turns</b> depending {{on the number of}} revolutions around an object. The benefit of <b>round</b> <b>turns</b> is best understood from the capstan equation.|$|R
6000|$|They {{moved forward}} quickly and silently {{until they were}} close to the group, then they dashed forward. As the startled attendants <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> the troopers fell upon them, and with heavy blows from their fists knocked them to the ground like nine-pins. The bishop <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> and shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Turn <b>round,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>round,</b> proud Margaret! <b>Turn</b> ye <b>round,</b> {{and look}} on me, Thou hast killed a true knight under trust, And his ghost now links on with thee." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>round</b> in {{my chair}} and {{regarded}} Mabane reproachfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I help {{what other}} people have done? Things would not come right if I were to <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> now and declare that I would not marry Mr. Grandcourt." [...] And such <b>turning</b> <b>round</b> {{was out of the}} question. The horses in the chariot she had mounted were going at full speed.|$|R
50|$|To tie the hitch {{around a}} pole, begin by passing the working end a half <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> the pole. Next, pass a half <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> the {{standing}} part. Then, pass a half <b>turn</b> <b>round</b> both the working {{end and the}} standing part, above the first turn (i.e. closer to the pole). Finally, push a bight of the working end {{through the middle of}} the hitch - between the two half turns, and between the standing part and the working end. Pull on the standing part to tighten, if necessary sliding the hitch snugly up against the pole.|$|R
60|$|He <b>turned</b> <b>round,</b> {{and saw a}} {{policeman}} with a bull's-eye lantern.|$|R

6000|$|... "He's a {{handsome}} young man, now!" [...] exclaimed her companion one evening as the navvies passed. And all three <b>turned</b> <b>round,</b> to find all three <b>turning</b> <b>round.</b> Alvina laughed, and made eyes. At that moment she would cheerfully have gone along with the navvy. She was getting so tired of Mr. May's quiet prance.|$|R
