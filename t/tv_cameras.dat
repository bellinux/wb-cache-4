In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV.

5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. <b>TV</b> <b>cameras</b> showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining.

Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield.
