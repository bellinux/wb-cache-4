Discussions between the three of <b>them,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's The Heather Field and Yeats's The Countess Cathleen.|$|E

5|$|Royal Rumble (1993) was {{the sixth}} annual Royal Rumble {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event {{produced by the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on January 24, 1993 at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California. The main event was a Royal Rumble match, a battle royal in which two wrestlers started the match in the ring; every two minutes, another wrestler joined. In total, thirty wrestlers competed to eliminate their competitors by throwing <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top rope of the wrestling ring onto the arena floor. Yokozuna won the match and was awarded an opportunity to wrestle for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IX. Bret Hart also retained his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Razor Ramon, and Shawn Michaels successfully defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty.|$|E

In 1988, before the center's dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that {{the arrangement of the}} windows at night looked like a Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the show {{with a duration of}} 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top rope and down to the floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and down to the floor.|$|E

5|$|The {{defense of}} Lima Site 85 was {{assigned}} to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men. In {{the first week of}} 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, U.S. technicians dismantled the charges and threw <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cliff.|$|E
5|$|A Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to {{determine}} the number contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was held at Hard Justice. The match was announced on the April 29 episode of Impact! by DOA Rhodes. In a Gauntlet for the Gold, two wrestlers start the bout, with more entering at time intervals, in which the point is to eliminate the opponent by throwing <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top rope and to the floor. When the match is down to two wrestlers, a standard match is held, with the winner being the one to gain the pinfall or submission. On the May 6 episode of Impact!, Abyss was announced as a participant in the match. TNA held a Ten-Man Gauntlet on the May 13 episode of Impact! {{to determine}} the first and final entrants in the match, with the first eliminated in the match entering first while the winner being the last entrant. Abyss, Bobby Roode, David Young, A-1, Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Lance Hoyt, Michael Shane, Trytan, and Apolo all participated in the bout, with Roode being the first eliminated and Abyss winning the contest.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved <b>them.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E

5|$|The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and {{the debut}} of the X Division TerrorDome were {{promoted}} as featured matches for the Sacrifice undercard. The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal was announced by Cornette on the April24 episode of Impact!. The rules of the contest involved two stages: a standard battle royal in which competitors fought to eliminate wrestlers by throwing <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top rope and a ladder match in which the final two wrestles fought to retrieve a contract that had been hung above the ring. An added stipulation to the bout was that the loser's head would be shaved and the winner would earn a TNA Women's Knockout Championship match. On the May8 episode of Impact!, Gail Kim won a Ten-Woman Clippers on a Pole match that granted her immunity from having her head shaven if she lost at the event. During the April24 episode of Impact!, TNA announced plans to introduce a new match type in the near future. The TerrorDome was announced on the May1 episode of Impact!, and the participants were announced on the May8 episode. The participants were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E
5|$|While {{many of the}} failings in Australian command {{arrangements}} {{evident from}} {{the initial stages of}} the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures, future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without <b>them.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry.|$|E
