25|$|The Shihabs succeeded the Maans in 1697 {{after the}} Battle of Ain Dara, {{a battle that}} {{changed the face of}} Lebanon back <b>then,</b> <b>where</b> a clash between two Druze clans broke up: the Qaysis and the Yemenis. The Druze Qaysis, led back then by Ahmad Shihab, won and {{expelled}} the Yemenis from Lebanon to Syria. This has led to an enormous decrease to the Druze population in Mount-Lebanon, who were a majority back then and helped the Christians overcome the Druze demographically. This Qaysi 'victory' gave the Shihab, who were Qaysis themselves and the allies of Lebanon, the rule over Mount-Lebanon. The Druze overlords voted for the Shihabs to rule Mount Lebanon and the Chouf by the threat of the Ottoman Empire who wanted the Sunnis to rule Lebanon. The Shihabs originally lived in the Hawran region of southwestern Syria and settled in Wadi al-Taym in southern Lebanon. The most prominent among them was Bashir Shihab II. His ability as a statesman was first tested in 1799, when Napoleon besieged Acre, a well-fortified coastal city in Palestine, about forty kilometers south of Tyre. Both Napoleon and Al Jazzar, the governor of Acre, requested assistance from the Shihab leader; Bashir, however, remained neutral, declining to assist either combatant. Unable to conquer Acre, Napoleon returned to Egypt, and the death of Al Jazzar in 1804 removed Bashir's principal opponent in the area. The Shihabs were originally a Sunni Muslim family, but had converted to Christianity.|$|E

25|$|The {{first edition}} of World Twenty20 World Championship, which was hosted by South Africa. Sri Lanka played under the {{captaincy}} of Mahela Jayawardena in Group C along with New Zealand and Kenya. First match was against Kenyans, which was a World Record breaking match. Kenya won the toss and gave Lankans to bat first. Tharanga and Jayasuriya started the innings, but Tharanga was bowled by Thomas Odoyo. Then Sangakkara joined Jayasuriya. Sangakkara bowled by Jimmy Kamande when the score was 94 in 9 overs. The show time begun <b>then,</b> <b>where</b> Jayasuriya and Jayawardena scored unfaithfully for all the bowlers. Jayasuriya caught {{when he was in}} magnificent 88, with 11 fours and 4 sixes. Jayawardena on the other hand, played a brilliant innings, scored 65 from just 27 ball when until he was lbw. Sri Lanka was 215/6 in 18 overs, when Jehan Mubarak came to the crease. He scored an unbelievable sixes down the ground to Nehemiah Odhiambo and Peter Ongondo. He smashed 46 off 13 balls with 3 fours and 5 huge sixes. The strike rate of this innings was 353.84. Sri Lanka finished with 260/6, which recorded highest T20 total in any top-level Twenty20 match. Kenyans came to bat with chasing the huge task. Vaas immediately made a breakthrough, dismissing opening batsman Maurice Ouma for a duck. Kenya never recovered, and were reduced to just 88 runs in the 20th over as Sri Lanka dismissed their batsmen cheaply. The win, by 172 runs, is the largest margin of victory in a Twenty20 internationals.|$|E
