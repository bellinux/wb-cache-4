50|$|Ammerlaan's {{work does}} {{not try to}} provoke emotions. The {{emphasis}} lies in showing barely perceptible changes. Another series of colorful paintings are embroidered with thin, shiny, sometimes <b>fluorescent</b> <b>threads,</b> which frame and structure the surface. The fragile threads change color with changing light and sometimes seem to fade into the background. The geometrical patterns of thread create a permeable fence, like a web or weave which you can seemingly get stuck in or hold onto. These works are illuminating and seductive though ultimately deny the viewer access.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Age {{dynamics}} of humoral immunity was studied in healthy children, i. e., 11 newborns, 33 infants of 4 to 8 months, 32 children of 1 to 2 years old,, 17 children of 4 to 5 years old, 25 children of 6 to 8 years old, 15 children of 9 to 11 years old, and 28 adolescents of 14 to 16 years old. Evaluation of membrane receptors on B cells {{was performed by}} means of <b>three-colour</b> <b>fluorescent</b> label and allowed of characterizing B 1 subpopulations (CD 19 +CD 5 +CD 27 -), naпve B 2 cells (CD 19 +CD 5 -CD 27 -), and B 2 memory cells (CD 19 +CD 5 -CD 27 +). B 1 cells {{have been shown to}} dominate in blood of newborns and younger children (up to 5 years old). By the contrary, B 2 memory cells were nearly undetectable in newborns, and exceeded 20 % in adolescents (by 15 years old). Meanwhile, it has been revealed that the amounts of IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses did progressively increase with age, whereas IgG 2 remained decreased to 50 % of adult values for a long time, and reached them by 11 years and later. We suggest that the age {{dynamics of}} IgG subclasses is connected with age-dependent changes in B cell subpopulations. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells produce {{multiple}} cytokines {{with potential}} immune regulatory roles. We standardised a whole-blood flow cytometry method to visualise intracellular cytokine production by NK cells {{for the study}} of NK cell biology and for clinical monitoring. METHODS: With a <b>three-colour</b> <b>fluorescent</b> labelling technique, specific cytokine production by NK or T cells was visualised directly in whole blood in the same sample after stimulation by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) and ionomycin and by electronically gating on the CD 3 -ve/CD 56 +ve NK population or on the CD 3 +/CD 56 + NK-T-cell population. RESULTS: Detectable levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) or IL- 4 were easily observed in NK cells. The visualisation of the cytokine production by NK cells was dependent on the addition of a Golgi transport inhibitor, Brefeldin A. Other known stimuli for NK cells (IL- 2 and CD 16 monoclonal antibody and incubation with K 562, the NK-sensitive cell line) promoted IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in NK cells to a lesser extent than did PMA and ionomycin stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: This whole-blood flow cytometric assay appears to be an useful and easy method to examine cytokine production by NK cells and/or by CD 3 +CD 56 + NK-T lymphocytes in patients with relevant diseases...|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{molecular}} identities of {{adult stem cells}} requires technologies for sensitive transcript detection in tissues. In mouse intestinal crypts, lineage-tracing studies indicated that different genes uniquely mark spatially distinct stem-cell populations, residing either at crypt bases or at position + 4, but {{a detailed analysis of}} their spatial co-expression has not been feasible. Here we apply <b>three-colour</b> single-molecule <b>fluorescent</b> in situ hybridization to study a comprehensive panel of intestinal stem-cell markers during homeostasis, ageing and regeneration. We find that the expression of all markers overlaps at crypt-base cells. This co-expression includes Lgr 5, Bmi 1 and mTert, genes previously suggested to mark distinct stem cells. Strikingly, Dcamkl 1 tuft cells, distributed throughout the crypt axis, co-express Lgr 5 and other stem-cell markers that are otherwise confined to crypt bases. We also detect significant changes in the expression of some of the markers following irradiation, indicating their potential role in the regeneration process. Our approach can enable the sensitive detection of putative stem cells in other tissues and in tumours, guiding complementary functional studies to evaluate their stem-cell properties. available in PMC 2012 July 1.

25|$|As of July 2015, the Philippine Passport {{is printed}} in Asian Productivity Organization or APO Productions under the Presidential Communications Group. On August 15, 2016, the new {{generation}} e-passport was released by the Department of Foreign Affairs with advanced security features such as the upgraded microchip to capture the personal data of the applicant, invisible ultraviolet (UV) <b>fluorescent</b> ink and <b>thread,</b> and elaborate design when subject to UV light. Security inks were also used to print the passports to prevent forgery. These inks include intaglio, which are visible inks that have a distinct ridged feel and ultraviolet ink that appears when exposed to infrared lights. Other security features include watermarks, perforated passport numbering, embedded security fibers, among others. Aside from making the new e-passport tamper-proof, each leaf of the 44-page document depicts Philippine artifacts, cultural icons, historic places, renowned tourist destinations, and even lyrics of the national anthem.|$|R
40|$|The FeCl 3 -catalysed arylation of C 60 F 18 gives tri-substituted {{compounds}} C 60 F 15 Ar 3, where Ar=phenyl, 4 -tolyl, 4 -methoxyphenyl, 4 -phenoxyphenyl, 4 -chlorophenyl, 3, 4 -dichlorophenyl, 2 -biphylenyl and 2 -fluorenyl, {{together with}} some bis- and mono-substituted product. Bis-substitution was achieved with biphenylene and fluoranthene, and mono-substitution with biphenylene (2 -position), pyrene (1 -position), and naphthalene (1 - and 2 -positions); the tris-phenyl and tris-biphenylene derivatives are fluorescent. The 2 -naphthyl substituent freely rotates at 328 K, whereas {{rotation of the}} 1 -naphthyl substituent is prevented by interaction of the peri-hydrogen atom with fluorine. The 1 -naphthyl derivative eliminates a molecule of HF during El mass spectrometry, whilst the 2 -naphthyl derivative eliminates HF and all fluorenes to give a naphthaleno[60]fullerene. The reaction rate is relatively unaffected by electron supply in the aryl rings, but no product was obtained with benzotrifluoride which defines the lower reactivity limit. The low discrimination between aromatics {{makes it possible to}} isolate derivatives having different aryl groups attached to the cage. Reactions occur mainly when the reagent solutions (or solutions in 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene) are evaporated to dryness. In most FeCl 3 -catalysed reactions, unreacted C 60 F 18 was recovered, more if the less effective SnCl, was used as a catalyst; use of AlCl 3 resulted in polyarylation and degradation of the C 60 F 18. The structure of C 60 F 17 (1 -biphenylyl) was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Reaction of C 60 F 18 with perylene/FeCl 3 /o-dichlorobenzene gave red <b>fluorescent</b> "tagliatelli"-like <b>threads</b> (up to I cm. long) of self-assembled pi-stacked tetrachloroperylene arising from chlorination by FeCl 3...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} of novel archaea living in close association with bacteria in the cold (approximately 10 °C) sulfurous marsh water of the Sippenauer Moor near Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany. These microorganisms form a characteristic, macroscopically visible structure, morphologically comparable to a string of pearls. Tiny, whitish globules (the pearls; diameter, about 0. 5 to 3. 0 mm) are connected to each other by thin, white-colored <b>threads.</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have revealed that the outer part of the pearls is mainly composed of bacteria, with a filamentous bacterium predominating. Internally, archaeal cocci are the predominant microorganisms, with up to 107 cells estimated {{to be present in}} a single pearl. The archaea appear to be embedded in a polymer of unknown chemical composition. According to FISH and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the archaea are affiliated with the euryarchaeal kingdom. The new euryarchaeal sequence represents a deep phylogenetic branch within the 16 S rRNA tree and does not show extensive similarity to any cultivated archaea or to 16 S rRNA gene sequences from environmental samples...|$|R
