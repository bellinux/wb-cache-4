5000|$|However, {{critics of}} the {{exhumation}} - most notably Betty Dorsett Duke (1947-2015) - claim that the DNA samples obtained and tested by Starrs' exhumation team did not originate from the remains exhumed from the gravesite.

Consequently, the {{critics of the}} exhumation believe that the primary conclusion <b>the</b> <b>Starrs</b> team published in their report (quoted above) cannot be relied on with any degree of confidence. Going even further, in view of all the evidence which has emerged (since the time of the exhumation) which contradicts the basic conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Starrs</b> exhumation team, many critics of the exhumation now believe that the primary conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Starrs</b> exhumation team (as quoted above) is simply false.|$|R

50|$|The Elizas {{monopoly}} on the main route was broken in 1869, when first she {{was taken off the}} main route. Her owners led by Captain Finch, replaced her with the newer Olympia. To make matters worse, the mail contract which had sustained Eliza was awarded to a firm of upstart competitors, led first by Captain Nash, and then by his financiers <b>the</b> <b>Starrs,</b> who had found the cash to buy the Varuna and build the sidewheeler Alida and the propeller Tacoma in the water. A fare war broke out, and on June 23, 1871, <b>the</b> <b>Starrs</b> brought into Puget Sound the then-new sidewheeler North Pacific to run against the Olympia. When North Pacific proved faster than Eliza, the fare war was ended with the customary anticompetitive agreement, whereby <b>the</b> <b>Starrs</b> would pay Finch for keeping the Eliza and Olympia at the dock. Captain Geo. E. Starr died in 1876, but his company survived him, and built in 1879 the sidewheeler George E. Starr named in his honor.|$|R
500|$|During live performances, the Beatles {{continued}} <b>the</b> <b>Starr</b> Time {{routine that}} had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in A Hard Day's Night, Starr garnered much praise from critics, who considered both his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights of the movie. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night, Starr commented: [...] "Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line." [...] Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to [...] "the little man's quaintness". After {{the release of the}} Beatles' second feature film, Help!

500|$|M. nigriceps is an {{extremely}} aggressive ant, and larger colonies may rival other colonies of a different Myrmecia species (such as M. gulosa) in terms of fierceness and pugnacity. While the mandibles cause little to no pain in humans, the ant {{is equipped with a}} painful and powerful sting that is found {{at the end of the}} gaster. Like other ants, the sting is not barbed, and workers are able to sting multiple times without injuring themselves. With a median lethal dose (LD50) of 7.3mg/kg, the venom is relatively weak in comparison to other Myrmecia ants, whose LD50 is much lower. However, in a 2011 study, at least one patient had an allergic reaction to M. nigriceps venom. This study also concluded that many other Myrmecia species can cause anaphylaxis, as well as the Green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica). In <b>the</b> <b>Starr</b> sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran stings on a four-point scale, the sting of M. nigriceps was ranked as two in pain, described as [...] "painful". M. nigriceps ants are able to enter colonies they do not reside in without being attacked; this may be due to these ants failing to recognise foreigners, or the consequences of ignoring workers from other colonies is low.|$|E

Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of [...] "Love Me Do" [...] featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of [...] "Love Me Do", [...] "Please Please Me" [...] and [...] "P.S.
