40|$|The {{study of}} defects in {{carbon-based}} materials {{is of great}} interest, because of their elusive nature and because these defects determine some of their fundamental electronic, optical and magnetic properties. The type of defects depends strongly on the materials structure. In ordered materials, for example, defects are due to distortions of the crystalline structure, while in amorphous materials they are related most to unsaturated bonds. In recent years, great interest has grown on graphene and graphene-like systems. The properties of these materials make them very promising for electronic and mechanical applications. Deviations from perfection can also be useful in some <b>tecnical</b> applications, as they enable to tailor the local properties of graphene and to achieve new functionalities. Most of the defects {{that can be found}} in carbon-based materials are characterized by the presence of unpaired electrons and are therefore paramagnetic. In several cases, the existence of unpaired spins within a material can lead also to cooperative magnetism phenomena. A complete and accurate description of the defects distribution in a material is therefore of fundamental importance for its possible applications. In this thesis, we identify and characterize the different types of defects that can be found in graphene-like systems by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. We study materials with different types of defects and try to correlate their EPR characteristics with their structure. We also report a study on the reactivity of these materials that is determined by the presence of defects...|$|E

40|$|This text {{is aimed}} to {{describe}} the relationship between materials and design. It refers to a period which starts {{with the birth of}} the first synthetic materials, during the Industrial Revolution, and arrives to the final establishment of synthetic plastics. Industry itself, and the scientific revolution which generated it between the 18 th and the 19 th centuries,had developed thanks to new materials which had made possible series manufacturing methods, replacing the ancient craft ones. The materials that,more than others, got an important symbolic role in that period, were the metals such as steel and cast iron. The use of cast iron and of various metal alloys brought to a new kind of manufacturing which, discomposing complex aggregations into small chunks, was able to combine the big dimension of industrial architecture with the small one of series product. The process of renovation in the use of metals in the home furnishings, started with the Industrial Revolution came to an end with the Bauhaus. But the Industrial Revolution involved even the more traditional materials in the changing process such as the ceramics. The symbol of the transformations in this field is Josiah Wedgwood. He is the best representative of the symbolic figure typical of the period, the inventor-entrepreneur,the one who was able to exploit his <b>tecnical</b> scientific discoveries from an industrial point of view.

The result of Research are : (1) strengths factor : that is a agrotourism wide development area, to development of the agriculture and breeding product centralize, society support, famous place by people, to be formed of tourism and to increase of people deceit, (2) weaknesses factor : that is the place is for from city, to diminish of transport to tourism area, too diminish of tourism promotion, too diminish of hotel in tourism area, human resources confined who know about tourism and the weak of agrotourism support activity, (3) opportunities factor : these are supported by agroclimat, local income, support from local goverment, to enlarge of people, society need for tourism area and to increase of local people deceit (4) threats factor : these are tourism competition with other district, tun quantity of invesment, too deminist of its people unknowledge for they area, too deminist of investor interst, a compete situation from other recreation place, and situation and condition of the economies that uncondusively, (5) alternatif strategy of agrotourism area development in Tutur village, Pasuruan district among other things : to increase people to participate for developing are by espionage, goverment support in speeding up of invesment process, to increase of local tourism promote...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy sources for distributed power generation is the most considered alternative {{to the use of}} fossil fuels in centralized power plants. However, due to their discontinuous operation, the availability of suitable energy storage systems is required. In this field, hydrogen storage technologies {{are one of the most}} interesting options. Hydrogen production, storage and utilization technologies have a high innovation content even if several <b>tecnical</b> and economical problems remain to be solved. In this framework, Sardegna Ricerche has promoted the realization of the “Concentrating Solar and Hydrogen from Renewable Energy Sources” Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Cagliari. Main mission of the laboratory is implementation, testing and demonstration of the technologies related to the production, storage and use of hydrogen from renewable energy sources. For this reason, the main research activities are in the field of the electrochemical characterization of fuel cell stacks and their materials with the aim to improve performance in terms of durability and efficiency, as well as the development of hydrogen storage systems. In particular, the laboratory includes a stand-alone micro-grid powered exclusively by a photovoltaic array and a wind turbine. The microgrid is also coupled with two different energy storage systems: a battery bank and a hydrogen storage system. In particular, the latter is based on two PEM electrolyzers (1 Nm 3 /h each), four hydrogen storage tanks (1 m 3 each) and a PEMFC fuel cell (5 kW). The main aim of this paper is to carry out a detailed analysis of the expected micro-grid performance. In particular, the focus was laid on the implementation of a novel energy management system (EMS). The proposed EMS defines the optimal generation scheduling of the two storage devices in order to minimize operating costs and maximize the efficiency of the system. The results of a comparative study with more conventional EMS demonstrate that the proposed EMS leads to a decrease of almost 5 - 10...|$|E
