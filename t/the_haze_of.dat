PAVN gunners set up a DK-82 recoilless rifle on {{the eastern end of}} Skyline Ridge and took Vang Pao's house and the 20 Alternate airstrip under fire. Intermixed Communist and Royalist troops fought bitterly, hand to hand. Communist artillery fire rained in on the battlefield; tanks set aflame continued to fire.

500|$|On November 12, in {{response}} to rumors that the French had sent out a raiding force, Forbes sent out a detachment of the Virginia regiment to investigate reports of a French raiding expedition. When sounds of gunfire reached the British camp, Forbes sent a second detachment. Primary sources are unclear on which detachment Washington led; the other was led by Lieutenant Colonel George Mercer. In the dimming light of early evening and <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> musket smoke the two detachments mistook {{each other for the}} enemy; the friendly fire incident resulted in 40 casualties. Washington claimed to have interceded, [...] "knocking up with his sword the presented pieces", but Captain Thomas Bullitt, the only other officer to leave an account, held Washington responsible for the incident, noting that his opinion was shared by [...] "several of the officers." [...] The incident appeared to leave an emotional scar on Washington, who did not speak or write of it for many years.|$|E
500|$|The Austrians were {{astonished}} at the Prussian appearance on their left flank. The objective was soon clear: the Prussian infantry, now arrayed {{in the conventional}} two lines of battle, advanced on the weakest part of the Austrian line, intending to roll up the flank. [...] The Austrian colonels on the scene did the best they could: by turning their own lines 90 degrees, they tried {{to take advantage of}} a shallow ditch facing the Prussian line. Franz Leopold von Nádasdy, commanding the flank, asked Charles for support, a request the Prince ignored: even at late morning, with most of the Prussian army on his left flank, he still believed that any attack would come at the northern flank. [...] Most of the men in the first Austrian line were Württembergers, Protestant troops whose willingness to fight the Lutheran Prussians had been called into question by the Austrian command. The Württembergers held out, maintaining steady musket fire until the mass of Prussians emerged through <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder. Then they ran for their lives, sweeping the Bavarians Nádasdy had deployed to support his flank with them.|$|E

500|$|Although he did {{not have}} to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was {{successful}} against English fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one occasion, O'Reilly held his head in his hands when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: [...] "Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!" [...] In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying [...] "You just check how many times I got him out!" [...] The cricket historian David Frith points out that [...] "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." [...] Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: [...] "His element was foul weather. He would disappear into <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> <b>of</b> Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence." ...|$|E

Although Streisand's liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasizes the period setting as just so much dressing, Redford's Fitzgerald-type character [...] [...] [...] is an intriguing trailer for his later Great Gatsby.
