Affective functioning of intellectual property protection system is impossible without creation of an effective system of protection of intellectual property rights in the country, and with no protection for these rights at the international level through the relevant international agreements. Therefore, the article focuses on the legal regulation of relations in the field of intellectual property. Nowadays any state can receive technical assistance of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) (nature of such assistance, the mechanisms of its implementation and evaluation processes of technical assistance should be specified for each country), and because of this reason Ukraine should also encourage the development of the sector of protection of intellectual property, including specific objects of intellectual property. The article highlights the importance of legal protection of specific objects of intellectual property, in particular, analyzes the nature and feature of "integrated circuit" as a specific object of intellectual property. Also the article deals with the procedure of granting rights to the integrated circuit, and also some challenges and unresolved issues of protection and enforcement of the object, points to some norms of national law which need to be improved, taking into account relevant international standards such as Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). International cooperation in almost all fields of human knowledge is impossible without clear rules of regulating the creation, use, and protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including the <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> ? ???? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???? ?? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????, ??????? ???????? ????? ?? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ???? ?? ???????????????? ????????????? ? ??????, ? ??? ???????? ?????? ???? ???? ?? ????????????? ?????? ????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????????. ??????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ????????? ? ????? ???????????????? ?????????????, ? ????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ? ????? ???????????????? ?????????????...|$|E

The resulting amendments and introduction of new rights were carried out mainly to ensure that Malaysia is in compliance with her obligations under the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS Agreement). 1 Among the new laws promulgated were the Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 1994, Industrial Designs Act 1996, Copyright (Amendment) Act 1997, Copyright (Amendment) Act 2000, Patents (Amendment) Act 2000, Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 2000, Geographical Indications Act 2000, the Optical Discs Act 2000 and the Layout Designs (<b>Topographies)</b> <b>of</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Circuits</b> Act 2000.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} (IP), broadly defined, is {{a series}} of privileges accorded to inventors and creators. These privileges are recognized through a series of international agreements that establish minimum standards. The most significant of these agreements is probably the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that binds WTO Member States to comply with a range of existing international IP agreements, and then imposes minimum standards for copyright and related rights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, patents, layout designs (<b>topographies)</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits,</b> and undisclosed information (TRIPS Articles 9 - 39). These IP privileges are generally recognized and enforced through national laws that are consistent with these international norms. The result is a patchwork of national laws, each attempting to articulate at least the minimum standards (albeit many are more generous-the so-called "TRIPS-plus") in the context of national and regional choices. The TRIPS standards adopted and applied by WTO Member States are then subject to WTO dispute resolution and penalties that include retaliatory trade sanctions where states have not implemented and applied their obligations to maintain TRIPS' minimum IP standards (TRIPS Article 64). The WTO dispute resolution and sanction mechanism makes TRIPS one the few enforceable international laws, and hence its gravity in assessing the impacts of IP.

40|$|Manganese {{films have}} been {{identified}} as potential candidates for the self-formation of barriers to prevent the diffusion of copper interconnects into the underlying silicon substrate. Given the complex <b>topography</b> <b>of</b> the modern <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> where these diffusion barriers are to be used and the unique nature of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), those methods are considered to replace the traditional physical deposition approach, forming more conformal diffusion barriers layers. In this project, the growth of manganese-based films on silicon substrates via chemical deposition of two Mn metalorganic complexes, bis(N,N '-di-isopropyl-pentylamidinato) Mn(II)) (Mn Amidinate) and methylcyclopentadienyl-manganese(I) tricarbonyl (MeCpMn(CO) 3, was characterized and contrasted by using an instrument equipped with a reactor coupled to a X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analytical chamber. The goal of this project is to develop a molecular-level understanding of the surface chemistry for the precursor to improve the selection of manganese precursors. In our initial studies on the nature of films prepared by chemical means using MeCpMn(CO) 3 as the precursor, it was found that a manganese silicate layer grows first and a thin manganese silicide film develops latter at the SiO 2 /Si (100) interface between approximately 550 and 750 K. It was also found that a typical nude ion gauge is capable of enhancing the deposition through gas-phase activation of MeCpMn(CO) 3 by electron bombardment. Finally, Mn Amidinate was proved to be highly reactive, affording the deposition of Mn at reasonable rates, higher at higher temperatures, but also leading to the incorporation of nitrogen and additional carbon in the grown Mn(0) films; MeCpMn(CO) 3, by contrast, was quite unreactive, but did not leave nitrogen contaminants on the surface. As with the carbonyl precursor, deposition with the Mn amidinate leads to the formation of a nonstoichiometric mixture of MnOx + SiOx and Mn silicate first, possibly followed by the formation of a thin subsurface Mn silicide layer. The combined Mn silicate/Mn silicide structure acts as an effective diffusion barrier, after which Mn(0) metallic films can be grown on top. One copper precursor, copper (I) - N,N '-di- sec -butylacetamidinate, was also deposited on the as-formed manganese thin film above with different ratios of Mn(0) and Mn silicate.
