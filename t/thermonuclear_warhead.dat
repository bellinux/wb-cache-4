500|$|An Operational Requirement (OR1142) {{had been}} issued in 1955 for a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> for a medium-range {{ballistic}} missile, which became Blue Streak. This was revised in November 1955, with [...] "megaton" [...] replacing [...] "thermonuclear". Orange Herald (small) could then meet the requirement. A version was created as an interim megaton weapon {{in order to}} provide the RAF with one at the earliest possible date. Codenamed Green Grass, the unsuccessful fusion boosting was omitted, and it used Green Bamboo's 72 lens implosion system instead of Orange Herald's 32. This allowed the amount of highly enriched uranium to be reduced from [...] to [...] Its yield was estimated at [...] It was placed in a Blue Danube casing, and this bomb became known as Violet Club. About ten were delivered before Yellow Sun became available.|$|E
2500|$|Sky Scorcher was a {{very large}} missile, which was {{projected}} {{to be capable of}} carrying a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> with a yield of two megatons. The oversized warhead would be used against attacking formations of supersonic bombers; it was anticipated that fourteen such initiations, at a distance of approximately [...] from the bombers' target, would be sufficient to disrupt an attack. A force of eighty of the advanced fighters were proposed for carrying the weapon.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{consignment}} of R-12 missiles {{arrived on}} the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was a medium-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead.</b> It was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable liquid propellant fueled missile that could deliver a megaton-class nuclear weapon. The Soviets were building nine sites â€” six for R-12 medium-range missiles (NATO designation SS-4 Sandal) with an effective range of [...] and three for R-14 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation SS-5 Skean) with a maximum range of [...]|$|E

25|$|Other tests {{occurred}} elsewhere {{throughout the}} islands, with an official testing range covering {{over half of}} the landmass. In September 1961, two propelled <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> were launched from Vorkuta Sovetsky and Salekhard to target areas on Novaya Zemlya. The launch rocket was subsequently deployed to Cuba.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> {{carried by}} the Hound Dog was the W28 Class D. The W28 warhead could be preset to yield an {{explosive}} power of between 70 kilotons and 1.45 megatons. Detonation of the Hound Dog's W28 warhead could be programmed to occur on impact (ground burst) or air burst at a preset altitude. An air burst would have been used against a large area, soft target. A [...] surface impact would have been used against a hard target such as a missile site or command and control center.|$|E
2500|$|The W88 is a United States <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead,</b> with an {{estimated}} yield of 475 kilotons (kt), and is {{small enough to fit}} on MIRVed missiles. [...] The W88 was designed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1970s. In 1999, the director of Los Alamos who had presided over its design described it as [...] "the most advanced U.S. nuclear warhead." [...] As of 2014, the latest version is called the W88 ALT 370 and the first production unit is scheduled for December 2019. The Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) can be armed with up to 12 W88 warheads (Mark 5 re-entry vehicle) or 12 100 kt W76 warheads (Mark 4 re-entry vehicle), but it is limited to eight warheads under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty.|$|E
2500|$|Von Braun was {{put into}} the rocket design {{division}} of the Army due to his prior direct involvement {{in the creation of}} the V-2 rocket. Between 1945 and 1958, his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind the V-2 to the American engineers. Despite Von Braun's many articles on the future of space rocketry, the US Government continued funding Air Force and Navy rocket programs to test their Vanguard missiles in spite of numerous costly failures. It was not until the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik 1 atop an R-7 ICBM capable of carrying a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warhead</b> to the US, that the Army and the government started taking serious steps towards putting Americans in space. Finally, they turned to von Braun and his team, who during these years created and experimented with the Jupiter series of rockets. The Juno I was the rocket that launched the first American satellite in January 1958, and part of the last-ditch plan for NACA (the predecessor of NASA) to get its foot in the Space Race. The Jupiter series was one more step in von Braun's journey to the Saturn V, later calling that first series [...] "an infant Saturn".|$|E
5000|$|... "Polaris" [...] {{itself was}} an {{operational}} system of four Resolution-class submarines, each armed with 16 UGM-27 Polaris A-3 ballistic missiles, with each missile {{able to deliver}} three ET.317 <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> around a single target. This configuration was later upgraded to carry two hardened warheads along {{with a range of}} decoys.|$|R
2500|$|All {{so-called}} [...] "fission-fusion-fission" [...] weapons (i.e., all conventional modern <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads)</b> {{employ the}} additional step of [...] "jacket fissioning," [...] using fusion neutrons. This works as follows: the high-energy or [...] "fast" [...] neutrons generated by fusion {{are used to}} fission a fissionable jacket located around the fusion stage. In the past this jacket was often made of natural or depleted uranium; but today's weapons {{in which there is}} a premium on weight and size (i.e., virtually all modern strategic weapons) use moderately-to-highly enriched uranium as the jacketing material (see Oralloy <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> section below). The fast fission of the secondary jacket in fission-fusion-fission bombs is sometimes referred to as a [...] "third stage" [...] in the bomb, but it should not be confused with the obsolete true three-stage thermonuclear design, in which there existed another complete tertiary fusion stage.|$|R
50|$|The SLAM was {{designed}} to complement the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and as a possible replacement for, or augment to, the Strategic Air Command system. In the event of nuclear war {{it was intended to}} fly below the cover of enemy radar at supersonic speeds, and deliver <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads</b> to roughly 16 targets.|$|R

50|$|Thor was {{the first}} {{operational}} ballistic missile deployed by the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Named after the Norse god of thunder, it was deployed in the United Kingdom between 1959 and September 1963 as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads.</b> Thor was 65 ft in height and 8 ft in diameter. It was later augmented in the U.S. IRBM arsenal by the Jupiter.|$|R

50|$|An {{intercontinental}} {{ballistic missile}} (ICBM) is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of 5500 km primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery (delivering one or more <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads).</b> Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs. Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target.|$|R

50|$|A {{multiple}} independently targetable {{reentry vehicle}} (MIRV) is a ballistic missile payload containing several <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>warheads,</b> each {{capable of being}} aimed to hit a different target. By contrast, a unitary warhead is a single warhead on a single missile. An intermediate case is the multiple reentry vehicle (MRV) missile which carries several warheads which are dispersed but not individually aimed.
