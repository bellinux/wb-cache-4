5|$|After <b>this</b> <b>failure,</b> Pyrrhus ravaged the Spartan {{hinterland}} whilst {{fending off}} counter-attacks by the victorious Spartans. On {{the invitation of}} an Argive ally, Pyrrhus attempted to seize Argos. The assault culminated in a fiasco with Pyrrhus being attacked by his Argive opponents, the pursuing Spartan army of Areus and a Macedonian army commanded by Antigonus Gonatas. Pyrrhus {{was killed in the}} ensuing battle in the streets of Argos, ending Epiriote hopes of establishing a hegemony in Greece.|$|E

He followed his father into the study of medicine, but failed his entrance exam to Trinity College of Medicine in 1846.

5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite <b>this</b> <b>failure</b> as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1815 Austen {{moved her}} work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who {{published}} Emma in December 1815 {{and a second}} edition of Mansfield Park in February 1816.

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare.

40|$|Under {{in-plane}} loading conditions, two independent modes {{contribute to the}} failure of a spot weld: the in-plane shear mode and the in-plane rotational mode. In <b>this</b> work, the <b>failures</b> of both modes under large static load are examined individually. To study the combined failure of these two modes, two special test coupons are designed. The first coupon contains one spot weld. The second coupon contains five spot welds. Tests conducted in this work show that a very simple force-based failure criterion can be used to predict the failure of a spot weld under large in-plane combined static loads. Current multiaxial failure theory cannot explain <b>this</b> combined <b>failure.</b> <b>This</b> force-based spot weld failure criterion fits current automotive industry needs for body shell finite element application very well...|$|R

5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and <b>this</b> <b>failure</b> to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored {{by the fact that}} he was the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. <b>This</b> <b>failure,</b> and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, but it was too late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E

5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of commissions despite <b>this</b> <b>failure.</b> Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after East Coast landscape architects. Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a steady stream of commissions.|$|E

Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima (Story of Njai Dasima). He then directed and produced Huwen op Bevel (Forced to Marry; 1931), which was advertised as featuring songs and comedy. The film was a commercial failure, leading to all rights being acquired by Tan's. He is recorded as planning a further two films, De Nona (Of Ladies) and Raonah, but neither was made.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of <b>this</b> <b>failure,</b> the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task that would take too long to complete.|$|E
