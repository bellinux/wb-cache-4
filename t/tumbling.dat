40|$|<b>Tumble</b> dryers {{and drying}} {{cabinets}} have {{to a large}} extent replaced the traditional way of drying clothes outdoors. They are faster, more convenient, require less space and can be operated regardless of weather conditions. This replacement has significantly increased residential energy consumption, {{due to the fact that}} <b>tumbles</b> dryers consume large amounts of electrical energy. In the USA 9 % of the households electric energy is consumed when drying clothes. Over 4 million <b>tumble</b> dryers are sold in Europe each year and 20 % of the residential electricity consumption in Sweden is used drying and washing clothes. <b>Tumble</b> dryers are also utilized in the industrial sector, but industrial dryers are not considered in this study. Increasing energy costs contributes to the public’s awareness and desire to cut their energy consumption. The aim of this study is to increase the energy efficiency and drastically reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> dryers. There are two main types of <b>tumble</b> dryers available on the market; the open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer and the closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. The open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer is often attached to the ventilation system and thereby it evacuates its exhaust air. The closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer condenses the water from the air before it recirculates it. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce electric power use of <b>tumble</b> dryers, two separate studies were made. One on a water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer and one on a hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. Both <b>tumble</b> dryers where rebuild and originated from the same <b>tumble</b> dryer. The <b>tumble</b> dryer that both studies originated from was a conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. The <b>tumble</b> dryer is made by Asko Cylinda AB. The results reveal that the water cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer does not have greater energy efficiency than the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. However the drying time was reduced by 37 %. The result also reveals that the hot water heated open cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer cuts the electric consumption by 93 % and improves the energy efficiency by 53 % compared to the conventional air cooled closed cycle <b>tumble</b> dryer. On the other hand the drying time increases by 9 %...|$|R

40|$|By {{using the}} children's own {{thoughts}} and stories this theses aim {{to investigate and}} illustrate the phenomenon of rough and <b>tumble</b> play and its existence among five year olds in preschool.      The formulations of the questions are: What do children consider as rough and <b>tumble</b> play? - and what characterise that? From without a perspective of rough and <b>tumble</b> play, which kinds of rough and <b>tumble</b> play do the children play in preschool? - and how do those characterise? What makes rough and <b>tumble</b> play possible and accepted {{for the children to}} play in preschool? In this thesis I have investigated the questions above by interviewing 11 five years olds about how they consider rough and <b>tumble</b> play in preschool. From without Birgitta Knutsdotter Olofsson's and Torben Hangaard Rasmussen's view about play and rough and <b>tumble</b> play I created a perspective of rough and <b>tumble</b> play, which I used for analyzing the empirics. With rough and <b>tumble</b> play I mean games or plays that includes wrestling, hitting, kicking, pushing, chasing, running or/and the use of weapons against other human beings or other visualized beings or/and human beings. The conclusions are that children has many different opinions of what rough and <b>tumble</b> play is. Depends on who you are asking you will get a different perspective. The conclusions also shows that rough and <b>tumble</b> play can exist, not just by its self, but also in interplay with other kinds of games and plays. The children are using different strategies to make the rough and <b>tumble</b> play fit the restrictions put on by the educators in the preschool. ...|$|R

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and white-tailed kites. The nests may be raided by {{a range of}} species {{including}} mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation {{has not yet been}} directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the <b>tumbling</b> off the bush. Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator. The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the <b>tumbling</b> off the bush display.|$|E

40|$|Due to its {{positive}} effect on flame propagation {{in the case of}} a well-defined breakdown, the formation of a large-scale <b>tumble</b> motion is an important goal in engine development. Cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV) in the <b>tumble</b> position and strength however lead to a fluctuating <b>tumble</b> breakdown in space and time and therefore to combustion variations, indicated by CCV of the peak pressure. This work aims at a detailed investigation of the large-scale <b>tumble</b> motion and its interaction with the piston boundary layer during the intake stroke in a state-of-the-art gasoline engine. To allow the validation of the flow near the piston surface obtained by simulation, a new measurement technique called “Flying PIV” is applied.

The large-scale <b>tumble</b> motion is investigated based on numerical data of multiple highly resolved intake strokes obtained using scale-resolving simulations. A method to detect the <b>tumble</b> center position within a 3 D flow field, as an extension of previously developed 2 D and 3 D algorithms, is presented and applied. It is then used to investigate the phase-averaged <b>tumble</b> structure, its characteristics in terms of angular velocity and the CCV between the individual intake strokes.

5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid <b>tumbling</b> in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law.

5|$|Mirror's Edge {{is set in}} a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, {{in which}} a network of 'runners', {{including}} the main character, Faith Connors, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, <b>tumbling,</b> wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} investigations of the in-cylinder <b>tumble</b> flows in an unfired internal combustion engine with a flat piston at the engine speeds ranging from 400 to 1000 rev/min., and also with the dome and dome-cavity pistons at an engine speed of 1000 rev/min., using particle image velocimetry. From the two-dimensional in-cylinder flow measurements, <b>tumble</b> flow analysis is {{carried out in the}} combustion space on a vertical plane passing through cylinder axis. To analyze the <b>tumble</b> flows, ensemble average velocity vectors are used and to characterize it, <b>tumble</b> ratio is estimated. From the results, generally, we have found that <b>tumble</b> ratio varies mainly with crank angle position. Also, at the end of compression stroke, average turbulent kinetic energy is more at higher engine speeds. We have also found that, at 330 crank angle position, flat piston shows an improvement of about 85 and 23 % in <b>tumble</b> ratio, and about 24 and 2. 5 % in average turbulent kinetic energy compared to dome and dome-cavity pistons respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{automobiles}} {{of today}} {{are getting more}} fuel efficient {{in order to meet}} future emission standards. It is also important to have more fuel efficient engines than the competitors. The consequence is that engine development is intensified and more ideas needs to be tested thoroughly. One of the ideas at Volvo cars is a <b>tumble</b> flap. The <b>tumble</b> flap is controlled to close a predefined part of the intake port in order to increase the <b>tumble</b> motion in the combustion chamber. A <b>tumble</b> motion is a circular motion with it's axis of rotation parallel to the engine head. To make the effects of the <b>tumble</b> flap clearly visible an optical engine is used. An optical engine has a cylinder and piston made of glass which makes it possible to record what happens in the combustion chamber while the engine is running. The fuel is injected directly to the combustion chamber, so called direct injection engine. This gives excellent opportunity to see how the spray is affected by an increased <b>tumble</b> motion. The effect on the combustion could be seen when changing parameters. The events appear in {{a fraction of a second}} why a high speed camera is used to capture the events. It has been shown that the spray is mostly effected in a late phase of the intake stroke. The spray is stable and relatively small in the early stage and is therefore only mildly effected by the ongoing gas motion. With the <b>tumble</b> flap activated, it is possible to observe that fuel is moving back to the valves before it is evaporated. Sometimes it is possible to see a <b>tumble</b> motion within the spray. If the injection pressure is increased, the initial spray stability will increase, the fuel reaches further before it is effected of the ongoing gas motion. The combustion takes place considerably faster with the <b>tumble</b> flap restriction. A problem with the <b>tumble</b> flap is that diffusion flame combustion may occur due to an increased risk of wall wetting...|$|R
