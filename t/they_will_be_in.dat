Otherwise, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> units of degrees Celsius.

However, Black knows she is {{doing the right thing}} and is {{determined}} to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing. Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the family's holiday cabin in the woods.

25|$|The {{greatest}} life threat due to GHB overdose (with {{or without}} other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common {{causes of death}} due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while {{driving under the influence}} of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving, who must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a good mood but this does not mean they are not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.|$|E

Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness. However, even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together. A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> big trouble if the Prince finds out. Back on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction. When he arrives, Mercutio mocks him as well. Romeo rushes to aid his friend, but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening, and everyone thinks that he is dead. The Prince, jealous of Juliet's affection for Romeo, exiles Romeo to Shark Island. In despair, Juliet seeks the Friar's help, and he gives her a potion {{to put her in}} a deathlike state. Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing, remarking, [...] "What a tangled web we weave." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad {{announced}} in 1901 {{that they had}} agreed {{to build a new}} union station together, the city had two reasons to celebrate. The decision meant that both railroads would soon remove their trackwork and terminals from the National Mall. Though changes there appeared only gradually, the consolidation of the depots allowed the creation of the Mall as it appears today. Secondly, the plan to bring all the city's railroads under one roof promised that Washington would finally have a station both large enough to handle large crowds and impressive enough to befit the city's role as the federal capital. The station was to be designed under the guidance of Daniel Burnham, a famed Chicago architect and member of the U.S. Senate Park Commission, who in September 1901 wrote to the Commission's chairman, Sen. James McMillan, of the proposed project: [...] "The station and its surroundings should be treated in a monumental manner, as they will become the vestibule of the city of Washington, and as <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> close proximity to the Capitol itself." ...|$|E

But for some reason this particular decision struck me as so blindingly stupid, so profoundly un-American." [...] He added, [...] "Bravery will come from our churches, our synagogues, everyday folks.

On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E
2500|$|Irenaeus, {{the late}} 2nd century bishop of Lyon was an outspoken premillennialist. He {{is best known}} for his voluminous tome written against the 2nd century Gnostic threat, {{commonly}} called Against Heresies. In the fifth book of Against Heresies, Irenaeus concentrates primarily on eschatology. In one passage he defends premillennialism by arguing that a future earthly kingdom is necessary because of God's promise to Abraham, he wrote “The promise remains steadfast... God promised him the inheritance of the land. Yet, Abraham did not receive it during all the time of his journey there. Accordingly, it must be that Abraham, together with his seed (that is, those who fear God and believe in Him), will receive it at the resurrection of the just.” In another place Irenaeus also explained that the blessing to Jacob “belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom when the righteous will bear rule, after their rising from the dead. It is also the time when the creation will bear fruit with an abundance of all kinds of food, having been renovated and set free... And all of the animals will feed on the vegetation of the earth... and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> perfect submission to man. And these things are borne witness to in the fourth book of the writings of Papias, the hearer of John, and a companion of Polycarp.” (5.33.3) Apparently Irenaeus also held to the sexta-/septamillennial scheme writing that the end of human history will occur after the 6,000th year.
