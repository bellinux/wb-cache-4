5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival {{there is}} no record of further {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the music manuscript in the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>discovery</b> of this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing of <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of}} the hyena den. His work led to <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented the eggs {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of the eggs and the largely overlapping distribution.

With <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, the eggs of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
