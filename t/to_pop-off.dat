40|$|Habitat use, {{movement}} and residency of bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas were determined using satellite pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags throughout coastal {{areas in the}} U. S., Gulf of Mexico and waters off the south-east U. S. From 2005 to 2007, 18 ﬁsh (mean size = 164 cm fork length, LF) were tagged over all seasons. Fish retained tags for up to 85 days (median = 30 days). Based on geolocation data from initial tagging location <b>to</b> <b>pop-off</b> location, C. leucas generally travelled c. 5 – 6 km day− 1 and travelled an average of 143 · 6 km. Overall, mean proportions of time at depth revealed C. leucas spent {{the majority of their}} time in waters < 20 m. They exhibited signiﬁcant differences among depths but were not found at a particular depth regardless of diurnal period. Most ﬁsh occupied temperatures c. 32 ◦C with individuals found mostly between 26 and 33 ◦C. Geolocation data for C. leucas were generally poor and varied considerably but tracks for two individuals revealed long distance movements. One ﬁsh travelled from the south-east coast of the U. S. to coastal Texas near Galveston while another moved up the east coast of the U. S. to South Carolina. Data on C. leucas movements indicated that they are found primarily in shallower waters and tend to remain in the same location over long periods. While some individuals made large-scale movements over open ocean areas, the results emphasize the importance of the coastal zone for this species as potential essential habitat, particularly in areas of high freshwater inﬂow...|$|E
50|$|Tony Stewart set {{a rookie}} record by leading the first 31 laps. His day ended on lap 82, however, {{when he lost}} an engine, due <b>to</b> a bad <b>pop-off</b> valve. Despite not finishing, he secured the {{rookie of the year}} award.|$|R
50|$|After {{the track}} closed, USAC disqualified Steve Krisiloff and Tom Bigelow {{for the same}} infraction that Dick Ferguson was disqualified for earlier - illegal {{wastegate}} exhaust pipes and attempting <b>to</b> over-ride the <b>pop-off</b> valve. As a result, the bumped cars of John Mahler and John Martin were re-instated to the field.|$|R
5000|$|During time trials, all {{cars were}} {{required}} <b>to</b> carry a <b>pop-off</b> valve <b>to</b> control turbocharger [...] "boost." [...] Maximum boost levels were set at 80 inHG. The reduction of boost, reduction of wing sizes, and other technical changes lowered speeds by about 8-10 mph from 1973. As a result, top speeds would be around 190 mph, and the elusive 200 mph barrier would be out-of-reach for 1974.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{proved a}} return to the year's trend, with the long straights of Hockenheim {{showcasing}} the brute strength of the turbos, with the only atmos car on the lead lap behind both McLarens and Ferraris respectively being Capelli's March. Capelli recorded the fastest 'atmo' speed trap of the season during qualifying, the Judd V8 pushing the March 881 to 312 km/h, though this was significantly slower than the McLarens at 333 km/h, and Ferraris at 328 km/h. Unable to exploit the power of their Megatron turbos thanks <b>to</b> the <b>pop-off</b> valve regularly cutting in at around 2.3 bar instead of the full 2.5 bar limit, the Arrows A10Bs of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever struggled, only trapping at around 315 km/h.|$|R
40|$|Nasal {{foreign body}} in {{children}} {{is not an}} uncommon presentation to the Emergency Department. Removal is essential. Many methods of removal exist. Nasal wash technique is advocated mainly in friable foreign bodies. We report the successful use of the oral bag-valve-mask insufflation technique to remove friable facial tissue in the left nose of a 2 year-old girl. We used a pediatric bag-valve-mask with a pop-off pressure relief valve <b>to</b> avoid barotrauma. <b>Pop-off</b> pressure relief valve limits the pressure beyond 30 mmHg. Conscious sedation was not required. There were no complications...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{show that}} male {{external}} catheters /urisheaths combined with urine bags are preferred over absorbent products - in particular {{when it comes}} to ‘limitations to daily activities’. Advantages also include that they are discreet (it is easier to keep a personal matter that you are incontinent), your skin stays dry all the time (avoid skin irritation), and it is convenient to use both day and night. Potential complications can be increase in severity and frequency with long-term use. Up to 40% of condom catheter users will develop a urinary tract infection with long-term use. Additionally, 15% of long term users will develop skin injuries including: inflammation, ulceration, necrosis, gangrene and constriction of the penis. Additionally, sizing can prove difficult for some men, leading to dislodgement of the catheter and urine spillage during voiding (commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>pop-offs</b> or blow-offs). Additionally, 1.3% of condom catheter users will develop a bladder or renal stone requiring medical treatment.|$|R
50|$|With {{the return}} of the {{naturally}} aspirated engines, and the aforementioned turbo ban in mind, the FIA introduced new rules for 1987 in an effort to reduce costs and slow down the cars with a resultant increase in safety, as well as to increase competitiveness between the two engine types. Turbo-powered cars now had <b>to</b> feature a <b>pop-off</b> valve which restricted boost to 4.0 bar, thus limiting engine power. However, advances in engine development, aerodynamics, tyres and suspension meant that the leading teams such as Williams, McLaren and Ferrari nonetheless frequently recorded faster times than they had in 1986, when turbo boost was unrestricted. The FIA also banned super-soft (and sticky) qualifying tyres for 1987, thus eliminating the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.|$|R
5000|$|The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve was {{notoriously}} {{heavy on}} {{fuel for the}} turbos, so Honda engineers decided <b>to</b> set the <b>pop-off</b> valve at 2.3 Bar for the race to lessen the possibility of running out of fuel. While this gave both McLaren and Lotus approximately [...] less than they could use in qualifying, {{it was expected that}} the power of the Honda would enable McLaren to once again run comfortably in front of their rivals. Despite this, Benetton, the leading naturally-aspirated team, were reasonably confident about the race and the B188s of Nannini and Boutsen allegedly went to the grid with 215 litres of fuel on board, the theory being that when the cars' fuel load lightened, they could continue pushing (depending on their tyre wear) while the turbo cars slowed in order to finish before running dry.|$|R
50|$|While 1987 and 1988 were Arrows' {{best years}} in F1, {{they were also}} the cause of {{frustration}} for the team and its drivers Warwick and Cheever. At the start of 1987 the sports ruling body (FIA) mandated that all turbo powered cars were <b>to</b> use a <b>pop-off</b> valve in order to restrict turbo boost. This was done not only to slow the cars down for safety reasons, {{but it was an}} effort to curb the rapidly rising costs of Formula One. The problem for Arrows was that the valve would regularly cut in lower than the set limit (4.0 bar in 1987, 2.5 bar in 1988). This meant that the Megatron engines were not producing their full power. It took the team's chief mechanic Heini Mader until just before the 1988 Italian Grand Prix at Monza (Round 12) to find the solution which was simply moving the valve closer to the engine, something Honda and Ferrari engineers had long before discovered. Although Cheever and Warwick finished the race in 3rd and 4th respectively, it was too little too late as the turbo era ended after the 1988 season.|$|R
50|$|The {{third row}} of the grid was a surprise, even at this power circuit. Ever since the item was made {{compulsory}} for turbo powered cars {{at the start of}} the 1987 season, the Arrows team had been experiencing problems with the FIA pop-off valve on their Megatron turbo engines, the problem being that the valve was cutting in too early and the drivers weren't able to exploit the full available power. In 1987 this meant that drivers Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever struggled to keep up with their turbocharged rivals. In 1988 it meant they were often only as fast as the leading atmos, and often they were in fact slower, even on noted power circuits such as Silverstone and Hockenheim which should have suited their turbo power. The team's engine guru Heini Mader had finally solved the pop-off valve problem (which turned out <b>to</b> be the <b>pop-off</b> valve being located too high above the engine, a problem Honda and Ferrari had long since solved), and suddenly with an extra 30-50 bhp at their disposal the Arrows A10B's were actually 5 km/h faster than the Honda-powered McLarens across the start line and by the time the reached the speed trap before the Rettifilo, Cheever was reported to be the only car to hit 200 mph while the McLarens and Ferraris were timed at around 192 mph. This new found power allowed Cheever and Warwick to line up 5th and 6th respectively, one place in front of World Champion Nelson Piquet in his Lotus Honda. This also meant that turbos filled the first seven places on the grid. Piquet's Lotus team mate Satoru Nakajima qualified 10th, with the Lotuses split by the fastest non-turbos, the Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Alessandro Nannini in 8th and 9th places on the grid. Due in no small part to their sudden improvement in speed, Arrows were suddenly being seen as a dark horse for the race should McLaren and Ferrari run into problems.|$|R
