5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries {{to cut off the}} locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.|$|E
5|$|Using the equipment, {{they are}} able to {{intercept}} messages in Latin detailing an upcoming exchange at South Station in an hour. They realize the handler removed a small crystalline disk from the Federal agent's hand when he identified her body, and that he is now going to exchange it for something else. Olivia intercepts <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> killed before she can talk to him. She chases another man involved in the exchange, who commits suicide in front of a bus after giving them a briefcase containing the disc. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) secretly gives the disc to Nina for analysis, while Roy is sent home, as they believe he will no longer see visions because the Ghost Network has been compromised.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Ferreira walking towards a blue {{projector}} screen, wearing black sunglasses, a black {{jacket and a}} transparent, fishnet-pattern top. Ferreira stops and removes the jacket slowly {{as a group of}} voyeurs observes her. During her act, she continuously looks towards a man with shades and long hair, who sips a drink while watching Ferreira. Outside the nightclub, she is seen again with that man—her apparent love interest—as they kiss each other and involve themselves physically. They reencounter in a black room where Ferreira sticks an ice pick on his face; in response, he slaps her, to which she smiles and they start kissing again. After they reenter the nightclub, another man kisses her, while her love interest looks surprised. The latter walks away and finds a woman with whom he starts dancing and kissing, much to Ferreira's sadness. The next morning, she wakes up in a grass field with red marks on her face while holding the ice pick, which is now covered in blood. In a different setting, <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> lying on a bed, sees his stomach cut with the word [...] "not", dripping blood as well. Spins Marc Hogan found the video too [...] "focused on Ferreira's model" [...] abilities to [...] "complement the song effectively".|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the show that was widely {{discussed}} among commentators was the moral dilemma presented in the episode between a pragmatic approach to ruling or remaining true to the ideals of justice and honor, exemplified in the scene where Eddard summons Tywin Lannister to the court to answer for the crimes of his bannerman Gregor Clegane. Poniewozik states that Eddard [...] "doesn't seem to consider that he has options: he is left to rule in the king's place, an injustice has been committed, the law requires one path to justice and he chooses it. This makes his decision easy, but it may make his life, and others', difficult." [...] According to The Atlantics Scott Meslow, [...] "Ned's principles are, as always, admirable, and he's clearly interested in justice. But the sad {{truth is that the}} lack of guile that makes him honorable also makes him a pretty poor king. It's a terrible idea to order the arrest of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> single-handedly financing your kingdom." [...] Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, agreed with Meslow and concluded that [...] "the only thing more dangerous than a reckless man asserting their [...] power in Westeros is an honorable man doing the same, as it threatens the delicate framework which has propped up King Robert for so long." ...|$|E
