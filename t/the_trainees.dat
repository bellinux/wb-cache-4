5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4March; all but one of <b>the</b> <b>trainees</b> had prior flying experience, and the course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a Gipsy Moth that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{format of}} assimilators is as follows. An episode is {{described}} (page 1) followed by 4 or 5 explanations of {{why there is}} a problem or difficulty.

The explanations are selected such that when people from culture B are learning about culture A most of the explanations are frequently given by people in culture B and one explanation comes from culture A. After <b>the</b> <b>trainee</b> selects an explanation s/he is asked to turn to a page (pages 2, 3, 4, 5) that gives feedback about each explanation. If the explanation selected by <b>the</b> <b>trainee</b> is incorrect, <b>the</b> <b>trainee</b> is told {{that this is not the}} best explanation, and to try another explanation. When <b>the</b> <b>trainee</b> picks <b>the</b> correct explanation, the feedback is extensive, describing cultural similarities and differences between cultures A and B. Assimilators that use feedback that includes culture theory, such as the differences between collectivist and individualist cultures, are especially effective. Gradually, <b>the</b> <b>trainee</b> from culture B starts thinking like the people from culture A. In a way, s/he learns to get “into the shoes” of the people from the other culture.|$|R
