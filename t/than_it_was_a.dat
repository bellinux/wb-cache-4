25|$|After teaming {{together}} since 1985, The Rockers split up in December 1991 after backstage disputes. The {{exact nature of}} the dispute has not been confirmed by the WWF other <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> monetary issue that lead to Jannetty quitting the WWF on behalf of both Rockers. According to Michaels's book, Jannetty had claimed that World Championship Wrestling were willing {{to give them a}} very high guaranteed contract but when Michaels inquired about it {{it turned out to be}} an exaggeration. Jannetty disputes this saying that Michaels was the driving force suggesting to quit the WWF, but had Jannetty do the phone call to ask for a release from their contract. When Vince McMahon actually agreed to let them go Michaels appeared shocked according to him, and later went to McMahon unbeknownst to him to explain this was Jannetty's idea only and that he had no intention of leaving the WWF himself. After cooler heads prevailed it was decided that The Rockers should split with Michaels turning heel to feud with Jannetty. Jannetty was not happy about the team splitting, while Michaels could not wait to work as a singles wrestler.|$|E

Kilimanjaro, at , is the highest peak on the continent. Since 1912 the glacier cover on the summit of Kilimanjaro has apparently retreated 75%, and the volume of glacial ice is now 80% less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> century ago due to both retreat and thinning. [...] In the 14-year period from 1984 to 1998, {{one section of the}} glacier atop the mountain receded [...] A 2002 study determined that if current conditions continue, the glaciers atop Kilimanjaro will disappear sometime between 2015 and 2020. A March 2005 report indicated that there is almost no remaining glacial ice on the mountain, and {{it is the first time}} in 11,000 years that barren ground has been exposed on portions of the summit. Researchers reported Kilimanjaro's glacier retreat was due to a combination of increased sublimation and decreased snow fall.|$|E

2500|$|... This {{theory was}} {{forwarded}} at the 2008 Rhodesian Ridgeback World Congress, and contends that an honest {{evaluation of the}} breed's functional history indicates that during its formative development and early use as a breed, the ridgeback was much more a [...] "hunter's/farmer's ox-wagon dog" [...] <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lion dog". This theory aligns itself with the current FCI classification of the breed, group 6.3 (a special type of scenthound). However, the important distinction in this theory {{is not that the}} FCI classification of [...] "scenthound" [...] is accurate, but rather, that placing the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian ridgeback (the only breeds currently in FCI group 6.3), breeds that historically have served as versatile hunting/wagon dogs, should indeed be classified as two examples of the same type of dog, but further asserts that such dogs’ classification makes more sense as a discrete group. This classification theory is generally supported by historical accounts that mirror the one offered by Phyllis Archdale who went to Southern Africa in 1919 and bred ridgebacks there in the 1920s, [...] "Old timers told me that in early days most Dutch transport riders had a Ridgehound as guard to their wagons.
