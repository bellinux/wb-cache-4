5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> at the same time.|$|E
500|$|... was a Saturday night {{prime time}} variety show that aired on Rai Uno from September 1968 to January 1969. It was hosted by Mina, Walter Chiari and Paolo Panelli. The orchestrations were scored by the {{conductors}} Bruno Canfora and Augusto Martelli. [...] "Sacumdì Sacumdà", Mina's <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> version of Carlos Imperial's bossa nova [...] "Nem Vem Que Não Tem", narrowly escaped a ban by RAI {{because of its}} irreverent lyrics. The song was performed {{as part of a}} musical fantasy, back to back with [...] "Quelli che hanno un cuore", her intense version of [...] "Anyone Who Had a Heart". Another interpretation of a Dionne Warwick song was [...] "La voce del silenzio" [...] ("Silent Voices") by Paolo Limiti and Elio Isola, presented in a live session during the show. [...] "Niente di niente" [...] ("Nothing at All") was her version of the Delfonics' [...] "Break Your Promise". The series also included the songs [...] "Fantasia", [...] "La musica è finita" [...] ("The Music is Over") and the elegant [...] "Un colpo al cuore" [...] ("Heart Attack"). [...] "Un colpo al cuore" [...] ended up as #68 on the best-selling singles chart for that year in Italy. Each show was closed by Mina singing [...] "Vorrei che fosse amore" [...] ("Wish It Was Love"), a piece of atmospheric music by Bruno Canfora that was #50 on the best-selling singles chart for 1968 in Italy. A selection of songs from the series were issued as the album Canzonissima '68.|$|E
60|$|They found Birkin and Ursula sitting {{together}} by the boats, <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing.</b> Birkin had been teasing Ursula.|$|E
60|$|Jardine {{looked about}} the terrace {{and his eyes}} twinkled. He noted the men's dinner jackets and the women's fashionable clothes. People <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> smoked.|$|R
5000|$|... "(Mike) Wallace of U.S.A. is {{much higher}} than you. I have <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> with him." ...|$|R
60|$|Adele's spirits rose as {{they got}} farther from Versailles, <b>and</b> they <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> cheerfully, but in low tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "What--{{a haunted}} room? a haunted room? I claim the adventure--and I--and I--and I," [...] cried a dozen guests, <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> {{at the same}} time.|$|E
6000|$|Their moralizing strain was {{interrupted}} by a demonstration {{from the rest of the}} party, who, after <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> together, suddenly joined their voices, and shouted at full pitch, ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Oh, come now, he said. Is it {{on account}} of that certain young lady and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind, Stevie. They were only <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then in {{an instant}} the lights flashed out again, the music began to play and the people began to <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>and</b> King Selim thought that maybe all that had just passed was only {{a bit of an}} ugly dream after all.|$|R
60|$|Noureddin availed {{himself of}} every {{opportunity}} to gaze upon her beauty, to <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> with her, <b>and</b> never would have left her side if his mother had not forced him.|$|R
60|$|But as it was, {{he was not}} happy. The {{recollection}} of his disobedience and sin would remain in his mind, and though he tried to <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh,</b> <b>and</b> play, as usual, his mind was not much at ease. In fact, he was secretly glad when the time arrived for going home.|$|R
60|$|She {{was only}} aware of voices above <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> or sailor calls being shouted out, or {{now and then}} of some one coming to look at her, and insisting on her taking food.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{the crowds}} thickened, {{and groups of}} men entered, <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> loudly. They were wholly at their ease, being plainly old and {{experienced}} members. They greeted each other with boisterous cries and powerful handshaking.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} about nineteen, {{full of the}} vigor and gaiety of youth and health; and so the two rode on their journey <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> as {{they might have been}} friends of long standing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They're {{too old for}} romps,' she retorted, 'an' it's {{only the}} {{beginning}} of things. I've seen what I've seen. Besides, they <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> in the passage going to their baths--such as took 'em.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never want}} them, I assure you. They <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> {{a great deal}} too much for me. Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday." ...|$|R
60|$|Philip {{felt himself}} very comfortable. He looked happily {{at the line}} of fires, with people grouped about them, and the colour of the flames against the night; {{at the end of the}} meadow was a line of great elms, and above the starry sky. The {{children}} <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> Athelny, a child among them, made them roar by his tricks and fancies.|$|R
60|$|Where {{they stood}} {{they could see}} Burnamy's face, {{flashing}} and flushing in the dance; {{at the end of}} the first piece he came to them, and remained <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> till the music began again.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{you must}} not think Mary was sitting still and gazing during this soliloquy. No, she was <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> {{apparently}} the most unconcerned spectator in the room. So passed the evening till the little company broke up.|$|E
60|$|He made Jim lean on him, {{and keep}} trying his foot, {{and pretty soon}} they found he could walk with it nearly {{the same as the}} other foot, and before they got to Jim's house they were <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> together.|$|E
50|$|This {{video was}} filmed in a {{decorated}} flat {{and on the}} streets around Soho. The band members <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> while Le Bon sings savagely to the camera. This video was re-edited for the video album, with some scenes replaced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you must}} not get ill now, Amelie. We should miss you terribly in the one {{hour of the day}} when we really live, the hour when we walk <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> if we can, on the river terrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember {{that you}} are liable to be made prisoners of war at any moment," [...] he said gravely. [...] "Wise men do not hide {{themselves}} and their vessel, an' then <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> that strangers may {{know where they are}} hidden." ...|$|R
60|$|All day Pivi played {{about in}} the river, as the natives do, {{throwing}} fruit and silvery showers of water at each other. When the sun set {{he went into the}} hut. But as he drew near he heard sweet voices <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> within.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{was quite}} sober, {{but he had}} been <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> and he was excited still. An evening of that sort {{reminded}} him of the old days in Paris. He was in high spirits. He took his pipe {{out of his pocket and}} filled it.|$|E
60|$|He {{had begun}} {{to walk in the}} {{direction}} of the disappearing secretary, and they soon came within sight of the rest of the house-party <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> on the lawn. They could see the tall figure and loose mane of the lion-hunter dominating the little group.|$|E
60|$|The gentlemen joined them; {{and soon}} after began the sweet {{expectation}} of a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed diffused, and they all stood about <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> every moment had its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt {{that there must be}} a struggle in Edmund's cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the effort so successfully made.|$|R
500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|R
60|$|He <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> noisily {{enough to}} Ida's friends, {{but he had}} seen enough at Northmoor to feel the difference, and he told his sister {{that there was not}} a lady amongst the whole kit of them, except Rose Rollstone, who was coming down for her holiday.|$|R
60|$|They lingered long {{over the}} tea-table, <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> {{and when they}} had finished, Phyllis {{discovered}} with surprise that it was nearly bedtime. The promised story was not omitted, however, and Phyllis, sitting on a little footstool at her brother's feet, looked up eagerly for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would have}} liked to see Mamma break a chair, wouldn't you, Mr. Pendennis?" [...] dear Blanche said with a sneer. She was angry because Pen was <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing</b> with Mamma, because Mamma had made a number of blunders in {{describing}} the house--for a hundred other good reasons.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They had {{travelled}} together, and {{had been}} much together, and had an abundance of subjects in common. In the midst of their <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughing,</b> the younger man made {{a reference to the}} leader's being always ready for any adventure; that one, or any other. He replied in these words: ...|$|E
50|$|Beside prose, Gurra left also {{a poetic}} {{collection}} named Dëshirë (Desire). The Albanian composer Kristo Kono {{used some of}} Gurra's poetry and composed songs, such as Fol e qesh moj sylarushe (<b>Talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> o you bright eyed girl"), which entered the classic reportorial of the urban lyric music in Albania.|$|R
60|$|Guarani consented, and {{for many}} years they lived {{together}} in peace and amity like one family, until at last there came a quarrel to divide them. And {{it was all about}} a parrot that could <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>laugh</b> <b>and</b> sing just like a man. A woman first found it in the forest, and not wishing to burden herself with the rearing of it she gave it to another woman. So well did it learn to talk from its new mistress that everybody admired it and it grew to be the talk of the village.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there were}} the daughters, Jane and Susan, who welcomed her with a {{hospitality}} truly amazing for city people. Jane was big-boned like her mother, but Susan was short and plump and merry like her father. Susan <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> Jane sat and listened and smiled, and Cynthia could not decide which she liked the best. And presently they all went {{into the dining room}} to supper, where there was another chandelier over the table. There was also real silver, which shone brilliantly on the white cloth--but there was nothing to eat.|$|R
