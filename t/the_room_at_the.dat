On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E

Emma was not punished because Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau may possibly have been with Emma and others in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Emma was nine years old at the time, and she would one day marry Alexander Liholiho, i. e. King Kamehameha IV.|$|E

5|$|The Waldorf State Apartments, {{consisting}} of nine suites, were {{located on the}} second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt {{and his wife had}} brought back from Europe. Francois V Bedroom was a reproduction of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palais de Fontainebleau, and over the years was occupied by the likes of Li Hung-Chang of China, Chowfa Maha Rajiravuth, Prince of Siam, and Albert of Saxe-Coburg. The apartments had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits. There were about 6,000 lights in the hotel, with as many as 1,000 were small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures. The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Company. The building was wired throughout on the system of the Interior Conduit and Insulation Company.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E

25|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Beethoven would not recover, his friends gathered to help and to pay their final respects. Beethoven's doctors conducted four minor operations to relieve ascites (abdominal swelling), of which the first resulted in infection, the others not. On 24 March he was given his last rites, and on 26 March he slipped into unconsciousness and died. While others, including Beethoven's brother and some friends, were probably in the house, Hüttenbrenner reports in his 1860 account that only he and Beethoven's sister-in-law were present in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of death.|$|E

25|$|Book-ending the Mappin Wing are the Tent Room—used for {{slightly}} less formal gatherings—and the ballroom—the centre of state life at Rideau Hall. It {{is in the}} latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place, members of the Cabinet are sworn in, ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials, and large-scale state dinners are held; as such, {{it is the second}} most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. A double-height space, it is lined with tall, arched windows between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable moulding trim surrounds most of the openings and, around the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, clear span vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which hangs a Waterford Crystal chandelier, presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada's role in World War II. Also, in an alcove to the south of the ballroom's main door is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.|$|E

His ultimate goal is to kill Roland Deschain: [...] "...most of all for the death of his mother, whom I once loved." [...] Flagg believes that he can only achieve these goals by killing Mordred and taking his birthmark-stained foot. Although he tries to befriend Mordred and pledge allegiance to him, Mordred telepathically senses Flagg's true motives and eats him, forcing him to rip out his eyes and tongue first.|$|E

In his only act, Goebel signed a {{proclamation}} to dissolve the militia called up by Taylor, which was ignored by the militia's Republican commander. Despite the care of 18 physicians, Goebel died the afternoon of February 3, 1900. Journalists recalled his last words as [...] "Tell my friends to be brave, fearless, and loyal to the common people." [...] Skeptic Irvin S. Cobb uncovered another story from some in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. On having eaten his last meal, the governor supposedly remarked [...] "Doc, that was a damned bad oyster." [...] In respect of Goebel's displeasure with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the governor's body was transported not by the L direct line, but circuitously from his hometown of Covington north across the Ohio River to Cincinnati, and then south to Frankfort on the Queen and Crescent Railroad.|$|E

The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In 2009, she received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Reading for her work in nuclear history. She was introduced to Scilla Elworthy, {{one of the leaders}} of the Oxford Research Group, one of the UK's leading advocates for alternatives to global conflict, in the 1980s by her friend, physicist Rudolf Peierls. Through Elworthy, Arnold became active in the movement for nuclear disarmament. [...] She participated in a series of video presentations on issues of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy for Talkworks, an organisation that focused on dangers associated with nuclear weapons. She also worked with television productions, including two BBC television documentaries on Windscale in 1990 and 2007, and a six-part documentary The Nuclear Age. which was cancelled by the BBC. In an episode of the BBC radio programme A Room with a View, [...] she visited <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Birmingham where Peierls had worked on the Frisch–Peierls memorandum.|$|E

Krasinski recalled accidentally insulting Greg Daniels while waiting to audition for the series, telling him, [...] "I hope [...] don't screw this up." [...] Daniels then introduced himself and told Krasinski who he was. Fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible, creating the original Pam hairstyle. In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim, with the producers partnering the different potential Pams and Jims (four of each) together to gauge their chemistry. When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski, he told her that she was his favorite Pam, to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim. Many actors originally filmed as extras in this episode would later go on to become supporting cast members in later episodes, and the two women wearing blue sweaters towards the back of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> staff meeting scene were actual accountants that worked on the production staff.|$|E

500|$|Pinter wrote The Hothouse in 1958, {{which he}} shelved for over 20 years (See [...] "Overtly {{political}} plays and sketches" [...] below). [...] Next he wrote The Dumb Waiter (1959), which premièred in Germany and was then produced {{in a double}} bill with <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hampstead Theatre Club, in London, in 1960. [...] It was then not produced often until the 1980s, {{and it has been}} revived more frequently since 2000, including the West End Trafalgar Studios production in 2007. [...] The first production of The Caretaker, at the Arts Theatre Club, in London, in 1960, established Pinter's theatrical reputation. [...] The play transferred to the Duchess Theatre in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances, receiving an Evening Standard Award for best play of 1960. [...] Large radio and television audiences for his one-act play A Night Out, along with the popularity of his revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention. [...] In 1964, The Birthday Party was revived both on television (with Pinter himself in the role of Goldberg) and on stage (directed by Pinter at the Aldwych Theatre) and was well received.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on May 10, 1993 that The Who's Tommy had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with Kiss of the Spider Woman {{for the most}} nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. However, {{as the result of}} an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the Los Angeles Times in 1997, he noted that [...] "this {{was one of the biggest}} disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. She glances across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help but wonder how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
500|$|The {{exterior}} featured loggias, balconies, gables, {{groups of}} chimneys, and tiled roofs. [...] One {{of the chief}} features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. [...] The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with an alcove off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which {{was used as a}} reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits.|$|E
