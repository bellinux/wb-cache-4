40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> {{stars in}} galaxies {{have been used}} as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red stars and <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars, while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> red stars and 0. 46 mag for <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> blue stars. <b>The</b> reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> stars are available (Figure 1).

Tulsidas himself attests this date in the Ramcharitmanas. He composed the epic over two years, seven months and twenty-six days, and completed the work in Vikram 1633 (1577 CE) on the Vivaha Panchami day (fifth day of <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> half of the Margashirsha month, which commenrates the wedding of Rama and his wife Sita).|$|E

30|$|However, {{the frontal}} bone is not <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel among <b>the</b> four pixels {{when the light}} source {{is far from the}} front. The side that faces the light is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel when <b>the</b> light source is {{completely}} from the side. Figure  2 b shows that <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the frontal bone but the right side that faces the light. Therefore, the straight line from the center to <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixel is not the bridge of the nose. Under this condition, human eyes are nonsymmetrical relative to the straight line from the center to <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> pixels. Thus, JEER uses Step 2 (necessary condition for existence of the eye region area) to determine whether human eyes might be present in the possible areas of the eye region chosen by Step 1.|$|R

5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, {{but it has}} an absolute magnitude of +1.41.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>brighter</b> {{an object}} appears, {{the lower the}} value of its magnitude, with <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> objects {{reaching}} negative values. The Sun has an apparent magnitude of −27, the full moon −13, <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> planet Venus measures −5, and Sirius, <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> visible star in the night sky, is at −1.5. An apparent magnitude can also be assigned to man-made objects in Earth orbit. <b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> satellite flares are ranked at −9, and the International Space Station, ISS, appears at a magnitude of −6. The scale is logarithmic, and defined such that each step of one magnitude changes the brightness by a factor of the fifth root of 100, or approximately 2.512. For example, a magnitude 1 star is exactly a hundred times brighter than a magnitude 6 star, as the difference of five magnitude steps corresponds to 2.5125 or 100.|$|R

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, small {{patches of}} pure water ice with an albedo {{as high as}} 80% are found {{on the surface of}} Callisto, surrounded by much darker material.

5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. <b>The</b> <b>bright,</b> smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that <b>the</b> <b>bright,</b> smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E
