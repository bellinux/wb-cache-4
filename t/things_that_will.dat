Iranian {{families}} {{usually have}} a Divan of Hafez in their house, {{and when they get}} together during the Nowruz or Yaldā holidays, they open the Divan to a random page and read the poem on it, which they believe to be an indication of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> happen in the future.|$|E
25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> help them to define {{where they want to}} go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E
25|$|What {{already has}} been {{observed}} directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with {{a high concentration of}} matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, or <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
500|$|The {{score was}} {{positively}} received by critics. [...] Judge Harold Jervais of DVD Verdict wrote how [...] " [...] Walker's wonderfully creepy and effective score are mixed {{together to form}} a very pleasing, almost organic-like whole". Mike Long of DVD Review said that [...] "Shirley Walker’s eerie score comes across powerfully with a wide spatial integration". Derek Germano of The Cinema Laser wrote that [...] "Walker's creepy musical score is really a winner, {{and is one of the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> help to make Final Destination a minor genre classic a few years down the road".|$|E
500|$|In its structure, {{the story}} of Alan Wake plays out {{similarly}} to a mystery television program, where each episode brings another {{piece of the puzzle}} to the main ongoing story, yet have a distinct plot of their own. As such, Alan Wake is organised into episodes, which include narrative and plot devices normally used in TV, such as cliffhangers {{at the end of the}} episodes. A prominent borrowing from television is the [...] "Previously on Alan Wake..." [...] recap sequence that opens each episode, and serve to [...] "refresh the player's memory and point to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> become relevant shortly." [...] A different song plays at the end of every episode, imitating certain TV shows that feature different music during each episode's closing credits.|$|E

2500|$|Keane {{have covered}} songs by music {{artists such as}} U2, Rufus Wainwright, Depeche Mode, Genesis, The Beatles, The Cult and Queen, with Tim saying: [...] "I guess it's classic song writing that is the main {{influence}} rather than one band in particular – we love people like Nick Drake who can convey so much emotion and write songs and albums that will be loved and cherished for many years – the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> be in people's record collections for their whole lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Award-winning {{composer}} Jeremy Soule {{was signed}} to compose the game's score. [...] "It {{will be a}} Star Wars score, but {{it will all be}} original, and probably the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> remain will be the Force themes and things like that," [...] Gallo said. Soule was unable to write a full orchestral score for Knights of the Old Republic due to technical limitations: [...] "At the time we only had an 8 megabit per second MIDI system. That was state of the art... I had to fool people into thinking they were hearing a full orchestra. I’d write woodwinds and drums, or woodwinds, horns and drums, or strings and drums and brass. I couldn’t run the whole orchestra at once, it was impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about}} the repercussions of the first season finale's events, stating, [...] "Magic as we know always comes with a price and we are {{introducing}} it to a world where {{it has never been}} before and I think that’s going to have unpredictable results. It’s going to affect everybody this season because that’s what’s more fun." [...] said Kitsis. On everyone in Storybrooke's memories returning Horowitz commented, [...] "One of the things that’s interesting to us to explore is this notion that just because the memories have returned {{does not mean that the}} past 28 years did not happen. Those memories, the Davids, the Mary Margarets, the Mr. Golds, all those people, who they were existed and what they did actually happened and those are the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> have to be dealt with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{their work}} is {{visually}} impressive and often controversial {{as a result of}} its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a [...] "revelation through concealment." [...] To his critics Christo replies, [...] "I am an artist, and I have to have courage... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist? [...] They all go away when they're finished. [...] Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> remain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginning}} of Indian Larry becoming {{known to the}} general public was his appearance in the Discovery Channel program, Motorcycle Mania II in 2001. [...] The program's primary focus was on customizer Jesse James, but it also featured different scenes profiling Indian Larry as he and the group (which included Jesse James, Chopper Dave, and Giuseppe Ronsin) set out to ride 1400 miles from Long Beach, California to the Sturgis 2001 Black Hills Classic in [...] Sturgis, South Dakota. [...] When one of the choppers breaks down in Southern Utah, Larry is shown performing his mechanical skills on the bike in a supermarket parking lot (when his own bike has magneto problems, Larry explains to the camera, [...] "If the bike is not running; if it's leaking oil; and if it's dirty. [...] That's about the only three <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> really get to me.") [...] The program also shows Larry displaying his famous neck tattoo, sharing snippets of his personal philosophy, and doing riding stunts – [...] this included him reclining back on his bike, Grease Monkey, [...] with his legs outstretched over the handlebars, and standing up on the saddle with his arms outstretched to the side as he speeds down the highway. [...] The group also visits Denver's Choppers in Las Vegas, Nevada (now in Reno) where Larry is shown meeting chopper builder, Mondo Porras for the first time.|$|E
