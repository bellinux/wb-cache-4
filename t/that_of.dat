40|$|We argue <b>that</b> {{the value}} <b>of</b> {{authenticity}} {{does not explain}} the value of self-knowledge.

Our thesis is <b>that,</b> for each <b>of</b> these species, the value <b>of</b> (<b>that</b> species <b>of)</b> authenticity does not (partially) explain the value of self-knowledge. Moreover, when it comes to spontaneity, the value <b>of</b> (<b>that</b> species <b>of)</b> authenticity conflicts with the value of self-knowledg...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} woolly mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between <b>that</b> <b>of</b> modern elephants and the woolly mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the woolly mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the woolly mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to woolly mammoths; however, since this location is so far south {{it is unlikely to}} be woolly mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the woolly mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E

5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives.

Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a closely orbiting binary star or <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a planet; it was found to be <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol {{is much higher than}} <b>that</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable {{even in the absence of}} π-acceptor ligands.|$|E
