5|$|In sum number place (Samunampure), {{the regions}} are of {{irregular}} shape and various sizes. The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. <b>The</b> <b>clues</b> are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The {{minimum number of}} clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site replaces sums with relations: <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> are symbols =, < and > showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not known whether {{this is the best}} possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two examples, notice that if the Sudoku is rotated 180 degrees, and <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> relabeled with the {{permutation}} (123456789) -> (987654321), it returns to the same Sudoku. Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180 degree rotational pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.|$|E
5|$|Deception {{and problem}} solving are central themes in this novel as both the thief and the central adult players {{use a variety of}} ways to hide the truth while the {{children}} employ a series of mathematical and problem-solving concepts to piece together <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> to the puzzle. In addition, Calder and Petra develop a special friendship and certain respect for the value of art.|$|E
50|$|A clue {{without a}} home. <b>The</b> <b>clue</b> is hidden in another {{letterbox}} (similar to clues for a bonus boxes), but the letterboxer that finds <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> {{is expected to}} move <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> to another nearby letterbox. <b>The</b> cuckoo <b>clue</b> typically contains directions to limit how far <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> should travel {{to find a new}} home.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clue</b> {{is given}} by word of mouth, or typed up, but a letterboxer can only receive <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> from <b>the</b> planter.|$|R

5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica experiences persistent and vivid nightmares of the students who died in the bus crash, and she attempts to piece together <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> she's gotten from these dreams. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) are forced to work together on a science experiment.|$|E
5|$|Three contestants each {{take their}} place behind a lectern, with the {{returning}} champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!. The material for <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> covers {{a wide variety of}} topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes {{before the start of the}} round.|$|E
5|$|At Castle Brunwald, Indy rescues Henry, but {{learns that}} Elsa and Donovan are {{actually}} {{working with the}} Nazis, and are using him to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in Hatay, while waiting with Sallah for the Joneses. The Joneses escape from Castle Brunwald. Henry tells Indy that to reach the Grail, one must face three booby traps and his diary contains <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> to guide them through the challenges safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a book burning rally in Berlin. They then board a Zeppelin to leave Germany, but the Nazis soon discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a parasite biplane. They crash while engaging in a dogfight with Luftwaffe fighters.|$|E
50|$|To make it {{even more}} {{difficult}} to get <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> word, a time limit (3 minutes usually; occasionally between 2:00-3:30 minutes) is placed on each game. <b>The</b> <b>clue</b> words are usually written on pieces of paper and kept in canisters filled with gunpowder, and if the contestant fails to reach the canister in the allotted time <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> word explodes and the contestant loses the challenge. Unlike the First Phase, players are not locked in a cage if they fail to win <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> word.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clue</b> DVD Game is not <b>the</b> first <b>Clue</b> game {{to include}} an {{interactive}} component. It was preceded by a Parker Brothers game called <b>the</b> <b>Clue</b> VCR Mystery Game, which is now out-of-print and collectible. This precursor to <b>the</b> <b>Clue</b> DVD Game saw some popularity, because it spawned a sequel, called Clue II Murder in Disguise - A VCR Mystery Game. Both of these VCR games {{were published in the}} mid to late 1980's.|$|R

5|$|Madeline Ferguson (Lee) {{meets with}} James Hurley and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) at the RR Diner. They discuss Laura's death; Hurley and Hayward believe Laura hid a diary {{at her home}} and want Ferguson, who is now staying there, to look for it. They leave as Jennings and Shelly arrive; Hank is seated at another table and pulls Jennings aside to ask to start working in order to regain her trust. Meanwhile, using a {{photograph}} from Renault's home and <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> from Cooper's dream, the investigators find a log cabin in the woods that {{they believe to be}} the scene of the murder; on the floor Cooper finds a fragment of a One Eyed Jacks casino chip that matches the piece found in Laura's stomach, and Truman finds Waldo, the caged myna bird.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E
5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>clues,</b> Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.|$|E
50|$|In essence, a cryptic clue {{leads to}} its answer {{as long as}} it is read in the right way. What <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> appears to say when read {{normally}} (the surface reading) is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> answer. <b>The</b> challenge is to find the way of reading <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> that leads to the solution.|$|R
5000|$|The hearer infers the {{intention}} from <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> and <b>the</b> context-mediated information. The hearer must interpret <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> {{taking into account}} the context, and surmise what the speaker intended to communicate.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{syndicated}} version {{found in}} most daily newspapers (under the official title Jumble, That Scrambled Word Game) has four base anagrams, two of five letters and two of six, followed by a clue {{and a series of}} blank spaces in which the answer to <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> fits. <b>The</b> answer to <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> is generally a pun of some sort. A weekly [...] "kids version" [...] of the puzzle features a 3-letter word plus three 4-letter words. In order to find the letters that are in the answer to <b>the</b> given <b>clue,</b> <b>the</b> player must unscramble all four of the scrambled words; the letters that are in <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> will be circled. The contestant then unscrambles the circled letters to form the answer to <b>the</b> <b>clue.</b> An alternate workaround is to solve some of the scrambled words, figure out the answer to <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> without all <b>the</b> letters, then use the [...] "extra" [...] letters as aids to solve the remaining scrambled words.|$|R
5|$|The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001. On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{worked hard}} to keep {{the ending of the}} episode a secret. While it was in production, David Silverman was the only animator who knew who the culprit was. Wes Archer, director of the episode, was initially unaware of the solution and directed the episode up until the conclusion. When it was time to animate the ending of the show, Silverman and Archer waited {{until the end of the}} summer of 1995 to work on it. They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was. The table read for the episode also ended before the third act. The writers had wanted <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.|$|E
5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of <b>the</b> <b>clues.</b> As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E

50|$|Jumble {{is a word}} puzzle with a clue, {{a drawing}} {{illustrating}} <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> {{and a set of}} words, each of which is “jumbled” by scrambling its letters. A solver reconstructs the words, and then arranges letters at marked positions in the words to spell the answer phrase to <b>the</b> <b>clue.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clue</b> and illustration always provide hints about the answer phrase. The answer phrase frequently uses a homophone or pun.|$|R
5000|$|Ken & Tina {{initially}} arrived 3rd {{but missed}} <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> directing {{them to the}} Pit Stop, having arrived there by chance while searching for <b>the</b> <b>clue.</b> They were required to retrieve <b>the</b> missed <b>clue</b> at <b>the</b> end of the Detour {{and return to the}} Pit Stop. This did not affect their placement.|$|R
5|$|When Marceau {{believes}} she has solved the murder, Poirot gathers the passengers and poses {{a series of}} questions to Marceau about <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> found. He goes on to reveal three possible solutions to Ratchett's death. The first two are identical to the novel. Poirot suggests that an assassin may have come aboard the train during the night, killed Cassetti, and then escaped the train, which is supported by evidence such as a bloodied stiletto with fingerprints that do not match anyone on the train. The second solution pieces together a number of clues showing that all of the trains' passengers and the conductor, Pierre Michel, are responsible for the murder, to which they confess.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Kidnappers violently {{take the}} Secret Service chief M {{from his house}} and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun {{had been sent to}} {{sabotage}} a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E

5000|$|Times {{style is}} to always {{capitalize}} {{the first letter}} of a clue, regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> is a complete sentence or whether the first word is a proper noun. On occasion, this is used to deliberately create difficulties for the solver; e.g., in <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> [...] "John, for one" [...] it is ambiguous as to whether <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> is referring to the proper name John or to the slang term for a bathroom.|$|R

5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E
