5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, {{noted that}} some geographers divided <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> by rivers (<b>the</b> Nile and the Don), thus {{considering}} them [...] "islands".

5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in a country and for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E

Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.|$|E
