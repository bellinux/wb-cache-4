The methodology is exemplified through a simple algebraic system, and applied to a simple thermodynamic, mechanical and heat transfer modeling of a single-stage vapor compression refrigeration system.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method for haptic synthesis of viscoelastic responses which employs a dual-channel haptic interface. It has motors that generate torque independently from velocity and brakes that generate viscous torque independently from position. This way, {{twice as many}} states are directly accessible, which reduces reliance on observation and feedback. Torquegenerating actuators, e. g. dc motors, are well known. For the viscous actuators, we use eddy current brakes as programmable, linear, non-contact, physical dampers. By decomposing a mechanical impedance to be realized into viscous and elastic components, we can dedicate each actuator to that component it is ideally suited to synthesize, dampers for the viscous component, and motors for the elastic component. The decomposition is in general not unique so it possible to select <b>the</b> option that <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advantage</b> of <b>the</b> hardware. Experimental results show that this technique can render a variety of viscoelastic models without the artifacts that can occur when synthesizing viscous components on conventional haptic interfaces. The synthesized mechanical impedances have guaranteed passivity, and can have arbitrarily high or low viscous and elastic components. ...|$|R

We propose here to extend this experiment to different modality-impaired groups of adults and children, namely: (i) to blind and impaired-hearing adults vs. normal hearing and sighted ones; (ii) and to impaired-hearing vs. normal hearing children (7 - 11 year-old). Blind and sighted adults had globally comparable results in the auditory modality, though individually less categorical for the blind. In the visual condition, hearingimpaired adults had the same delayed performance as normal. In addition the same hearing-impaired adults were tested when practicing French Cued Speech (CS). Their performance indicated clearly that, with CS, they succeeded in the identification task as precociously as normal hearing in the auditory condition. Normal hearing children obtained the same ranking in their perceptual modalities, i. e. A>AV>V, but with a global delay of 20 - 30 ms compared to adults. Hearingimpaired children obtained again an anticipatory gain with CS comparable to the audio of normal children. The conclusion is that each group <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>advantage</b> of <b>the</b> natural timing of their available sensory modalities, by the face, the hand and the ear.

40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY: This phenomenological {{study is}} aimed at {{illuminating}} nurses' lived experience {{of the process of}} preceptoring and the meaning of preceptorship in a Swedish context. METHODS: Seventeen nurses from the North of Sweden with varied previous experience of preceptorship volunteered to participate. Their narratives, describing their experience of being a personal preceptor for a student nurse during practical training on a hospital ward in the third year of a 3 -year diploma programme within a university college of nursing in Sweden, were transcribed verbatim. A phenomenological-hermeneutic interpretation disclosed the themes 'sheltering the students when learning' and 'facilitating the students' learning', together with eight sub-themes, which created an understanding of the meaning of preceptorship. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: The meaning of preceptorship was understood as reducing the risk of the students learning helplessness and empowering the students when learning in practice. The meaning of preceptorship highlighted the need for further preceptor support and development {{of the role of the}} preceptor. On the basis of the findings, suggestions were made to increase the preceptors' awareness of values in nursing practice and use of pedagogical strategies in the process of preceptoring.
