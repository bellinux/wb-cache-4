5|$|In 1991, bodies {{believed}} to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. <b>The</b> <b>grave</b> had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> was originally found. Once <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated {{the height and width}} of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact. A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.|$|E
