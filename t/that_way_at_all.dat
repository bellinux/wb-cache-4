Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E

I think what’s confused in Reese’s head is she has misinterpreted a friendship. Zach {{is one of}} the [...] people who have not kicked her to the curb, so to speak, in Pine Valley." [...] Carruthers said that Reese is a confused and insecure person. [...] "She has never wavered in her commitment to Bianca," [...] she said. [...] "It’s solid, Reese has just had a lot of emotional stuff hit. Her family is rejecting and judging her... in both her family and Bianca’s." [...] In specific response to viewers being upset at the appearance that Reese was considering leaving Bianca for Zach, Carruthers stated, [...] "She is not considering it. That’s the audience rewriting what’s there. It’s not being written <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Reese has never wavered in what she wants." [...] Carruthers acknowledged that Reese leaving Bianca for a man would upset viewers, but that [...] "it's never been about that". [...] "I don’t know how to stress this more," [...] she said. [...] "Never has she played a moment of, 'I want Zach more than I want Bianca,' or 'I would leave Bianca for Zach.' He has literally just been a friend. Look, we tantalize in this genre. We do it whether we do it with heterosexual or homosexual couples. It’s what the genre is." ...|$|E

After 1945, in SFR Yugoslavia the census of 1948 did not officially recognize the Bunjevci (nor Šokci), and instead merged their data with the Croats, even if a person would self-declare as a Bunjevac or Šokac.The Yugoslav communist government counted Bunjevci (and Šokci) as part of Croatian national corpus.Proponents of a distinct Bunjevac ethnicity regard this time as another dark period of encroachment on their identity, and feel that this assimilation did not help in the preservation of their language. The censuses of 1953 and 1961 also listed all declared Bunjevci as Croats. The 1971 population census listed the Bunjevci separately under the municipal census in Subotica upon the personal request of the organization of Bunjevci in Subotica. It listed 14,892 Bunjevci or 10.15% of the population of Subotica. Despite this, the provincial and federal authorities listed the Bunjevci as Croats, together with the Šokci and considered them <b>that</b> <b>way</b> officially <b>at</b> <b>all</b> occasions. In 1981 the Bunjevci made a similar request - it showed 8,895 Bunjevci, or 5.7% of the total population of Subotica.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Presented {{is a novel}} active-balun {{low noise}} {{amplifier}} (LNA) with forestage-poststage gain controls for VHF/UHF mobile-TV tuners. It consists of two passive attenuators inter-operating with an active core to optimize the RF performances under different reception scenarios. The forestage is a MOS-based attenuator configured in a <b>way</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> attenuation levels, a broadband input impedance match can be obtained. The interstage is a single-to-differential amplifier exploiting a common-source common-gate structure for noise cancellation. The poststage is a capacitor (CAP) -based attenuator, which adjusts the dynamicity of the output signal before driving the mixer. With this forestage-poststage gain controls the system noise figure and linearity can be easily traded at different gain levels. Optimized in a 0. 18 -µm CMOS process the LNA attains 0. 85 -dBm IIP 3 at a maximum voltage gain of 26 dB, a 37 -dB gain range with a 6 -dB step size, and an average noise figure of 2. 9 dB.

But of the rest, a large party turned toward London, in hopes of pillage and plunder. Others remained near the Tower. This last party, as soon as the king and his attendants had gone to Mile-End, succeeded in forcing their way in through the gates, which, it seems, had not been left properly guarded, and thus gained possession of the Tower.

40|$|Abstract: The aims {{of current}} {{research}} programme are itemised as {{to design a}} research rig simulates the desalination heat exchange process, assess the feasibility of enhanced heat transfer mechanisms in MSF plant, examining actual brine water that typifies real process conditions, study the influence of flow speeds on fouling resistance {{and the effect of}} tube diameter on its behaviour. The first apparatus designed is test-Rig (A), consists mainly of a cubic box simulating the steam condenser. Six horizontally tube are mounted, through which the coolant solution is flowing and the vapour from a boiler source is condensed outside the tubes, but inside the box. These tubes are aluminium-brass made. The test rig is instrumented in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> temperature <b>at</b> <b>all</b> important points in the apparatus can be monitored, as well as the flow rate of all the fluid streams. The thermocouples are inserted in the important points. Experimental results are discussed for both smooth and corrugated tube, when applying fresh and real brine water on different flow speeds. This apparatus has to be redesigned, since buckling, as well as cracks developed in the plixcy-glass box’s wall due to thermal stresses, existence of mutual heat transfer between tested tubes, existence of non-uniform distribution of steam through-out the box, venting valves need to be added to water circulation loop, modification of pumping system through automation and redesign a water reservoir to keep the inlet temperature to the rig constant.
