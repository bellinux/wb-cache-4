5|$|The Vietnam War (1955–1975) was an {{important}} issue on college campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. As a belated response to Vietnam War protesters who believed that funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) made the university part of the military–industrial complex, <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> Research Institute split from Stanford University in 1970. The organization subsequently changed its name from <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> Research Institute to SRI International in 1977.|$|E

50|$|The harbour is {{also known}} for the tragedy of <b>the</b> Mary <b>Stanford</b> {{lifeboat}}. At 6:45 am {{on the morning of}} 15 November 1928, <b>the</b> Mary <b>Stanford</b> from <b>the</b> Rye Harbour RNLI station responded needlessly to a Latvian steamer in distress. The crew of <b>the</b> Mary <b>Stanford</b> did not know that the vessel had already been rescued by another lifeboat and, in heavy rain and seas, all of the seventeen-man crew of <b>the</b> Mary <b>Stanford</b> were drowned. <b>The</b> reason for this is still somewhat contested. The bodies of all but the Coxswain's son, John Head, were found and buried. A memorial service in honour of <b>the</b> Mary <b>Stanford</b> and its crew takes place every year in the village.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech's third {{drive of}} the quarter started from its 23-yard line. The first two plays of the drive were stopped for {{negative}} gain, then Taylor completed a 17-yard throw to Jarret Boykin for a first down. Tech couldn't gain another first down, however, and punted to Stanford, which started from its 13-yard line. As in Virginia Tech's previous drive, <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> offense began with a play that lost yardage, but it made up the failure with a running play that gained sixyards and a passing play from Luck to Fleener for a first down at <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> 32-yard line. On the quarter's final play, running back Tyler Gaffney gained sevenyards. With one quarter remaining, Stanford led 26–12.|$|E

5|$|As {{a reward}} for winning the ACC Championship, the Hokies {{received}} {{a position in the}} 2011 Orange Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game.

Florida State, meanwhile, was selected to participate in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Bowl against South Carolina. In that game, held New Year's Eve, the Seminoles defeated South Carolina, 26–17.|$|E
5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to succeed in the second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. <b>The</b> <b>Stanford</b> defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying him time to pass the ball accurately.|$|E

5|$|Stanford's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense began {{from its}} 20-yard line. The Hokies gained their initial first {{down of the}} game when quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{completed}} a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale on the drive's third play, but Tech was unable to gain another. Tech punted from its 43-yard line, and the kick was downed at <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> 5-yard line, where the Cardinal offense started work. Two rushing plays were stopped for no gain, then Luck attempted a passing play on third down. Because {{the line of scrimmage}} was so close to <b>the</b> <b>Stanford</b> goal line, Luck had to move into his own end zone to attempt the pass. Under pressure from the Virginia Tech defense, he threw to Derek Hall, who caught the ball in the end zone and was tackled before getting out. The result of the play was a safety, a 2-point defensive score for Virginia Tech.|$|E
