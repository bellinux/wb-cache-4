5000|$|The {{site for}} the bridge was {{surveyed}} in 1813. The bridge crossed from north of Port Deposit to just below Rock Run stream in Harford County. The bridge crossed Steel, Roberts and Wood Islands. Construction of the bridge was started in 1817. [...] The bridge was constructed by Theodore Burr, who had just completed work on four Susquehanna bridges in Pennsylvania. The bridge design used his Burr arch truss. [...] "This ultimate achievement of Burr's on the Susquehanna, having in all eighteen 200-foot <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> wooden spans, eight between the west shore and a first island, two between that and a second island, and eight more between that and the east shore, and a total length of 4,170 feet, was to be performed in two years. For the years between 1812 and 1818 Burr's <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> had been an increasing triumph.". The bridge opened in 1818.|$|E

5000|$|The Wall {{brothers}} {{developed a}} new wrought iron <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridge which was subsequently patented as the [...] "Champion Wrought Iron Arch Bridge." [...] The patented design reportedly [...] "played {{a key role in}} the history of their company." [...] The brothers sought investors to help them exploit their new design. In 1872, they formed the [...] "The Champion Iron Bridge and Manufacturing Company" [...] in partnership with Albert Israel Bailey. The company opened a fabrication shop in Hamilton, Ohio, and in 1875 built a larger shop in Wilmington, Ohio. The business was incorporated in 1878, and Zimri Wall left the business in 1880. In 1881, the company changed its name to the Champion Bridge Company in 1881 and began to also manufacture farm implements, iron fences, and some machinery. In 1893, the company moved to its present location on East Sugartree Street in Wilmington. [...] The company was among the first to use and promote steel for the construction of smaller highway bridges.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When the {{scaffold}} construction method is applied on long-span steel <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridges, reasonable {{setting of the}} temporary pier elevation has significant influence on assembly linearis and safety assembly of long-span steel <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridges with semi-cantilever. In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} manufacturing linearis steel trussed beam bridge and steel truss beam linearis changing during building process, the calculation of temporary pier elevation was studied systematically, and practical function was deduced. Then, the method was applied to a long-span steel <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridge. The obtained result by in-situ assembly and dismantling presents that: 50 mm preserved method is considered in this paper, which can provide convenience for removing the temporary pier. At the same time, the rationality and reliability of the presented approach are verified. It also can provide reference for similar bridge construction...|$|E

Taking {{a double}} span- swallows-type CFST (concrete-filled steel tubular) <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridge as an {{engineering}} example; a spatial {{finite element analysis}} model is established to calculate its dynamic characteristic. The seismic responses in different earthquake input directions are calculated based on the elastic dynamic time history method. Results show that: the out-plane stability of the bridge is weaker {{than that of the}} in-plane; the torsion resistance ability of the bridge deck is smaller than that of the arch ribs; the axial force-Fx, shear force-Fz and bending moment-My of the bridge are mainly controlled by longitudinal seismic forces, whereas the shear forces-Fy, bending moment-Mz and torque-Mx are mainly controlled by transverse seismic forces; vertical seismic force has a considerable effect on internal forces of the bridge, so it can not be ignored in seismic design...|$|E

40|$|<b>Trussed</b> <b>arch</b> bridges are {{commonly}} used to attain big spans. They are efficient structures that offer {{a wide range of}} geometries, materials, and topologies. This thesis studies the influence of the geometry and topology of arch bridges on both their structural performance relayed by the maximum deflection and their structural weight. Various materials are also considered to calculate the embodied carbon emission and investigate the environmental impact of arch bridges. Gustave Eiffel's Garabit Viaduct is used as a design precedent for this study. 2 -D and 3 -D parametric models of the arch bridge are realized using Grasshopper [8]. Changing the geometric parameters in addition to the topology enables the investigation of the bridge's performance. The cross sections are automatically optimized in each case. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization process was run on the bridge to examine the tradeoffs between the deflection and the self-weight. The weight-oriented optimization allows saving more than 60 % of the weight compared to the original structure. Analyzing the different resulting designs proves that increasing the depth at the arch's crown and the depth {{at the base of the}} arch leads to better deflection results. It also demonstrates that using a denser truss structure leads to a lighter structure. by Khaoula Msaaf. Thesis: M.

40|$|Rapidly {{deployable}} mobile bridges are {{of direct}} relevance to {{military and civilian}} agencies. The US Army uses such bridges in {{a broad range of}} applications including assault, tactical, and general communication. Civilian use extends from temporary infrastructure improvements during natural disasters to planned situations that are equally critical. This paper describes a modular bridge system developed primarily for use in assault scenarios where rapid deployment is vital, but this design concept is also relevant in civil applications. The robust metallic design of the bridge is based on an aluminum <b>trussed</b> <b>arch</b> reinforced by steel cables. The segmental form of the structure allows it to be folded into a compact package for transportation in a standard 40 ft container, which facilitates shipping by road, rail, sea, or air (C- 130 transport aircraft). The bridge segments also facilitate adaptation of the bridge to different spans ranging from 8 m to 32 m. The load rating for these spans varies between 100 T and 40 T respectively. The preferred deployment approach for the assault configuration uses a scissor method in conjunction with a winching mechanism mounted on an auxiliary bridge guide. Compared to more conventional techniques, this method reduces the demands on the bridge launcher. The complete system provides an integrated solution to cover a broad spectrum of bridging applications. Extensive computer analysis was used to refine and optimize the components in the bridge. Structural testing of components during the design stage also helped guide the design process, and operational and load testing of a prototype system using strain gauging confirmed the integrity of the final design...|$|E

40|$|Studies on dynamic {{impact of}} {{high-speed}} trains on long-span bridges {{are important for}} the design and evaluation of high-speed railway bridges. The use of the dynamic load factor (DLF) {{to account for the}} impact effect has been widely accepted in bridge engineering. Although the field monitoring studies are the most dependable way to study the actual DLF of the bridge, according to previous studies there are few field monitoring data on high-speed railway <b>truss</b> <b>arch</b> bridges. This paper presents an evaluation of DLF based on field monitoring and finite element simulation of Nanjing DaShengGuan Bridge, which is a high-speed railway <b>truss</b> <b>arch</b> bridge with the longest span throughout the world. The DLFs in different members of steel <b>truss</b> <b>arch</b> are measured using monitoring data and simulated using finite element model, respectively. The effects of lane position, number of train carriages, and speed of trains on DLF are further investigated. By using the accumulative probability function of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution, the probability distribution model of DLF is proposed, based on which the standard value of DLF within 50 -year return period is evaluated and compared with different bridge design codes...|$|R

The branching of branches of solutions rarely occurs in real applications for which imperfections tend to distort these sharp transitions.

The bifurcation diagram is carried out numerically. It is shown that the <b>truss</b> <b>arch</b> system is a simple example of coexistence of disjoint branches.

The analytic solutions are derived and the connection of the branches is studied...|$|R
