He had only five points and 146 PIM combined between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons.</b> McGrattan made headlines midway through the 2007–08 campaign when he fought teammate and goaltender Ray Emery – himself a noted fighter – in practice. McGrattan's on-ice performance had suffered over time in Ottawa {{as a result of}} a worsening drinking problem he had developed beginning early in his career with Binghamton.|$|E

5|$|Illingworth was {{selected}} to make his first-class début for Victoria against Tasmania at Kardinia Park in Geelong in February 1962. His selection had generated controversy since he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Melbourne district cricket in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> prior to his selection. One of the occasions in district cricket, he had been no-balled three times in one over. At the time, Tasmania {{were not in the}} Sheffield Shield competition, so it was a one-off match.|$|E
5|$|Marsh only {{played in}} two more {{first-class}} matches, which came in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> following his no-balling. In a later season, the touring England cricket team objected to his selection in an opposition team.

In later years, Marsh turned to alcohol and was briefly jailed for assault. He {{was killed in a}} brawl outside a pub; two men were charged with manslaughter but were acquitted.|$|E

Sense8 was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{was heavily}} {{favored to win}} the contest, as the point spread favored Nebraska by 16 points to 17 points. Heading into the Orange Bowl, the two teams {{presented}} a study in contrasts. The Cornhuskers boasted a string of 28 seasons with nine or more victories, received 28 straight bowl bids, spent 256 consecutive weeks ranked in the AP poll, and had recorded 214 straight sellouts in their 75,000-capacity home stadium. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, had a bowl streak dating back just three years, to the 1993 Independence Bowl, and while the game was Nebraska's 16th Orange Bowl, it was Virginia Tech's first. Nebraska and Virginia Tech were among the winningest seven teams in Division I-A college football during <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> prior to the Orange Bowl. Virginia Tech had 20 wins in those two seasons, while Nebraska had 22 victories.|$|E

5|$|Returning after {{a one-year}} hiatus {{and despite the}} return of players such as Cooney Weiland, Finnigan, Howe and Kilrea, the Senators {{finished}} with the worst record {{in the league in}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> that followed. Attendance was poor, the club only drawing well when the league's other three Canadian teams came to town. Frank Finnigan recalled that they frequently played home games before small crowds of 3,500 to 4,000. 1932–33 saw the return of Cy Denneny to Ottawa as coach. He would last only the one season. In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team and move it to Baltimore, but the option was never exercised.

5|$|The club {{were unable}} to match this success in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>seasons</b> that followed, and {{finished}} in 11th and 12th places respectively. The 1949–50 season brought another disappointing league campaign. The season started well, as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league {{at the turn of}} the year. Their form declined thereafter, and they finished eighth. This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup, as they reached their second final (their first at Wembley), against Arsenal. They {{were unable to}} win their first FA Cup; two goals from Arsenal striker Reg Lewis meant Liverpool lost 2–0.|$|E
