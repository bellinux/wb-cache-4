5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. <b>The</b> <b>marked</b> male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

50|$|Released for the 1993 model year, <b>the</b> Lincoln <b>Mark</b> VIII {{continued}} <b>the</b> role of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VII as a luxury-oriented grand touring coupe.

5|$|From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace {{travelled}} {{through the}} Malay Archipelago or East Indies (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens {{for sale and}} to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation {{can be found in}} the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology. His observations of <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace line.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E
5|$|In the {{transfer}} window, Arsenal sold several fringe players, notably Nelson Vivas to Internazionale and Sylvinho to Celta Vigo; goalkeeper John Lukic was released following {{his decision to}} retire. Goalkeeper Richard Wright was signed as an earmarked understudy to David Seaman, while midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst and striker Francis Jeffers were purchased in big money moves from Rangers and Everton respectively. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> signing for Arsenal was the acquisition of defender Sol Campbell, who moved from local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer.|$|E
50|$|After {{having made}} {{plans for the}} {{continued}} development of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I into <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IV, <b>the</b> Tank Supply Committee (the institute planning and controlling British tank production) in December 1916 ordered the design of two new types: <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> V and <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> VI. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> V should embody the most advanced features that could still be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I hull. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> VI should abandon the old hull entirely, reflecting only some general principles of the older tank.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 {{mine was}} an aircraft-launched, antisubmarine torpedo {{developed}} by the Brush Development Company during World War II. It was developed as a backup for <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24 mine due to apprehensions regarding <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24's acoustic steering. Three prototypes of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 were built and tested in 1943; results were satisfactory. Production of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 30 was never undertaken due {{to the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 24 mine's acoustic steering.|$|R
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Lawton PD is {{especially}} pleased that “prominent crimes”, such as robbery and homicide have declined nearly 50%. Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and ears of the police department in the areas they represent. They also share tips on how to protect themselves with their neighbors at regular neighborhood meetings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>marked</b> {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} was slightly more luxurious than the Custom.

5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} of his gothic rock band <b>the</b> <b>Marked,</b> singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, {{to return to his}} native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning {{themselves}} with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live {{for the first time on}} July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{launching}} of the Invincibles to just after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired. The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> change in Britain's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships. The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the Entente cordiale in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente. Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new dreadnought-type design. Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers, Japan (bolstered by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the USA. These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the Dreadnought, ensured that she rather than the Invincible became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms-race sparked by the Dreadnought.|$|E

5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, Square Enix {{announced}} {{they had decided}} not to use PlayOnline for Final Fantasy XIV due to <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> decrease of content on the service.

However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play Final Fantasy XI. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from Final Fantasy XI in Final Fantasy XIV. The termination date of service for Final Fantasy XI and PlayOnline for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 was March 2016.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative case or a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

Once the attacking force entered the village, the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours. During the assault, 22 civilians were killed in their homes or back yards. In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas, Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets. <b>The</b> <b>marked</b> houses were looted and torched by the TO and paramilitaries. Authority in the village was turned over to Ljuban Devetak, a member of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries. He was styled as the commander of the village, but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region. Over the following week, 23 more civilians were killed by the paramilitaries and the TO troops in improvised detention facilities. The improvised prisons were also used for torture and abuse of captives, including war rape, causing serious injuries to 18 civilians.|$|E
