5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} the British in 1812 led <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> conflict with Indians in the Northwest. Harrison briefly served as a major general in the Kentucky militia until the U.S. government commissioned him to command the Army of the Northwest on September 17, 1812. Although Harrison received federal military pay for his service, he also collected a territorial governor's salary from September until December 28, 1812, when he formally resigned as governor and continued his military service.|$|E
5|$|The short segment from McCowan Road to Markham Road {{remained}} {{closed for}} over a year, as locals feared the funneling of traffic onto Main Street, which is named Markham Road south of the freeway. Both Markham and McCowan were widened to four lanes between Highway407 and Steeles Avenue at this time. This did not alleviate concerns, but on June 24, 1999, the extension opened <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> protest regardless.|$|E

5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{existence}} or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed {{as early as}} 1956 {{in the form of}} the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area.|$|E
5|$|I-495 forms a wide loop {{around the}} outer edge of Greater Boston. Other major interstates in Massachusetts include I-291, I-391, I-84, I-195, I-395, I-290, and I-190. Major non-interstate {{highways}} in Massachusetts include U.S. Routes 1, 3, 6, and 20, and state routes 2, 3, 9, 24, and 128. A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid 20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston, first proposed in 1948. Opposition <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> construction grew, and in 1970 Governor Francis W. Sargent issued a general prohibition on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in the Boston area. A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the Big Dig, brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, {{the project}} was called into {{question}} when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film. Scott rewrote the script {{in an attempt to}} reduce the film's budget by $20 million, but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> budgetary concerns, and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, , White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative, as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project, with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground.|$|E

5|$|Late on November1, a large eye redeveloped, and the JTWC {{estimated}} Krosa attained peak 1minute sustained {{winds of}} 185km/h (115mph). Early the next day, the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). Later, increasing wind shear caused {{the eye to}} deteriorate, and Krosa began slowing about 260km (160mi) east-southeast of Hong Kong after reaching {{the western edge of}} the subtropical ridge. After remaining nearly stationary, Krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a new ridge. The convection continued to weaken due <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> shear and cooler waters from upwelling, and Krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November3. The next day, the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection. Also on November4, the JMA downgraded Krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast. The system dissipated at 0000UTC on November5.|$|E
5|$|Lemon {{began the}} 1955 {{season with a}} 5–0 record in April, {{but he was the}} only Cleveland {{starting}} pitcher with a winning record that month. His 18 wins tied for the most in the AL that year. He recorded five complete games through May 30 but none after that date. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining the organization. Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore Orioles on September 11, 1956, and he also hit a home run that day. He finished the season with a 20–14 record, the last of his seven career 20-win seasons, and led the AL in complete games (21). On August 13, 1957, it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season. Lemon ended the season with a record of 6–11, his first losing record since 1946.|$|E
5|$|Moving very little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due <b>to</b> <b>continued</b> shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to a burst of convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, {{the depression}} organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
