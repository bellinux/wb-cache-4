2500|$|After {{they were}} signed to BBC Two, {{they became the}} hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC style series What Not to Wear in 2001, where they used their {{knowledge}} on fashion and harsh comments to reform the appearances and style of the participants on the show. The duo became instantly renowned for their poking and prodding of the contestants, their straight-talking advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. The editor of ELLE, Sarah Bailey, has stated [...] "You just don't expect posh girls to grab your tits, call your trousers 'too clitty' and use words like 'pussy pelmet' but they do. You are so shocked by what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{by the time you}} have recovered and thought of something to say they have whipped you out of your jeans and eased you into a Lycra cat suit." [...] They have stated that their relationship is more like a marriage and that being total opposites, they balance each other out. They cannot imagine working without each other and have even considered taking insurance out on their television partnership should something unforeseen happen. Woodall and Constantine have been accused of being patronising, but reject these claims.|$|E

60|$|And meanwhile--as {{was to be}} {{expected}} from a generation which abhors torture, labours for the reformation of criminals, and even doubts whether it should not abolish capital punishment--a shaking of the heavens is abroad, of which we shall hear more and more, as the years roll on--a general inclination to ask whether Holy Scripture really endorses the Middle-age notions of future punishment in endless torment? Men are writing and speaking on this matter, not merely with ability and learning, but with a piety, and reverence for Scripture which (rightly or wrongly employed) must, and will, command attention. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it is not those who deny these notions who disregard the letter of Scripture, but those who assert them; that they are distorting the plain literal text, in order to make Scripture fit the writings of Dante and Milton, when they translate into 'endless torments after death,' such phrases as the outer darkness, the undying worm, the Gehenna of fire--which manifestly (say these men), if judged by fair rules of interpretation, refer to this life, and specially to the fate of the Jewish nation: or when they tell us that eternal death means really eternal life, only in torments. We demand, they say, not a looser, but a stricter; not a more metaphoric, but a more literal; not a more careless, but a more reverent interpretation of Scripture; and whether this demand be right or wrong, it will not pass unheard.|$|E

30|$|Stephen Laughton and Aura Vaisbrot, {{then at the}} Royal Bank of Scotland, {{were the}} first to publish their counterargument (Laughton and Vaisbrot, 2012). Their main point was that market incompleteness does not allow one to hedge all risk factors in a {{derivatives}} portfolio as Hull and White assume. In essence, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> a funding adjustment to the risk-neutral value <b>is</b> necessary. <b>They</b> also imply that, as a consequence, pricing differs depending on the bank’s funding rate–that is, it violates the law of one price, which determines that a given asset, traded in two different markets, must have only one price in order to avoid arbitrage opportunities. Since the 2008 crisis, prices have become dealer dependent.|$|R

50|$|As for causes, Robert B. Pippin {{connects the}} 'death of the novel' {{with the rise}} of {{nihilism}} in European culture.

5000|$|Sullivan also noted: [...] "Kramer {{is not a}} radical. He's a Catholic Republican {{appointed}} by a former Republican governor." [...] Finally, Sullivan counters {{the argument that the}} decision undermines all marriage law thus: [...] No one is using any of these actual, not-always-present aspects of civil marriage to deny anyone's right to marry. No one, so far as I know, is saying that we should bar couples from civil marriages because they are not in love or not cohabiting or any other criterion. But <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> couples that do not or cannot procreate should be barred from marriage - on those grounds alone. All Kramer is saying is that current marriage laws have no such exception, and that using that exception to exclude one group of non-procreative couples (the gay ones) rather than another non-procreative group (the straight ones) makes no logical sense. Especially when many lesbian (and some gay ones) marriages have biological children, and some straight ones have adopted kids.|$|E

5000|$|In her {{negative}} {{review of}} Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Kael explained {{how she felt}} some directors who used brutal imagery in their films were desensitizing audiences to violence: At the movies, we are gradually being conditioned to accept violence as a sensual pleasure. The directors used {{to say they were}} showing us its real face and how ugly it was in order to sensitize us to its horrors. You don't have to be very keen to see that they are now in fact de-sensitizing us. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> everyone is brutal, and the heroes must be as brutal as the villains or they turn into fools. There seems to be an assumption that if you're offended by movie brutality, you are somehow playing {{into the hands of the}} people who want censorship. But this would deny those of us who don't believe in censorship the use of the only counterbalance: the freedom of the press to say that there's anything conceivably damaging in these films—the freedom to analyze their implications. If we don't use this critical freedom, we are implicitly saying that no brutality is too much for us—that only squares and people who believe in censorship are concerned with brutality.|$|E

The Serbians considered Kosovo the “Saint Land”, some kind of Jerusalem. They provided historical arguments as well: <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the territory of Kosovo province was situated in the centre of their medieval empire; on this territory were the main religious “flags”, which helped the Serbians to achieve their own cultural identity, in this region being situated their main monasteries built during the medieval period. The Serbian writer Dobrico Ćosić stated in 1999 that Kosovo province “is not only a piece of land, it represents the Serbian identity itself. With the loss of Kosovo [...] . the Serbian people was mutilated”.

5000|$|Also {{a part of}} Church {{teaching}} are {{the need}} for a special minister for the celebration of the Eucharist; and the lasting presence of Christ in the bread and the respect that should be shown to the bread. St. Ignatius of Antioch, ca. 110: [...] "Let that be considered a valid Eucharist which is celebrated by the bishop, or by one whom he appoints" [...] (Jurgens §65). From St. Cyril of Alexandria, ca. 440: [...] "I hear that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the mystical blessing does not avail unto sanctification, if some of Eucharistic species be left over to another day. They are utterly mad who say these things; for Christ is not made different, nor is His holy body changed, but the power of the blessing and the life-giving grace is uninterrupted in Him" [...] (Jurgens §2139). And Tertullian, 211: [...] "We take anxious care lest something of our Cup or Bread should fall upon the ground" [...] (Jurgens §367). Pope Innocent III, 1208: [...] "However honest, religious, holy, and prudent anyone may be, he cannot nor ought he to consecrate the Eucharist nor to perform the sacrifice of the altar unless he be a priest, regularly ordained by a visible and perceptible bishop" [...] (Dz §424). The consecrated hosts are not merely changed permanently into Eucharist, but are due the worship of latria. In early counter-Reformation times, Pope Julius III wrote in 1551: [...] "There is, therefore, no room left for doubt that all the faithful of Christ in accordance with a custom always received in the Catholic Church offer in veneration the worship of latria which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament" [...] (Dz §878).|$|E
5000|$|On 28 February 1849, 11th day of Shah Sahab swear {{punishment}} English army conquered Punjab {{and all the}} Jails of Punjab were got broken.

When he was released his family returned to Khothian. People of Khothian witnessed the presence of white marks on the palm of Shah Sahab. During the English rule the descendants of Sultan declared themselves as Jut Wadhan. Now <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> they are Malik’s and descendants of Qutab Shah which is nothing but a cruel lie. If we go through the parental record of Mr. Sultan written by his descendant Mohammad Nawaz in his book it is clear, that name of at least 10 persons above Sultan are Hindu’s name. Which is obscure that how a Muslim person can have Hindu name in the period of Muslim Regime? For example, one of these 10 persons was named Khothi, which clearly shows that it is a non- Muslim name. Over time, the village became associated with the Sahgal family, and was renamed as Saigolabad. The Sahgal family financed the construction of a school and hostel in Saigolabad in the 1950s. This is known as Saigolabad Model High School. Now it has the status of [...] "Union Council Khothian" [...] and 12 other small villages (Rabal, Sarkal, Budhial, Chabri, Chabar, Chak Jharhy, Punjain, Mohrha Gujran, kehwal, Dhok Mian Mehr and Chak Kharak) are associated with it. The current chairman of UC Saigalabad is [...] "Ch Saeed Azad".Indeed, it is lack of knowledge, this person Shoaib Khalid Subhani is by cast barber and he amended the history intentionally even do not know the ABC of history of town Khothian. In fact this piece of land is the property of landlord Raib Khan the great who gifted this to legend Muhammad Sultan Khothi who was already Muslim and migrated from famous village of Khothian(Jalip) Jehlum in reward to protect Raib Khan from Sikh invaders and looters while Syed Haji Shah sahib(RA) was also residing there.|$|E
5000|$|Tuesday, January 2, 1917. [...] "Rasputin's corpse was {{discovered}} {{yesterday in the}} ice of the little Nevka, alongside Krestovsky Island and near the Belosselsky palace.Up to the last moment the Empress has been hoping that [...] "God would spare her her comforter and only friend."The police are not allowing any details of the drama to be published. Besides, the Okhrana is pursuing its enquiries in such secrecy that even this morning Trepov; the President of the Council, replied to the impatient questions of the Grand Duke Nicholas Michailovitch:"Monseigneur, I swear to you that I have nothing whatever {{to do with what}} is going on, and know nothing of the enquiry."There was great rejoicing among the public when it heard of the death of Rasputin the day before yesterday. People kissed each other in the streets and many went to burn candles in Our Lady of Kazan.When it was known that the Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich was one of the assassins there was a crush to light candles before the ikons of Saint Dimitri.The murder of Grigori is the sole topic of conversation among the unending queues of women who wait in the snow and wind at the doors of the butchers and grocers to secure their share of meat, tea, sugar, etc. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Rasputin was thrown into the Nevka alive, and approvingly quoting the proverb: Sabâkyé, sabâtchya smerte! [...] "A dog's death for a dog!" [...] They are also whispering that the Grand Duchess Tatiana, the Emperor's second daughter, witnessed the drama disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her. And carrying the vindictive ferocity of the moujik into the world of the Court, they add that to satiate her thirst for vengeance the dying Grigori was castrated before her eyes.Another popular story is this: [...] "Rasputin was still breathing when he was thrown under the ice of the Malaya Nevka. It is very important, for if so he will never become a saint." [...] It is a fact that the Russian masses believe that the drowned can never be canonized." ...|$|E

"States' rights" [...] had {{for decades}} been a {{rallying}} slogan for racial segregationists, including Strom Thurmond in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968, and several press writers interpreted Reagan's {{use of the}} phrase according to that tradition. Columnist Bob Herbert of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Everybody watching the 1980 campaign knew what Reagan was signaling at the fair," [...] and that it [...] "was understood that when politicians started chirping about 'states’ rights' to white people in places like Neshoba County <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{when it comes down}} to you and the blacks, we’re with you".
