5000|$|The {{earliest}} experimental autopilot-controlled landings {{in commercial}} service {{were not in}} fact full auto landings but were termed [...] "auto-flare". In this mode the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the autopilot controlled the [...] "flare" [...] or pitch. These were often done in passenger service {{as part of the}} development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke <b>thumb-button,</b> it was also possible to disengage the roll channel while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the <b>thumb-button,</b> called for the second officer to latch off the roll channel only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the autopilot's continued control of the vertical flight path - ready to completely disengage it {{at the first sign of}} any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during on-line training or qualification.|$|E
40|$|An ultra-reliable flashlight, {{initially}} {{developed for}} rescue signaling and utility use by NASA astronauts and military aircrews, {{has attracted a}} broad commercial market. Called the Five Year Light, it has a shelf life at least that long {{because there is no}} power drain on the batteries when the flashlight is not in use. The NASA version of the light was developed under contract with Langley Research Center by ACR Electronics, Inc., now known as the Chromalloy Electronics Division of Chromalloy American Corporation, Hollywood, Florida. NASA wanted a light that had long shelf life and assured reliability in case it was needed in an emergency. Reliability was designed into the flashlight by means of a unique switch. Instead of the customary <b>thumb-button,</b> the Five Year Light is turned on by rotating its collar to make contact with the battery terminal; the turning motion wipes away any corrosion that might be present and makes contact virtually certain. The Five Year Light available commercially is a repackaged version of the NASA light. It is sold for car, home, industrial, police, firefighting, recreational {{and a variety of other}} uses, and sales have topped two million units...|$|E
30|$|Proprioception was {{evaluated}} using the kinaesthetic test TDPM (Reider et al., 2003) on a Biodex-type isokinetic equipment (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Both knees were evaluated one after another, {{starting with the}} uninjured knee to reassure athletes. Athletes were seated with 5 [*]cm between the popliteal fossa and the seat to prevent contact with the underlying surface. Athletes wore shorts to minimize material rubbing against their skin. The thigh was strapped and the leg {{was connected to the}} mobile arm of the Biodex using a pneumatic cuff {{at the level of the}} ankle. The centre of rotation was placed at the level of the lateral condyle of the knee. For each participant, the anatomic zero point was considered to be the extension position. Athletes were blind-folded and listened to music loud enough to cover any sounds from equipment sound, using headphones, because white noise was impossible with the other patients. The same music was used for all persons. Athletes used a press-button to stop the equipment with a single press of the thumb. Before initiating the TDPM test, a full explanation was given to each patient. Each athlete performed two practice tests (listening to music and blind-folded) to become familiar with the procedure. The starting position of each measurement was a 15 ° knee flexion (Pitman et al., 1992). After an unspecified period of time, the limb was moved into flexion with a 4 °/sec angular velocity. Athletes were asked to use the <b>thumb-button</b> as soon as they detected a knee movement. Pressure on the button instantaneously stopped the movement. The range of motion between the initiation of the movement and the stopping of the machine was recorded in degrees. The examiner then returned the device to the initial position, replacing the leg at 15 ° flexion, by an extension movement to 0 ° then a flexion of the knee to 15 ° which was calculated by a program in the Biodex. At the starting position, the athlete was informed that the next test would begin. The entire TDPM procedure included 10 tests for both limbs. The range of motion between the start position and the perception of movement were averaged for each knee. In first, we checked the reproducibility of this TDPM procedure on an isokinetic Biodex-style machine. In this context, we performed two measures on a healthy control population at a 1 day interval. The study was approved by the Ethics Biomedical Commission of the Academic Hospital of the UCL of Louvain-la-Neuve (Number: B 403 2012 14, 124). All participants provided written informed consent.|$|E
