Thus, {{a resident}} of one country cannot avoid being treated as having a PE by acting through a dependent agent rather than conducting its business directly.

40|$|Assessing {{potential}} uptake of agri-environmental schemes {{based on}} farm and farmer characteristics only {{results in an}} incomplete analysis because it neglects the effects of motivational issues of the institutional design of contracts, as {{set up by the}} government, and of social capital. In this paper we describe contract choice using a trivariate probit model and taking into account farm and farmer characteristics and motivational issues. Motivational issues in this study include the perception of institutional design, the use of extension services, trust in the government, and preferences for stable policies. Results show that besides farm and farmer characteristics these factors are important for the likelihood of enrolling in agri-environmental contracts. They do not influence every contract type in the same way and further decisions to conclude different contract types are connected. If farmers perceive the design of an agri-environmental scheme as weak or favour a stable policy they are less likely <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> for biodiversity protection. Farmers who do not trust the government are less likely <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> for less intensive practices. Involvement in general networks increases the probability of contracting for wildlife and landscape management and less intensive practices whereas this factor is not important for biodiversity protection. The results suggest that taking into account motivational issues and differentiating towards different contract types can increase effectiveness and efficiency of agri-environmental schemes...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{activities}} {{require the}} existence of rules and their enforcement as preconditions that the market cannot generate itself. Property rights, contractual rights and obligations are minimal conditions that in modern societies are provided and enforced by the state. Without such rules, the market cannot flourish. The state thus determines regulations and delineates the sphere of private freedom, within which individual citizens and private institutions are entitled <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> amongst each other but are as well forced {{to abide by the}} contracted rules. In line of the development of modern nation states, the state has not only been the guarantor of civil rights, e. g. the right to own property, to enter into private contracts, and to engage in market activity. In its role as a democratic constitutional state it has also been the guarantor of political participation rights, the right of the citizen {{to take part in the}} processes to determine public rules and issues of public concern. Finally, in its role as a welfare state it has provided social rights for citizens, such as the right to education, to healthcare and welfare (Marshall, 1965). The combination of state-guaranteed civil, political, and social rights provided modern society with welfare, legitimacy and solidarity, thereby contributing to peacefully stabilize the community of anonymous individuals (Habermas, 2001).

Recent examples of IOT products include Amazon’s Dash Replenishment Service, which allows household devices to automatically reorder goods. By 2025, the IOT is estimated to have an economic impact of as much as $ 11. 1 trillion. To date, there are approximately fifteen billion interconnected devices, and by 2020, there will be fifty billion such devices worldwide. IOT devices will revolutionize the way that consumers shop for consumable supplies and other goods. Consumers will no longer need to log on to a company’s website or use a mobile application to purchase goods but will be able <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> for the sale of goods by using IOT devices. This Article contends that the legion of IOT data expected to be generated about consumers and their preferences will worsen preexisting information asymmetry in consumer contracts to the benefit of companies; increase the lack of proximity between consumers and the contract formation process; further encourage consumers’ failure to read and understand contract terms prior to contracting; and likely lead businesses to further take advantage of consumer ignorance and apathy by including one-sided contract terms, such as unilateral amendment provisions and terms that restrict consumer access to judicial process. Common law agency principles, e-commerce statutes, contract law, and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“Article 2 ”) are unlikely to effectively address these concerns. This Article suggests important amendments to Article 2 and argues that courts should adjust their application of existing contract law and agency principles to account for the new automatic and interface-free contracting environment that the age of the IOT will herald...|$|E
40|$|Business profits {{constitute}} {{the main part}} of income derived through international business and these profits are only to be taxed in the home state of the enterprise. However, if the enterprise conducts business in a host state through a PE, the profits attributable to the PE are taxable in the host state. Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax determines the profits attributable to the PE. Nevertheless, Member States have interpreted Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention in various ways. In order to provide consensus the OECD adopted an authorised OECD approach for attributing profits to PEs. The first part of the purpose of this thesis is to study the Swedish approach for attributing profits to dependent agent PEs in relation to the authorised OECD approach. An enterprise from the home state can be considered to have a dependent agent PE in the host state if it conducts business in the host state through a dependent agent located therein. This is provided that the agent has the authority <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> {{in the name of the}} enterprise and exercises this authority regularly. Under the authorised OECD approach for profit attribution to dependent agent PEs it is possible to allocate profits to the PE in excess of the arm’s length remuneration paid to the dependent agent. Thereby, the OECD has adopted the dual taxpayer approach as the authorised OECD approach. According to the author’s opinion the Swedish perspective regarding profit attribution to dependent agent PEs differs from the authorised OECD approach as the dual taxpayer approach so far has not been applied in Sweden. Furthermore, it differs as the attribution of capital to PEs is not allowed according to case law and as far as the recognition of internal dealings is concerned. When the OECD adopted the dual taxpayer approach as the authorised OECD approach another method was available; the single taxpayer approach. In line with this approach no further profits in excess of the arm’s length remuneration to the dependent agent can be attributed to the dependent agent PE. However, the single taxpayer approach was rejected as the authorised OECD approach, which has lead to disagreement within the international tax community. Therefore, the second part of the purpose of this thesis is to study to what extent the authorised OECD approach is sustained. This is done by analysing reactions to the single and dual taxpayer approach among business and academic circles. The author believes that reactions against the dual taxpayer approach mainly arise in situations when an enterprise in the host state gives rise to a dependent agent PE. Therefore, the authorised OECD approach should have recognised that different types of dependent agent PEs might arise and the approach is only sustained to the extent that a person belonging to the foreign enterprise leads to the existence of a dependent agent PE...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Import and Export Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Since the Internet became {{available}} for commercial {{use in the}} early 90 s, the {{way of doing business}} was changed forever. The Internet and electronic commerce have allowed people to carry out business by means of electronic communications, which makes it possible for them to do business and <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> with people situated within foreign jurisdictions. The need for consumer protection in electronic commerce has become necessary because of the misuse of aspects peculiar to electronic–commerce. Consumers have been cautious to make use of electroniccommerce, as they are uncertain about the consequences that their actions might have. Consumers will only utilise e–commerce if they have confidence in the legal system regulating it; therefore, legislation was needed to regulate their e–commerce activities. In 2002, the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002 was introduced into South African law as the first piece of legislation that would deal exclusively with electronic communications. Chapter VII of this particular act deals exclusively with consumer protection and seeks to remove certain uncertainties imposed by e–commerce. This is done by providing the South African consumer with statutory rights and obligations when engaging in electronic communications. The Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008 is the most recent piece of legislation that aims to promote a consistent legislative and enforcement framework relating to consumer transactions and agreements. South African legislation dealing with electronic commerce is relatively recent, and it is uncertain whether consumers are offered sufficient protection when they conclude contracts with suppliers or sellers from a foreign jurisdiction, that is, one that is situated outside South Africa. After looking at the protection mechanisms in place for South African consumers engaging in e–commerce, we have seen that there are certain problems that one might experience when trying to determine the applicability of some of the consumer protection measures to international electronic contracts. Most of the problems that we have identified are practical of nature. Consumers may, for instance, find it hard to execute their rights against foreign suppliers in a South African court, even if the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. Another problem that we identified {{is that some of the}} important terms in our legislation are too vaguely defined. Vague terms and definitions can lead to legal uncertainty, as consumers might find it hard to understand the ambit of the acts, and to determine the applicability thereof on their transactions. In order to look for possible solutions for South Africa, the author referred to the legal position with regards to consumer protections in the United Kingdom, and saw the important role that European Union legislation plays when determining the legal position regarding consumer protection in the UK. The legislation in the UK dealing with consumer protection is far more specific than the South African legislation dealing with same. There is definitely consumer protection legislation in place in South Africa but the ongoing technological changes in the electronic commerce milieu make it necessary for our legislators to review consumer protection legislation on a regular basis to ensure that it offers sufficient protection for South African consumers engaging in international electronic contracts.

40|$|This Thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interpretation}} of the ’directed activities’ connecting factor in the context of cross-border electronic commerce in tangible goods. The connecting factor is used as a condition for applying the private interna-tional law consumer protection rules of Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 (the Brussels Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 593 / 2008 (the Rome I Regulation). The two-part connecting factor gives that a consumer contract is eligible for protection only if two cumulative conditions are met. Firstly, the business must have directed its activities to consumer’s jurisdiction or several jurisdictions including that. Secondly, the contract must falls within the scope of such activities. Before addressing the main purpose, it is reviewed what kind of consumer protection these Regulations offer. In addition, the significance of these rules is observed {{in the light of the}} recent developments in fields of procedural and substantial EU consumer law. The perspective of this study is European. The connecting factor is a product of the Europeanized private international law and it is specifically designed to provide protection for consumer engaging in e-commerce. In order to facilitate consumer trust in e-commerce, the circumstances in which consumers can resort to the protective rules should be clearly defined. However, the practical application of the connecting factor has been ambiguous. The main purpose of this study is to identify those legal facts which are relevant when determining if the requirements set down in the connecting factor are satisfied. In addition, the aim is to clarify how much evidential value these facts can bear in practical situations. The analysis is illustrated with examples of situations in which a consumer can, could or cannot enjoy the protection. The methodological focus is on analyzing the relevant case law of the ECJ. The interpretation established in the case law is complemented by analyzing the preparatory works for the relevant community instruments and Advocate Generals’ Opinions. In addition, visions created in academic debate are reviewed in order to see if they are in line with the autonomous interpretation. This study is mainly concerned with consumers’ interests and claims that consumers should be able to foresee their legal position before concluding a contract. In addition, the study acknowledges that consumers’ interests must be balanced against professionals’ interests. The main finding of this study is that, despite the recent case law and academic debate, the practical application of the connecting factor relies on case-by-case evaluation. Thus it is challenging to create clear guidelines for its application. Firstly, when considering if a website accessible in consumer’s jurisdiction constitutes an activity directed to that country, the evaluation should take into account website features and the professional’s overall activity. Consumers can enjoy the protection only if it is apparent that the professional was minded <b>to</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>contracts</b> with customers from consumer’s jurisdiction. Secondly, when determining whether the contract falls within the scope of the directed activities, the evaluation is based on the circumstances which led to the conclusion of the contract and in which the contract is concluded. It is discovered that, if the contract is concluded through the website, it generally falls within the scope of protection. However, if the contract is concluded by other means, there must be evidence indicating that there is a link between the directed activity and the contract. The general finding is that this fact-specific case-by-case evaluation will continue to cause uncertainty for consumers and professionals engaging in cross-border e-commerce...|$|E
