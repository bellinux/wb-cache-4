5|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited {{directly from}} the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers {{than at any other time}} before or since.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} closer to the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini {{was taken to a}} command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
25|$|While Google {{is often}} {{thought of as the}} {{invention}} of two young computer whizzes—Sergey and Larry, Larry and Sergey—the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.|$|E

25|$|Later {{on in the}} 1930s, Curry began wrestling in Detroit under {{promoter}} Adam Weissmuller (uncle of Johnny Weissmuller) {{who also}} trained him for his professional career. Curry stayed in Detroit for several years developing his brutal, hardcore style of wrestling {{that made him a}} top name in the territory. Curry was so well known that he even faced legendary heavyweight pro boxer Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match in 1940. Years later Curry would often claim that he knocked Dempsey out in the match but the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Curry was stopped in the second round.|$|E
25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well this is a new constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
25|$|Other sources {{claim that}} an angry mob {{tried to kill}} Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. Heracleides of Pontus asserts that the {{audience}} tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.|$|E
60|$|Alma {{accepted}} {{the situation with}} an apathy that amazed Anna. The <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Alma <b>was</b> stunned by a thought {{that had come to}} her even while Anna was speaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fine. And you'll {{be going}} soon? Don't {{take that as}} if I wanted to--" [...] Belding paused, for the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he did want to hurry them off.|$|R
60|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Hereward's heart <b>was</b> gnawed {{with shame}} and remorse; and {{therefore}} he fancied, and not without reason, {{that all men}} pointed at him the finger of scorn.|$|R
25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E
25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, but the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> on {{the morning}} of this eventful day, Mr. Alexander Fairford had {{received}} from his correspondent and friend, Provost Crosbie of Dumfries, a letter of the following tenor: ...|$|R
5000|$|Leibniz {{identified}} {{two kinds of}} truth, necessary and contingent truths. He believed necessary mathematical <b>truths</b> to <b>be</b> derived from the law of identity (and the principle of contradiction): [...] "Necessary <b>truths</b> <b>are</b> those <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> demonstrated through an analysis of terms, {{so that in the}} end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values variables. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> necessary <b>truths</b> depend upon the principle of contradiction." [...] Leibniz states that the sufficient reason for necessary <b>truths</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> their negation <b>is</b> a contradiction.|$|R
60|$|Abruptly Kurt {{left them}} and hurried {{out of the}} house. How strange that {{difficult}} feelings had arisen--emotions he had never considered at all! But the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> leaving his home forever. All <b>was</b> explained in <b>that.</b>|$|R
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b> let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They wish he had died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son {{to pay tribute to}} her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only the thought of her child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but she thinks it wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says {{it will be difficult to}} get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E
60|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sir Agravaine the Dolorous {{was out of}} {{his element}} at King Arthur's court, and he knew it. It <b>was</b> this {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> had given him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his title.|$|R
60|$|And now {{it must be}} told why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sir Palamydes came to be in such a sorry case as that; for the <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{locked and}} shut outside of the tower, whilst the Lady Belle Isoult was shut and locked inside thereof.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, he {{may as well}} remain {{where he}} is," [...] replied Mr Sudberry, whose {{imperfect}} hearing led him to suppose that his spouse had said, [...] "Jacky's inside, my dear!" [...] whereas the real <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the boy <b>was</b> neither out nor inside.|$|R

500|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in {{this book}} a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an {{understanding}} of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology...

500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel....

50|$|The Four Lances who {{apparently}} betrayed the Empire to Wisstech. The <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> {{the ones who}} actually completed the quest while the Seven 'Heroes' ambushed and murdered them, and afterwards stole credit for their accomplishments. After Glenn betrays the Empire, however, the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> revealed and the Four Lances are exonerated and given the recognition they deserve.|$|R
60|$|The <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Rollo’s father <b>was</b> {{accustomed}} to come every spring, and purchase his garden seeds at this farm; and so, {{after a few}} minutes, {{they went into the}} house, taking Rollo with them, to get the seeds <b>that</b> <b>were</b> wanted, out of the seed-room.|$|R
500|$|Further, the CBO {{reported}} in January 2017 that it expected {{enrollment in the}} exchanges to rise from 10 million during 2017 to 13 million by 2027, assuming laws {{in place at the}} end of the Obama administration were continued. Following a 2015 CBO report that reached a similar conclusion, Paul Krugman wrote: [...] "But the <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this report is much, much closer to what supporters of reform have said than it is to the scare stories of the critics--no death spirals, no job-killing, major gains in coverage at relatively low cost." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after [...] "Querido FBI" [...] gained notoriety for Calle 13, the band's 2005 eponymously titled {{debut album}} was {{released}} and became commercially and critically successful in Latin America. [...] The group was subsequently labeled as reggaeton, a genre that the duo wished to distance itself from. [...] Visitante {{commented on the}} situation: [...] "The <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the first record had only four reggaetons. Those were the cuts used for promotional purposes, and so that’s the brand that was put on us. But from the beginning, to me, reggaeton never offered anything musically. My brother liked it, yes, but we always tried to execute it in an organic way, with real instruments and mixing it with other genres." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{chaplain}} laughed. [...] "You, sir," [...] he said, [...] "are close enough!"
