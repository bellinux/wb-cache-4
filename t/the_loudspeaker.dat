5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn to develop <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> {{system of the}} 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT). Arriving in the marketplace in 1945, it offered better coherence and clarity at high power levels. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the movie theater industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency signal from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which is sent to <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
25|$|Maximum sound {{pressure}} level– The highest output <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> can manage, short of damage or not exceeding a particular distortion level. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material—commonly {{without reference to}} frequency range or distortion level.|$|E

25|$|Size of {{individual}} drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside {{diameter of the}} basket. However, it may less commonly also be {{the diameter of the}} cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one mounting hole to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.|$|E
25|$|Since {{panels of}} {{infinite}} dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear {{radiation from the}} moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted {{from the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, visco-elastic materials (e.g., mineral-loaded bitumen) or thin lead sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} are {{the oldest}} form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying megaphones dates {{at least to}} the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition {{at the mouth of the}} horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{re-recording}} {{has been used}} {{throughout the history of}} recording studios. Pierre Schaeffer in the 1930s and 1940s used recorded sounds, such as trains, and played them back with ambient alteration, re-recording the net result. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Edgard Varèse later used similar techniques. Les Paul and Mary Ford recorded layered vocal harmonies and guitar parts, modifying prior tracks with effects such as ambient reverb while recording the net result together on a new track. Les Paul placed a loudspeaker at one end of a tunnel and a microphone at the other end. <b>The</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> played back previously recorded material - the microphone recorded the resulting altered sound.|$|E
25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.|$|E
25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E
50|$|In audio {{reinforcement}} {{for music}} or speech presentation in large venues, it is optimal to deliver sufficient sound volume {{to the back}} of the venue without resorting to excessive sound volumes near the front. One way for audio engineers to achieve this is to use additional loudspeakers placed at a distance from the stage but closer to the rear of the audience. Sound travels through air at the speed of sound (around 343 m per second depending on air temperature and humidity). By measuring or estimating the difference in latency between <b>the</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> near <b>the</b> stage and <b>the</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> nearer <b>the</b> audience, the audio engineer can introduce an appropriate delay in the audio signal going to <b>the</b> latter <b>loudspeakers,</b> so that <b>the</b> wavefronts from near and far <b>loudspeakers</b> arrive at <b>the</b> same time. Because of the Haas effect an additional 15 milliseconds can be added to the delay time of <b>the</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> nearer <b>the</b> audience, so that the stage's wavefront reaches them first, to focus the audience's attention on the stage rather than <b>the</b> local <b>loudspeaker.</b> <b>The</b> slightly later sound from delayed <b>loudspeakers</b> simply increases <b>the</b> perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization.|$|R

The last one resembled the first setting but <b>the</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> were put inside a small partial enclosure whose opening was facing vertically upward. Results show that the last setting can produce a sound field with characteristics close to those of a two-dimensional sound field.

25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Behind the ear aids (BTE) {{consist of}} a case, an earmold or dome and a {{connection}} between them. The case contains the electronics, controls, battery, microphone(s) and often <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> Generally, the case sits behind the pinna with the connection from the case coming down the front into the ear. The sound from the instrument can be routed acoustically or electrically to the ear. If the sound is routed electrically, the speaker (receiver) {{is located in the}} earmold or an open-fit dome, while acoustically coupled instruments use a plastic tube to deliver the sound from the case’s loudspeaker to the earmold. BTEs are also easily connected to assistive listening devices, such as FM systems, to directly integrate sound sources with the instrument. BTE aids are commonly worn by children who need a durable type of hearing aid.|$|E
25|$|Various {{manufacturers}} {{use different}} driver mounting arrangements {{to create a}} specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called monitors, as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later Bose models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in high fidelity circles, but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{determined}} {{that half of the}} lifeboats, those on the port side, were unlaunchable due to the severe list, which left them high in the air. To make matters worse, the list also complicated normal lifeboat procedures on the starboard side. Instead of loading lifeboats {{at the side of the}} Promenade Deck and then lowering them into the water, it would be necessary to lower the boats empty, and somehow get evacuees down the exterior of the ship to water level to board. This was eventually accomplished through ropes and Jacob's ladders. In fear of causing a panic and stampeding of the starboard lifeboats, Captain Calamai decided against giving the order to abandon ship until help arrived. In the meantime, Second Officer Badano made announcements over <b>the</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> system instructing passengers to put on their lifebelts and go to their designated muster stations.|$|E
