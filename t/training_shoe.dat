40|$|Purpose. The {{literature}} shows {{few studies}} on shod and unshod running performance in athletes, with most limited to laboratory settings. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate preadolescent 1000 m running performance when barefoot and in running spikes or <b>training</b> <b>shoes.</b> Methods. A sample of 22 boys and 21 girls aged 10. 6 ± 1. 1 years was recruited. Anthropometric data and VO 2 max were recorded when completing the three study protocols in a counter balanced design. Student’s t tests were applied to compare mean 1000 m finish times while ANOVA was used to evaluate sex differences between the protocols. Pearson's correlation analysis measured interactions between the finish times, anthropometric variables, and VO 2 max. Results. Running performance with spikes (4. 58 min) was significantly better than with <b>training</b> <b>shoes</b> (5. 21 min) and barefoot (5. 18 min). Male 1000 m times were overall better than the females. A substantial effect of VO 2 max and body fat on performance was found in all protocols. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{difference}} in plantar loading between two different running shoe types. We hypothesized that a higher maximum force, peak pressure, and contact area would exist beneath the entire foot while running in a racing flat when compared to a <b>training</b> <b>shoe.</b> 37 athletes (17 male and 20 female) were recruited for this study. Subjects had no history of lower extremity injuries in the past six months, no history of foot or ankle surgery within the past 3 years, and no history of metatarsal stress fractures. Subjects had to be physically active and run at least 10 miles per week. Each subject ran on a 10 m runway 7 times wearing two different running shoe types, the Nike Air Pegasus (<b>training</b> <b>shoe)</b> and the Nike Air Zoom Katana IV (racing flat). A Pedar-X in-shoe pressure measurement system sampling at 50 Hz was used to collect plantar pressure data. Peak pressure, maximum force, and contact area beneath eight different anatomical regions of the foot as well as beneath the total foot were obtained. The results of this study demonstrated a significant difference between training shoes and racing flats in terms of peak pressure, maximum force, and contact area. The significant differences measured between the two shoes can be of importance when examining the influence of shoe type on the occurrence of stress fractures in runners. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Despite the {{differences}} in materials, racing flats have begun to be used not only for racing, but also for daily training. As there are data suggesting a gender difference in overuse injuries in runners, shoe choice may affect loading patterns during running. The purpose was to determine differences in plantar pressure between genders when running in training shoes and racing flats. In-shoe plantar pressure {{data were collected from}} 34 subjects (17 m, 17 f) who ran over-ground in both a racing flat and <b>training</b> <b>shoe.</b> Contact area (CA), maximum force (MF), and contact time under the entire foot and beneath eight foot regions were collected. Each variable was analyzed using a shoe by gender repeated measures ANOVA (alpha= 0. 05). In men, MF was increased in the racing flats (p= 0. 016) beneath the medial midfoot (MMF), yet was increased beneath the medial forefoot (MFF) in the <b>training</b> <b>shoe</b> (p= 0. 018). Independent of gender, CA was decreased in the racing flats beneath the entire foot (p= 0. 029), the MMF (p= 0. 013), and the MFF (p= 0. 030), and increased beneath the lateral forefoot (LFF) (p= 0. 023). In the racing flats, MF was increased beneath the entire foot (p < 0. 001) and the LFF (p < 0. 001). Independent of the shoe, CA was decreased in men beneath the MFF (p= 0. 007) and middle forefoot (p < 0. 001), while MF was increased in the LFF (p= 0. 002). The LFF is an area of increased stress fracture risk in men. Based on the gender differences in loading, running shoe design should be gender specific in an attempt to prevent injurie...|$|E

Several {{studies have}} been proposed {{but in most cases}} lack of electrical and mechanical parts integration and practical application purpose. Here, with the aim of supply a Bluetooth step-counter placed in the sole of a <b>training</b> <b>shoe,</b> a complete system is presented. It consists of a magnetoinductive transducer embedded with an electronic interface for power conditioning and exploits only the energy recovered by the impact on the ground. A 27 × 16 mm cylindrical device containing the transducer, the electronic interface, the step-counter electronics and the protective shell is developed. Energy recovery derives from the magnet free oscillation following the shoe impact. The proposed interface exploits pulse width modulation to perform transducer output rectification and to emulate optimal load impedance while charging a storage capacitor. Numerical and experimental analysis show effective optimal resistive load emulation and energy recovery gain of 2 compared to the standard AC-DC interface. Prototypes has been manufactured and tested. Considering a sample foot-step, energy recovery is 360 μJ against 400 μJ dissipated on optimal resistor. Mean energy recovery over a complete run is 644 μJ/foot-step.

40|$|Advisor: David S. SenchinaBACKGROUND: Training {{shoes are}} {{designed}} differently for different purposes. Many {{people believe that}} expensive shoes mean better performance. Manufacturing companies modify shoes to fit consumer demands in style as opposed to performance. This has made the prices of shoes unreasonably high. PURPOSE: To determine whether a <b>training</b> <b>shoe</b> price determines its performance. HYPOTHESIS: adidas_ 1 DLX (most expensive of the models tested) {{is the best in}} terms of comfort level and stability as compared to two other shoes. METHODS: Seven male subjects ranging between the ages of 19 to 31 were recruited to run on a treadmill wearing three shoes adidas_ 1 DLX, Nike Sparq, and Under Armour Illusion. They ran for four minutes each at their own pace, after which they were asked to rate each shoe based on perceived comfort and stability. Heart rate was measured after each treadmill run. RESULTS: adidas_ 1 DLX had a lower comfort rating than other shoe models. Ratings of stability and heart rate did not differ significantly between models. CONCLUSIONS: adidas_ 1 DLX was the least comfortable and stable despite its high price, possibly because of the computer and motor in the sole. Under Armour Illusion, on the other hand, was the most comfortable and stable shoe though it was cheaper. Price did not predict performance in these training shoes.

It {{is a movement}} that combines agility, strength and explosive movements as the person hops diagonally from point to point. The <b>training</b> <b>shoes</b> being worn by the participant can have {{a huge impact on}} performance and accuracy (the ability to hit each point). Purpose: This study examines comfort and stability of <b>training</b> <b>shoes</b> and their respective roles in performance. Information gained from this study could help provide direction in selecting appropriate <b>training</b> <b>shoes</b> for <b>training</b> programs, specifically those involving lateral and diagonal movements. Hypothesis: We have hypothesized that shoes with a higher comfort and stability as rated by the participants will lead to greater accuracy in the shuttle run exercise. Methods: Subjects performed the shuttle run in each of 3 shoe models. Their performance was based on their accuracy for hitting predetermined target points on the floor. Following the trial, subjects then rated each shoe for comfort and stability. Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) was run on the data collected to test for significance of shoe comfort, stability, heart rate, total misses, heel contacts, total on target, and rate of perceived exertion. Results: Shoe model comfort and stability had no significant effect on any parameter. Conclusions: There {{was no significant difference between}} shoes. We therefore had to reject our original hypothesis that increased comfort and stability of a shoe would lead to increased accuracy and performance during shuttle run.

40|$|The robust {{design of}} the mass-produced British {{football}} boot from {{the late nineteenth century}} onwards appeared to evolve rather slowly compared with subsequent lightweight, flexible ‘continental’ fabrication. However, with careful reading we can identify considerable overlap and influence between manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Boot and shoe manufacturing was an intensely competitive industry and it was in the interests of entrepreneurs to pioneer advances in order to promote a particular brand. In developing football boots for the mass market this may have included much pseudo-science but even small innovations sought to improve performance and market share. Design ambiguities were also inherent because footwear manufacturers routinely borrowed and appropriated successful design elements for their own products. With more choice and consumer demand, football boots became increasingly less adapted from other outdoor footwear owned by the participant, to specialised models manufactured as part of the flourishing sporting goods industry. The internationalisation of the mass market for football boots is here explored though the distinct but related case studies of two family firms; Manfield from Northamptonshire, England and Adidas from Herzogenaurach, Germany. Arguing that there was much continuity between the designs and manufacturing processes of the two firms, the article explores how the {{design of the}} football boot became increasingly influenced by the fashion industry as items of conspicuous consumption. By 1954 the launch of the <b>training</b> <b>shoe</b> saw sportswear become a style trend worn on the street, rather than on the pitch. This in turn, influenced football boot design as both a highly technical item of elite sportswear and an expensive, aspirational essential in an everyday kitbag...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{developing}} infinite-life autonomous wireless electronics, {{powered by the}} energy of the surrounding environment, drives the research efforts in the field of Energy Harvesting. Electromagnetic and piezoelectric techniques are deemed to be the most attractive technologies for vibrational devices. In the thesis, both these technologies are investigated taking into account the entire energy conversion chain. In the context of the collaboration with the STMicroelectronics, the project of a self-powered Bluetooth step counter embedded in a <b>training</b> <b>shoe</b> has been carried out. A cylindrical device 27 × 16 mm including the transducer, the interface circuit, the step-counter electronics and the protective shell, has been developed. Environmental energy extraction occurs exploiting the vibration of a permanent magnet in response to the impact of the shoe on the ground. A self-powered electrical interface performs maximum power transfer through optimal resistive load emulation and load decoupling. The device provides 360 μJ to the load, the 90 % of the maximum recoverable energy. The energy requirement is four time less than the provided and the effectiveness of the proposed device is demonstrated also considering the foot-steps variability and the performance spread due to prototypes manufacturing. In the context of the collaboration with the G 2 Elab of Grenoble and STMicroelectronics, the project of a piezoelectric energy arvester has been carried out. With the aim of exploiting environmental vibrations, an uni-morph piezoelectric cantilever beam 60 × 25 × 0. 5 mm with a proof mass at the free-end has been designed. Numerical results show that electrical interfaces based on SECE and sSSHI techniques allows increasing performance up to the 125 % and the 115 % of that in case of STD interface. Due to the better performance in terms of harvested power and in terms of electric load decoupling, a self-powered SECE interface has been prototyped. In response to 2 m/s 2 56, 2 Hz sinusoidal input, experimental power recovery of 0. 56 mW is achieved demonstrating that the device is compliant with standard low-power electronics requirements...|$|E
