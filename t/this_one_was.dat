5|$|Richard {{clashed with}} Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York, over the {{respective}} {{rights of the}} two sees throughout his time as archbishop. In 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their supporters. King Henry II managed to secure a truce for five years between the two archbishops but Richard was soon embroiled in another dispute. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> with Roger, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury and revolved around {{whether or not the}} abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had jurisdictional rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement that left the abbey dependent on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of Thanet, which had previously been held by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> performed straight and level, not in an outside loop {{to assist in the}} separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading to the destruction of both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E

It offers a demonstration of Kismet's capabilities, narrated as emotive facial expressions that communicate the robot's 'motivational state', Dr. Brazeal: [...] "This <b>one</b> <b>is</b> anger (laugh) extreme anger, disgust, excitement, fear, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> happiness, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> interest, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> sadness, surprise, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> tired, and <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> sleep." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic pumice deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
5|$|When {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1919, Surrey awarded Hobbs {{a five-year}} contract worth £400 a year. During the season, he began to open the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership. In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket. Like Hobbs' other successful partnerships, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> based on quick running. Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs' duck. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, the Tar Heels had a {{first down}} at their 32-yard line. Linton was stopped for no gain on a rushing play, passed for no gain, then {{completed}} a nine-yard pass to Brown. Failing to gain the first down, the Tar Heels punted and the ball was returned to the 30-yard line. Oxendine gained two yards on a rush up the right side, then Sorensen ran for one yard {{on the left side}} of the field. On third down, Sorensen scrambled for {{a first down}} before fumbling the football. The loose ball was picked up by Tech lineman Derek Smith, and the Hokies' drive continued. After a rush for no gain, another running play resulted in a Tech fumble, their second of the drive. Unlike the previous fumble, however, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> recovered by North Carolina's Russell Davis, and the Tar Heels offense was put into position for another scoring attempt.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed {{to be on the verge}} of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E
