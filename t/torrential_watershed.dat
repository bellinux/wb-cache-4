40|$|In this paper, debris-flow {{modeling}} {{is shown}} {{specifically on the}} basis of a potential debris flow from the Hrenovec <b>torrential</b> <b>watershed</b> above the village of Kropa in NW Slovenia. This site was chosen, because in this particular <b>torrential</b> <b>watershed</b> a small surficial landslide turned into a debris flow during a storm on September 18, 2007. Fortunately, the debris flow stopped inside the torrential channel above the village of Kropa. Using public available data on rainfall and topography, we developed two scenarios of debris-flow triggering with an estimated magnitude of 50, 000 m(3). According the first scenario, a debris flow triggers during rainfall with the 100 -year return period, and according the second one, it triggers during extreme rainfall as measured during the storm on September 18, 2007. For both scenarios, we used for debris-flow modeling a commercial two-dimensional mathematical model Flo- 2 d. The obtained results are shown in the form of computed flow depths and velocities over a cartographic background. The results show to possible catastrophic consequences in the village of Kropa, much worse that set in by torrential flood during the storm on September 18, 2007...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{application}} of different methods for estimation of magnitudes of rainfall-induced debris flows in 18 torrents in the Upper Sava River valley, NW Slovenia, and in 2 torrents in Pohorje, N Slovenia is described. Additional verification of the methods was performed in the torrential watersheds with active debris flows {{in the recent past}} (Predelica and Brusnik in the Soca River basin, W Slovenia). For some of the methods, the knowledge of morphometric characteristics of a <b>torrential</b> <b>watershed,</b> torrential channel and torrential fan is enough. For other methods, a mathematical tool (HEC-HMS) had to be applied in order to develop a hydrologic run-off model of precipitation that can trigger debris flows. Computed debris-flow magnitudes were of the order between 6, 500 m(3) and 340, 000 m(3). Their values are a function of <b>torrential</b> <b>watershed</b> parameters, such as: watershed area, Melton number, fan gradient, and torrential channel gradient. The investigated fans were classified into 3 groups with regard to the debris-flow hazard: debris-flow fans (hazard exists), torrential fans (no hazard), and transitional fans (debris flows are possible, but with low possibility). A limit between debris-flow fans and torrential fans is proposed: Melton number 0. 3 and torrential fan gradient 4 degrees, that is, 7 %. Out of 24 investigated torrential fans, 13 fans were classified into the group of debris-flow fans, 5 fans were classified into the group of torrential fans, and the rest 6 fans were classified into the group of transitional fans...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn mountains, {{natural hazards}} such as torrential {{phenomena}} are damageable for elements at risk. Land use management policies depend on natural risk analysis {{and on its}} reduction by protective measures such as civil engineering structures (e. g. check dams, dikes) and forest. Managing these systems is thus needed to help land use planning. It is related to multidisciplinary decision-making problems, from technical effectiveness assessment of protective measures (structural, functional) to their socio-economic efficiency to reduce risk. Decision-aiding tools such as Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) have been recently introduced in mountain watersheds’ management field. Nevertheless, traceability of involved expert reasoning is still missing such as the link between technical and socio-economic problems. This paper aims to show how decision-aiding tools can help to improve these aspects within an innovative integrated decision-aiding framework at the <b>torrential</b> <b>watershed</b> scale. Therefore, {{a brief overview of}} decision-aiding approaches, involving several theoretical frameworks, is provided. The integrated decision-aiding framework is then introduced. Finally, improvements are discussed showing that field applications are now needed...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Although {{natural hazards}} cannot be prevented, a better {{understanding}} of the processes and scientific methodologies for their prediction can help mitigate their impact. Torrential floods, as one of the consequential forms of the existing erosion processes in synergy with extremely high precipitation, are the most frequent natural hazard at the regional level, which was confirmed by the catastrophic events in May 2014 when huge territories of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia were flood-struck. The basic input data for the design of protective structures in <b>torrential</b> beds and <b>watershed</b> slopes are the values of the maximal discharge, area sediment yields, and sediment transport. The calculation of these values requires a careful approach in accordance with the characteristics of <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds,</b> such as the steepness of slopes and beds in <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds,</b> intensive erosion processes, favorable conditions for fast runoff formation and the transport of huge quantities of sediment. Materials and Methods: The calculations of maximal discharges, area sediment yields, and sediment transport in the experimental watershed of the Čađavica River were based on using two different spatial resolutions of digital elevations models (DEMs) – 20 m resolution DEM, with land use determined from aerial photo images, and the 90 m resolution DEM, with land use determined on the basis of the CORINE database. The computation of maximal discharges was performed by applying a method that combined synthetic unit hydrograph (maximum ordinate of unit runoff qmax) and Soil Conservation Service methodologies (deriving effective rainfall Pe from total precipitation Pb). The computation was performed for AMC III (Antecedent Moisture Conditions III – high content of water in the soil and significantly reduced infiltration capacity). The computations of maximal discharges were done taking into account the regional analysis of lag time, internal daily distribution of precipitation and classification of soil hydrologic groups (for CN – runoff curve number determination). Area sediment yields and the intensity of erosion processes were estimated on the basis of the “Erosion Potential Method”. Results and Conclusions: The selected methodology was performed using different input data related to the DEM resolution. The results were illustrated using cartographic and numerical data. Information on relief conditions is a vital parameter for calculating the elements of the environmental conditions through the elements of maximal discharge, area sediment yields and sediment transport. The higher precision of input data of DEM provides a more precise spatial identification and a quantitative estimation of the endangered sites...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ABSTRACT: Riparian {{vegetation}} and hydrogeomorphic processes are intimately connected parts of upland catchment and fan environments. Trees, shrubs and grasses and hydrogeomorphic processes interact and depend {{on each other}} in complex ways on the hillslopes, channels and cone‐shaped fans of <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds.</b> While the presence and density of vegetation have a profound influence on hydrogeomorphic processes, the occurrence of the latter will also exert control on the presence, vitality, species, and age distribution of vegetation. This contribution aims at providing a review of foundational and more recent work on the dependencies and interactions between hydrogeomorphic processes and vegetation. In particular, we address the role of vegetation in the initiation of hydrogeomorphic processes {{and its impact on}} stream morphology as well as immediate and long‐term effects of hydrogeomorphic disturbance on vegetation.

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes a}} new type of classification of dams in <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds.</b> This classification divides the dams according to the shape of the functional part of the dam into hierarchically arranged classes with the objective to be coherent, unambiguous, useable for data bases and as comprehensive and expandable as possible. On the irst (highest) hierarchical level all dams are divided into “Open Dams” and “Solid Body Dams”. The “Open Dams ” are classified on the second hierarchical level according to the shape of the openings and on the third hierarchical level according to the components that cover the openings in order to maintain their sustainable function. According to this hierarchical classification the “Open Dams” are designated by the use of a two-part nomenclature. The first part of the dam designation describes the shape of the openings and the second part the components that cover the openings. Additionally the dams can be specified by using attributes which refer to special designs of individual dam parts...|$|R
40|$|There is over 60 {{years of}} {{experience}} within ICAS on torrent control structures design and, together with Faculty of Silviculture and Forest Engineering from Braşov, represent watershed management history within Romanian forestry. Based on this activity a series of instructions and normative has been released in 1949, 1959, 1967, 1995. ICAS realized all spectrum of torrent control structures design for investments sector (around 2000 projects and studies during 1951 - 2011) and specific technical documentations such as: themes, instructions, normative in static dam calculation, morphometry and torrential watersheds hydrology, pluvial erosion and landslides mitigation using forest vegetation and complex management of torrential watersheds basins. According to ICAS studies, through whole national territory, in all 15 major catchments were managed 3, 201 torrential watersheds, {{in which they have}} been forested 67, 193. 4 ha of degraded lands and 2, 165. 2 km of torrential riverbed have been improved. The overwhelming majority of these works were designed by ICAS. For the future it is estimated that in the forest fund are required: 29, 936 ha afforestation of degraded land, 127, 000 m 3 of construction works necessary to ensure existing structures, the improvement of 1855 km of torrential riverbeds using torrent control structures. <b>Torrential</b> <b>watershed</b> planning issues are: chronic underfunding, permissive legislation in the auctions, the disappearance of traditional firms and workers. Finally is mentioned the opportunity offered by relatively new technology of Aerial Laser Scanners to delivery very accurate digital elevation models usable for better and faster design of specific works and the necessity of methodological research in this direction. With its available specialists, I. C. A.

40|$|Reducing {{the effects}} of natural hazards is an {{objective}} of prime necessity in {{the actions of the}} international cooperation within the European Union. The MONITOR II Project (in which Romsilva and ICAS are partners), have been identified hazards areas exposed to floods and landslides in the Basin Putna (testbed) by analyzing high-prone areas (due to natural factors) and the triggers exceeding averages (the presence of eroded and sliding lands, the intensity of degradation processes, land use, hydrological effectiveness of uses etc.). For prevention and risk reduction, main measures specific all partners are: - spatial planning of <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds,</b> afforestation of degraded lands, promote agriculture and forestry in the context of sustainable use of natural resources (soil, water, forest); - monitoring of sensitive areas. For this purpose it is necessary to create networks of information, evaluation, assessment, observation and preventive warning, to highlight any changes in climatic and hydrological factors, and to establish measures and actions on solving concrete problems, at regional and local level (setting emergency intervention, necessary works, financial effort, etc.). floods and landslides hazard, natural disaster, watershed, monitorin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn 1995, a law stated {{a common}} {{regulatory}} natural risk zoning for French municipalities through a land-use planning procedure called Risk Prevention Plan (PPR). In mountain valleys and especially within <b>torrential</b> <b>watersheds,</b> considering protective structures in those plans is an actual concern. Those protections {{do have an}} effect on phenomena and modify hazard and risk levels. This paper gives an overview on how torrential protective works are taken into account in present risk prevention plans. To carry out this study, 53 recent risk prevention plans over 11 French mountain departments were selected and analyzed through a common analysis grid. Torrential protection works are taken into account in more than one third of analyzed plans. Protections mostly considered are dikes, bank protections, check-dams and sediment traps. Modalities of integration of these structures vary from one plan to another, influencing both hazard and regulatory zoning. Results also show a wide range of practices between departments and even inside them. Conclusions brought out enhance knowledge about actual practices which were not sufficiently known so far. Findings and new additional recommendations will be included in a future PPR methodological guide exclusively suited for torrential context, which is currently still missing...|$|R
