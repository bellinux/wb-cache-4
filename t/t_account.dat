Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are frequently used in performing these assessments. While {{there is considerable}} {{evidence to support the}} utility of using TRLs in assessing program risk, there are some difficulties in using TRLs with software.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{algorithm}} {{to optimize the}} energy-efficiency (EE) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based cognitive radio systems under channel uncertainties. We formulate an optimization problem that guarantees a minimum required rate and a specified power budget for the secondary user (SU), while restricting the interference to primary users (PUs) in a statistical manner. The optimization problem is non-convex and it is transformed to an equivalent problem using the concept of fractional programming. Unlike all related works in the literature, we consider the effect of imperfect channel-stateinformation (CSI) on the links between the SU transmitter and receiver pairs and we additionally consider the effect of limited sensing capabilities of the SU. Since the interference constraints are met statistically, the SU transmitter does not require perfect CSI feedback from the PUs receivers. Simulation results sho w that the EE deteriorates as the channel estimation error increases. Comparisons with relevant works from the literature show that the interference thresholds at the PUs receivers can be severely exceeded and the EE is slightly deteriorated if the SU does no <b>t</b> <b>account</b> for spectrum sensing errors.

40|$|Classical {{thermoelasticity}} {{theory is}} based on Fourier 2 ̆ 7 s Law of heat conduction, which, when combined with the other fundamental field equations, leads to coupled hyperbolic-parabolic governing equations. These equations imply that thermal effects are to be felt instantaneously, {{far away from the}} external thermomechanieal load. Therefore, this theory admits infinite speeds of propagation of thermoelastic disturbances. This paradox becomes especially evident in problems involving very short time intervals, or high rates. of heat flux. Since infinite wave speeds are physically unrealistic in some situations, and since experiments have shown the existence of wavetype thermoelastic interactions, like in the observation of thermal pulses in dielectric crystals, 2 ̆ 2 generalized 2 ̆ 2 thermoelasticity theories have been developed. This thesis concentrates on one generalized thermoelasticity theory, proposed by Green and Lindsay, in which a generalized thermoelastic coupling constant, e, and two relaxation times, t 0 and <b>t,</b> <b>account</b> for finite speed thermoelastic waves. A numerical analysis of an exact analytical solution, involving an instantaneous plane source of heat in an infinite body, is performed.

40|$|Hypertension is {{a leading}} cause of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. The genetic basis of blood {{pressure}} variation is largely unknown but is likely to involve genes that influence renal salt handling and arterial vessel tone. Here we argue that susceptibility to hypertension is ancestral and that differential susceptibility to hypertension is due to differential exposure to selection pressures during the out-of-Africa expansion. The most important selection pressure was climate, which produced a latitudinal cline in heat adaptation and, therefore, hypertension susceptibility. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that ecological variables, such as latitude, temperature, and rainfall, explain worldwide variation in heat adaptation as defined by seven functional alleles in five genes involved in blood pressure regulation. The latitudinal cline in heat adaptation is consistent worldwide and is largely unmatched by latitudinal clines in non-functional markers. In addition, we show that latitude and one of these alleles, GNB 3 (G protein b 3 subunit) 825 <b>T,</b> <b>account</b> for a major portion of worldwide variation in blood pressure. These results suggest that the current epidemic of hypertension is due to exposures of the modern period interacting with ancestral susceptibility. Modern populations differ in susceptibility to these new exposures, however, such that those from hot environments are more susceptible to hypertension than populations from cold environments. This differential susceptibility is likely due to our history of adaptation to climate...|$|E

The ground is effectively an infinite medium, often with a layered structure and with properties that may vary greatly from one location to another. The vibration from a passing train forms a transient event, which limits the usefulness of steady-state frequency domain models. Moreover, {{there is often a}} need to consider vehicle/track interaction in more detail than is commonly used in frequency domain models, such as the 2. 5 D approach, while maintaining the computational efficiency of the latter. However, full time-domain approaches involve large computation times, particularly where three-dimensional ground models are required. Here, a hybrid modelling approach is introduced. The vehicle/track interaction is calculated in the time domain {{in order to be able}} <b>t</b> <b>account</b> directly for effects such as the discrete sleeper spacing. Forces acting on the ground are extracted from this first model and used in a second model to predict the ground response at arbitrary locations. In the present case the second model is a layered ground model operating in the frequency domain. Validation of the approach is provided by comparison with an existing frequency domain model. The hybrid model is then used to study the sleeper-passing effect, which is shown to be less significant than excitation due to track unevenness in all the cases considered...|$|E

In {{contrast to the}} effects of ouabain on ion composition, intracellular K+ was maintained at about 125 meq/liter, and intracellular Na+ was almost nil in the Na+-free media. The estimates of QO 2 (t) were independent of the considerable differences in tissue ion concentrations.

Thyroidectomy was attended by significant falls in serum Ca and Pi concentrations. Administration of T 3 resulted in further declines in serum Ca and marked increases in serum Ps concentrations. Similar effects were seen in 131 I-treated rats, but the magnitude of the declines in serum Ca were less.

40|$|In {{existing}} {{tropical cyclone}} research and forecast models, {{the description of}} the boundary layer (BL) is typically based on local gradients of mean wind and potential temperature and vertical diffusivity coefficients. In the commonly used K theory, the turbulence is represented by an eddy-diffusivity coefficient, K, which is typically parameterized {{as a function of the}} local Richardson number. The most fundamental limitation of K theory is that it doesn 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>account</b> for transfer of heat, moisture, and momentum caused by convective motion or roll vortices, which are known to be common feature of the atmospheric BL. In this study numerical experiments are performed to investigate the BL roll vortices using a two and a half dimensional (2. 5 D) BL model. This model, first introduced by Khain et al. (1986), explicitly calculates a two-way interaction between the mean flow and convective motion and thus serves as a suitable tool to study the impact of BL convection on the mean flow. ^ The model results show that the Coriolis force can affect BL roll vortices through mean flow. There are more energetic rolls in the presence of Coriolis force. Model results also show that roll vortices trigger internal gravity waves in the stable inversion layer when taking into account the effect of the Coriolis force on the mean flow. The interaction between the BL roll vortices and the internal gravity waves increases the aspect ratio of roll vortices, promotes stronger rolls, enhances the entrainment process, decreases the roll-induced momentum and heat fluxes and weakens the non-local mixing generated by roll vortices. The wave frequency and wave number of the internal gravity waves in the stable inversion layer increase with the increase of the inversion layer stability. Convective motion generated by clouds compensates the condensation and evaporation process by transporting heat from the cloud base to the cloud top. Latent heat release can increase the aspect ratio of roll vortices, suppress BL roll vortices, and increase the near surface air temperature. Strong clouds tend to dampen the internal gravity waves in the stable inversion layer. ...|$|E
