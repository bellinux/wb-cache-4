5|$|Dragonflies are {{attracted}} to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water, {{and they have been}} known to aggregate close to polished gravestones, solar panels, automobiles, and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs.

5|$|A {{special case}} of natural {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E

The tunnel was listed as one of many projects that could receive federal funds that were to have been allocated to the Access to the Region's Core tunnel, which was canceled in October 2010.

5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is the zebra. The bold stripes of the zebra have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes these trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E

It has been found that the decommunization process greatly increases <b>the</b> tourism <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> regions through <b>the</b> creation of parks and museums of the Soviet past, acquiring the new image by cities and towns after changing their names.

25|$|Heat {{exchangers}} are expensive, requiring {{drilling for}} some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient, {{and the heat}} pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency. Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage {{when it comes to}} initial investment (not long-term savings) compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers, so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards. Electricity rates will also influence <b>the</b> <b>attractiveness</b> <b>of</b> heat pumps.|$|E
