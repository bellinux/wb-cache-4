5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} or leisure {{sociology}} {{is the study}} of how humans organize their free time.

More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture.|$|E

Culture is also the subject of a burgeoning sociological literature. This includes the establishment of <b>the</b> journal Cultural <b>Sociology,</b> <b>the</b> first international <b>sociology</b> periodical exclusively dedicated to the examination of cultural matters...|$|R

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of risk, rural sociology and <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of disaster.|$|E

5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is the study}} of how humans {{organize}} their free time.

5|$|The Religion of India: <b>The</b> <b>Sociology</b> of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} work on <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of religion. In this work {{he deals with}} the {{structure}} of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E

5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. <b>The</b> <b>sociology</b> of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sociology</b> {{of health}} and illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This {{sub-field}} also overlaps with gerontology {{and the study of}} the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E
5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. <b>The</b> <b>sociology</b> of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the {{university}} changed again its organizational structure into Faculties, and new programs were created, for example Social Communication and Journalism, Social Work {{were established in}} the Faculty of Humanities. In 1977, {{in order to avoid}} the desertion of several faculty members, it was established the professorship career system based in academic, investigative, and administrative merits. In 1976, with the creation of the Socio Economical Research Center, the first steps into the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Sociology</b> program in 1978 were taken.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major work on <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of religion, Weber {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E

5|$|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism was Weber's {{second major}} work on <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and {{translated}} this text into English, with an introduction by C. K. Wang. Weber focused on {{those aspects of}} Chinese society that were {{different from those of}} Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with Puritanism. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sociology</b> of {{race and}} of ethnic {{relations}} is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|Weber's most {{influential}} work was on economic sociology, political sociology, and <b>the</b> <b>sociology</b> of religion. Along with Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, he is commonly {{regarded as one}} of the founders of modern sociology. But whereas Durkheim, following Comte, worked in the positivist tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition in the social sciences. In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues Werner Sombart, Georg Simmel, and Wilhelm Dilthey, who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.|$|E
