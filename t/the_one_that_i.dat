Bloom explained: [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} convince Yoko Ono that {{it was the right thing}} to do. She needed to truly understand how the music was going to be used. The added component of us wanting to have a deaf choir signing the song made for this incredibly poignant moment. ...It really took a lot of convincing to get her on board and realize that it was a great, great moment, and a tribute to John and his song."

Its fast rhythm made Stannard remember the scene where John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John perform [...] "You're <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Want" [...] in Grease.

Murphy {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: [...] "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience."

According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at [...] in diameter were then the largest ever made, were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593. Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: [...] "The whole earth, a present for a Prince ..."; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: [...] "Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of <b>the</b> <b>one,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may enjoy but a mansion place in this other."

It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E
