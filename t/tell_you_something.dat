500|$|Presley began {{speaking}} to the audience between songs about various different things. During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] If I find the individual who said that about me, I’m going to break your neck, you son-of-a-bitch. I will pull your goddamn tongue out by the roots." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} afternoon, Reds publicist {{and traveling}} secretary Gabe Paul called Hershberger's {{room at the}} Copley Plaza Hotel after Hershberger missed batting practice. He said that he wasn't going to play that afternoon because he wasn't feeling well; McKechnie, worried, wanted him there in street clothes, and Hershberger agreed. After he missed {{the first game of}} another doubleheader against the Bees, McKechnie had Dan Cohen, a friend of Hershberger's, head to the hotel to check up on him. He found the door locked, and asked an employee to open the door. Inside, Cohen found Hershberger's body by the bathtub with his throat slit. After the second game, McKechnie had coach Hank Gowdy bring all the players together in the locker room, stating, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Willard Hershberger has just destroyed himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E

500|$|Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf {{speaking}} to Raymond Seitz, then Minister at the US Embassy in London, [...] "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We {{have lived in}} peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> In war, innocent people always suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall {{soon have}} to tell {{everybody}} everything about it," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "but I've no objection to <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> first.

5000|$|Looking back at {{his career}} in 1970, Garagiola observed, [...] "It's not a record, but being traded four times when there are only eight {{teams in the league}} <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> I thought I was {{modeling}} uniforms for the National League." ...|$|R
2500|$|On February 28, 2017, Rapaport {{released}} an {{edition of his}} podcast, I Am Rapaport, in which he fired back at the show once again, repeatedly insulting Le Batard and co-host Stugotz.

Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> If I'm going down, the whole s— is burning down. If I'm going down, we’re talking about defamation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2006, St. James {{embarked}} on her If I Had One Chance To <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> <b>Something</b> Tour with fellow Christian group BarlowGirl.

2500|$|St. James rose to fame in {{the late}} 1990s with her RIAA {{certified}} Gold albums God and Pray, the latter of which won a Grammy Award in 1999 for Best Rock Gospel Album.

2500|$|According to The War for Late Night, [...] "the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC {{came to call}} it—changed the tone.

Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?" [...] Conversations changed as to how much O'Brien would take to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Toby Harnden {{said that}} IRA members in South Armagh {{who talked to}} him in the late 1990s {{generally}} condemned the massacre. One of them, Volunteer M, was quoted as saying that it was [...] "a gut reaction [...] and a wrong one. The worst time in my life was in jail after Kingsmill. It was a dishonourable time". Another, Volunteer G, was quoted as saying that he [...] "never agreed with Kingsmill". Republican activist Peter John Caraher said that those ultimately responsible were [...] "the loyalists who shot the Reavey brothers". He added, [...] "It was sad that those people [...] had to die, but I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> it stopped any more Catholics being killed". This view was reiterated by a County Tyrone republican and Gaelic Athletic Association veteran who spoke to Ed Moloney. [...] "It's a lesson you learn quickly on the football field...

Colin Worton, whose brother was killed in the massacre, said [...] "Kingsmill did stop Catholics being killed in South Armagh, but that doesn't justify it".|$|E
2500|$|At Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek {{writes that}} Dark Willow is [...] "far {{from being a}} cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the {{momentum}} of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff." [...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
