5|$|On 17 October 2012, the {{executive}} producer Martin Österdahl told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that SVT plans for the 2013 Contest to have only one presenter for the entire contest, unlike previous years where there were up to three presenters per show. The last time <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one presenter was in the 1995 Contest, in Dublin, Ireland, when the solo host was Mary Kennedy. Petra Mede was announced as the host for the 2013 contest on 28 January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing camera crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{council was}} short-lived: <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one {{legislative}} session. Less {{than a year}} after its formation, the smallpox crisis in the District of Keewatin subsided. The Department of the Interior determined that a territorial government for the district was no longer needed. The entire council resigned and was effectively dissolved after being requested to do so on April 16, 1877, by Secretary of State James Aikins. Aikins had the council resign as a cost-saving measure; also he did not want members of the council to abuse the powers of their appointments.|$|E

5|$|Gregorio Bundio and his {{assistant}} José Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. This {{was the first time}} El Salvador participated in World Cup qualifying. As host, Mexico automatically qualified so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one qualification spot up for grabs. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result, they qualified for a 3-game playoff against group 2 winner and traditional rival, Honduras. The first game, hosted on 8 June 1969 in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, was won 1–0 by the home team and was followed by crowd violence. The second game, hosted on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, was won 3–0 by El Salvador, and was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by these matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the 100-hour-long war known as the Football War. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were both disqualified from entering the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{controversy}} among modern historians {{arising from the}} narrative of Titus Livius, {{the major source of}} this event, who describes two battles taking place in the span of two years (in 212 BC and 210 BC) at the same place (Herdonia) between Hannibal and Roman commanders with similar names (Gn. Fulvius Flaccus and Gn. Fulvius Centumalus). Some state that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one battle in fact, but there is no general agreement on this issue.|$|E
25|$|The EFL {{award was}} instituted in 2005. Prior to that, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one award for teams from non-English-speaking countries.

25|$|Construction of dams in the San Joaquin {{watershed}} has led {{to nearly}} all of the good spawning streams, located higher in the mountains near the headwaters of the San Joaquin and its tributaries, being cut off to the salmon. The remaining areas left for the salmon to spawn in are undesirable. Prior to the building of the Friant Dam in 1944, the San Joaquin River was believed to have over 6,000 miles of streambed suitable and available to spawning salmon. However, in 1993 it was estimated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 300 miles.|$|E

25|$|Later the {{emphasis}} was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From {{the latter part of}} the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It used paper tape to store programs. Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.|$|E
25|$|For {{elections}} to Dáil Éireann, Kilkenny {{is part of}} the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency which returns 5 TDs. The present form of the constituency was created for the 1948 general election. Kilkenny has been represented through several parliamentary constituencies in the past. From 1918–1921 Kilkenny was part of the North Kilkenny United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency. In 1921 the Carlow–Kilkenny Dáil Éireann constituency was created and has stayed apart from between 1937 and 1948 when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a Kilkenny constituency. The TDs serving the area are currently John J. McGuinness, Phil Hogan, John Paul Phelan, Pat Deering and Ann Phelan.|$|E

25|$|From the 1850s, horse-drawn omnibuses {{provided}} transport along South Richmond Street from Rathmines to {{the city}} centre. On 6 October 1871 work was commenced on the Dublin tram system on Rathmines Road, {{a few yards from}} Portobello Bridge. They came into operation the following year, linking Rathgar, via Richmond Street, with College Green. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one standard fare within the city limits, which was much cheaper than the old horse-drawn omnibuses. That year also the long-awaited improvements to Portobello Bridge (after the fatal accident of 1861) were carried out, the Tramway Company paying one third of the total cost of £300.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half Cork were the {{dominant}} team. This was helped {{by the addition of}} two of Cork's more experienced players to the game: Nicholas Murphy was brought on as a substitute at half-time by Cork manager Conor Counihan, while Graham Canty was brought on as a substitute soon afterwards. In the 56th minute Paul Kerrigan gave Cork back the lead which they relinquished after five minutes, with Goulding boosting this lead by scoring three '45s. Down's Benny Coulter and Daniel Hughes scored in the dying minutes but it was too late, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a single point between the sides. Cork were victorious.|$|E
25|$|There were no cartels at {{that time}} in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> him, his cronies, and the {{politicians}} who sold him protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.|$|E
