The <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a higher level of phosphatase activity in their walls. The corresponding protoplasts regenerating a cell wall exhibited a higher rate of Î²-glucan synthesis and cellulose deposition was increased in the walls of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells.</b> A higher level of plasma membrane glucan synthase activities was also measured in detergent extracts of membrane fractions from the transgenic line, while no activation of Golgi-bound glycan synthases was detected. Enzymatic hydrolysis and methylation analysis were performed on the products synthesized in vitro by the plasma membrane enzymes from the wild-type and transgenic lines extracted with digitonin and incubated with radioactive UDP-glucose. The data showed that the glucans consisted of callose and cellulose and that the amount of each glucan synthesized by the enzyme preparation from the <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> was significantly higher than in the case of the wild-type cells.

In mice carrying viral jun (v-jun) as a transgene, wounding {{is a prerequisite}} for tumorigenesis, suggesting collaboration between the transgene and a wound-related event. To define possible candidates for this collaborative process, we examined the effect of several wound-related polypeptide growth factors on <b>cells</b> from <b>transgenic</b> mice. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1 alpha induce anchorage independence in embryo fibroblasts and tumor cell revertants from these mice. This effect was specific for the two cytokines and was restricted to <b>cells</b> from v-jun <b>transgenic</b> mice. Anchorage independence required the continued presence of the cytokines. Transfection of <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> with a v-jun expression plasmid also induced anchorage independence and a tumorigenic phenotype in <b>transgenic</b> tumor <b>cell</b> revertants. However, there was no correlation between anchorage independence, expression of Jun, and AP- 1 activity.

Due to the lack of robust cell lines and small animal models, the pathogenesis of PRRSV infection and mechanism for protective vaccination are still not yet well understood. To obtain useful cell lines, several groups have attempted to construct different <b>transgenic</b> <b>cell</b> lines with three PRRSV receptors: CD 163, CD 169, and CD 151. The results showed that CD 163 is essential for PRRSV entry into target cells and replication, and both CD 169 and CD 151 play key roles during PRRSV infection. However, their interplay and combined effect remains unclear. In this study, we generated transgenic BHK- 21 derived cell lines co-expressing different combinations of the three receptors, which were transfected with CD 163 alone, or the combination of CD 163 and CD 169, or the combination of CD 163 and CD 151, or the combination of CD 163, CD 169, and CD 151 using the PiggyBac transposon system. Our results showed that the synergistic interaction among the three receptors was important to improve the susceptibility of cells during PRRSV infection.

These results demonstrate that over-expression of FPS can break the rate-limiting reaction catalyzed by FPS in the triterpene saponins biosynthetic pathway; and inhibition of CAS expression can decrease the synthesis metabolic flux of the phytosterol branch. Thus, more precursors flow in the direction of triterpene synthesis, and ultimately promote the accumulation of P. notoginseng saponins.

The <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> showed elevated levels of mouse ODC enzyme activity, severalfold higher amounts of putrescine, a small increase in spermidine, and a small reduction in spermine as compared with NT cells. The conversion of labeled ornithine (Orn) into putrescine was significantly higher in the transgenic than the NT cells.

30|$|The use of {{positive}} selectable marker genes is widespread in plant genetic transformation allowing <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> to grow while repressing non-transgenic cells. Negative selectable markers, on the contrary, allow the repression or ablation of <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells.</b> The codA gene of Escherichia coli encodes cytosine deaminase that hydrolyzes 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) into the cytotoxic compound 5 fluorouracil. We tested the transgenic {{expression of the}} bacterial codA gene in citrus as a conditional negative selection marker, {{with the goal of}} selecting against plant tissues in which a transgenic cassette has not been successfully removed. We developed transgenic citrus lines containing the selection cassette, codA::nptII, driven by double enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter, verified by Southern blot analysis, RT-PCR, DsRed expression and subjected these transgenic lines to a 5 -FC sensitivity assay. We found that, while non-transgenic citrus were unaffected by the presence of 5 -FC, all of the transformed lines displayed symptoms of toxicity, indicating that the codA gene {{could be used as a}} negative selectable marker in Citrus, for post-transformation detection of the removal of undesired sequences.|$|R

This <b>transgenic</b> <b>cell</b> line reproducibly differentiates into EGFP-expressing cardiomyocytes (CMs) which can be generated at high purity with puromycin treatment and exhibit molecular and functional properties of immature heart muscle cells. This genetically modified iPSC line can be used for assessment of the utility of CMs for myocardial repair, pharmacological and toxicological applications and development of improved cardiac differentiation protocols...|$|E

This compliments previous experiments in which manipulation of early genes in the pathway, such as adc and odc, resulted in changes in PA concentrations in <b>transgenic</b> <b>cell</b> lines and plants...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented here}} {{were performed to}} evaluate immune responsiveness of hepatitis B virus (HBV) -transgenic mice (transgenic mice), {{as a model of}} HBV-carrier state to a T-cell-dependent antigen, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). The transgenic mice which were completely unresponsive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), responded poorly to KLH. The levels of anti-KLH antibodies (Ab) produced in vivo were significantly lower in transgenic mice compared with the normal control mice at respective immunizing doses of KLH. In addition, a little or no anti-KLH Ab production was detected in culture supernatants of KLH-primed <b>transgenic</b> mice spleen <b>cells.</b> KLH-primed T cells from normal and transgenic mice induced anti-KLH Ab production from <b>transgenic</b> B <b>cells</b> in the presence of antigen-presenting spleen adherent cells (SAC) from normal mice, but not those from transgenic mice. Depletion of dendritic cells from normal mice-derived SAC completely abrogated the anti-KLH Ab response in <b>transgenic</b> spleen <b>cell</b> culture and their addition to the culture restored the response. Low efficiency of <b>transgenic</b> dendritic <b>cells</b> was demonstrated in sodium periodate (NaIO 4) -induced non-specific and allogenic antigen-induced T-cell proliferation. Finally, cytofluorometric analyses showed a reduced Ia antigen expression on <b>transgenic</b> dendritic <b>cells.</b> These results indicate that low responsiveness of transgenic mice in specific-antibody response is not due to functional defects in T cells or B cells but rather to a defect of antigen-presenting activity of dendritic cells...|$|R

C. roseus transient <b>transgenic</b> <b>cells</b> were homogenized in protein extraction buffer (0.05 Â M NaPO 4, pHÂ  7.0, 0.1 % SDS, 10 Â mM EDTA, 20 % methanol, 10 Â mM Î²-ME, Triton X- 100) and centrifuged.
