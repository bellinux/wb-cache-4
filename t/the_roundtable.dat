5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Roundtable</b> on Sustainable Biofuels is an {{international}} initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists {{who are interested in}} the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Roundtable</b> used meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions to develop a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Roundtable</b> on Sustainable Biofuels {{launched}} {{a set of}} comprehensive sustainability criteria - the “RSB Certification System.” Biofuels producers that meet to these criteria are able to show buyers and regulators that their product has been obtained without harming the environment or violating human rights.|$|E

5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. <b>The</b> <b>Roundtable</b> Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the Eastern bloc. Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the Eastern Bloc, weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>roundtables</b> {{have stated}} several P&C’s which {{should result in}} {{a higher level of}} {{sustainability}} within the oil palm and soybean concessions. However, the general conclusion can be made that these P&C’s are not detailed enough to become effective. Lack of details have the result that companies are free to implement the P&C according to their own interpretation. Result is that same certified growers might act on a different level of sustainability. Deforestation of primary forest is not specifically reduced with the implementation of the P&C. This is mainly because the HCV assessment is not implemented on a proper manner and HCV habitats are not protected by the growers or the government. Result is that the potential of <b>the</b> <b>roundtables</b> to protect forest against deforestation is low. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>roundtables</b> do not prohibit the conversion of secondary or degraded forest in order to protect biodiversity within and beyond the plantations. <b>The</b> different <b>roundtables</b> stated several management practices which might be implemented. Research showed that if appropriately implemented and managed, these activities might contribute to the conservation of animal and plant species. However, a proper HCV assessment is essential before these management activities are implemented within the concessions. Failure in the protection of HCVs will result in the destructing of these habitats. In <b>the</b> future <b>the</b> <b>roundtables</b> should improve their P&C and implement the conservation of High Carbon Stock areas. This will result in the protection of even secondary forest. If this assessment is properly implemented, this will increase the sustainability standard of <b>the</b> <b>roundtables...</b>|$|R

In mid- 2000, the US DOE, Wisconsin Division of Energy, and Energy Center of Wisconsin (ECW) sponsored Industry of <b>the</b> Future <b>roundtables</b> for <b>the</b> state metalcasting and forest products industries. <b>The</b> <b>roundtables</b> were cornerstone events in a broader state effort to address energy, environmental, and competitiveness issues with state industry. Those issues are central to the federal Industries of the Future strategy, and by leveraging national resources, Wisconsin has a strong structure from which to build. This paper focuses mainly on the role of <b>the</b> industry <b>roundtables</b> in this building process. <b>The</b> <b>roundtables,</b> along with follow-up activities, met four objectives: 1) bring together experts from Wisconsin industry, research organizations, and government to discuss how to make Wisconsin industry more competitive, 2) create brainstormed lists of industry needs on energy, environmental, and production issues, 3) translate needs into potential R&D and demonstration projects, and 4) support formation of collaborative teams to implement projects. Results of <b>the</b> <b>roundtables</b> were summarized in state roadmaps – an outline of R&D and demonstration areas that would benefit state industry. Many stated needs had related projects ongoing, either at the state or national level. With the addition of state assistance for projects under a new state public benefits charge, and continuing support from the US DOE, the state roadmaps serve as a planning tool for generating partnerships to implement the projects...|$|R
