5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, which has led <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth {{to as many as}} 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
40|$|How {{we should}} manage genetic {{diversity}} depends on why {{we want to}} manage it. The most generally useful strategy is to maintain variation across the genome, using methods that consider one or more of: population size, population structure, animal selections, mate allocations and information from genetic markers. A key reason <b>to</b> maintain <b>genetic</b> diversity is <b>to</b> facilitate longer-term <b>genetic</b> gains, and this means that most breeding programs need <b>to</b> consider <b>genetic</b> diversity as well as shorter-term genetic gains. This paper discusses these issues, and presents developments in methods <b>to</b> integrate <b>genetic</b> gains, genetic diversity and other issues within breeding programs...|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{legislation}} {{pertaining to}} the use of genetic information and genetic discrimination at the state level varies by state.

More recent laws have permitted individuals <b>to</b> undergo <b>genetic</b> testing when that individual is filing a compensation claim or has requested the test to demonstrate susceptibility to potentially toxic substances.|$|R

5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> variation than gene duplication.

Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E

5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> studies.|$|E

5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform. The processes by which the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection (including sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> admixture. Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all genetic {{variation}} is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Two coat color genes {{found in}} Morgans {{have also been}} linked <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> disorders. One is the genetic ocular {{syndrome}} multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA {{is characterized by the}} abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if heterozygous, but when homozygous can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are homozygous for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy heterozygous frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are heterozygous for frame overo to each other.|$|E
5|$|While a few leopard sharks {{have been}} {{documented}} traveling hundreds of kilometers, most individuals tend to remain in a localized area for much of their lives. This low level of dispersal has led <b>to</b> <b>genetic</b> divergence across its range. Seven discrete gene pools have been identified along the Californian coast between Humboldt Bay and San Diego. Of these, the Humboldt Bay subpopulation {{is perhaps the most}} isolated, with the sharks there maturing at a larger size and producing fewer offspring than those from other areas. By contrast, the area around Los Angeles represents a genetic transitional zone between subpopulations whose boundaries are more diffuse. Off Baja California, the leopard sharks on the Pacific side are probably distinct from those in the northern Gulf of California. Although there is equivocal evidence for natal philopatry (returning to one's birthplace to breed) in this species, proximity to established breeding grounds likely contributes to the structuring of these different subpopulations.|$|E

Section IV argues that the failure <b>to</b> give <b>genetic</b> information special protection in the law has potentially harmful consequences.
