25|$|In the Netherlands, {{they are}} {{traditionally}} eaten with fresh savory and some melted butter. The {{combination of the}} beans <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> crispy fried bacon is also common. When rubbed, the velvet insides of the pods are a folk remedy against warts.|$|E
25|$|When pasta was {{introduced}} to several nations, every culture adopted different style of preparing it. In the past, ancient Romans cooked pastas by frying or boiling it. It was also sweetened with honey or <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> garum. Ancient Romans also enjoyed baking it in rich pies, called timballi.|$|E
25|$|Many egg, fish, {{and other}} dishes employ fresh or dried fennel leaves. Florence fennel {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in some Italian and German salads, often <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> chicory and avocado, {{or it can be}} braised and served as a warm side dish. It may be blanched or marinated, or cooked in risotto.|$|E

2500|$|An [...] {{is another}} group of items, describable {{as a sort of}} [...] "tossed salad" [...] or [...] "dressed" [...] (though aemono also {{includes}} thin strips of squid or fish sashimi (itozukuri) etc. similarly prepared). One types are [...] where usually vegetables such as green beans are <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> white or black sesame seeds ground in a suribachi mortar bowl, flavored additionally with sugar and soy sauce. [...] adds tofu (bean curd) in the mix. An aemono is <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> vinegar-white miso mix and uses wakegi scallion and [...] as standard.|$|E
2500|$|First the wok {{is heated}} {{to a high}} temperature, and just as or before it smokes, {{a small amount of}} cooking oil is added {{down the side of the}} wok (a {{traditional}} expression is [...] "hot wok, cold oil"), followed by dry seasonings such as ginger, garlic, scallions, or shallots. The seasonings are <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> a spatula until they are fragrant, then other ingredients are added, beginning with the ones taking the longest to cook, such as meat or tofu. When the meat and vegetables are nearly cooked, combinations of soy sauce, vinegar, wine, salt, or sugar may be added, along with thickeners such as cornstarch, water chestnut flour, or arrowroot.|$|E
2500|$|As in many coastal states, seafood {{is readily}} available. Shellfish is {{extremely}} popular, with clams {{being used in}} multiple ways. The quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. (The word quahog comes from the Narragansett Indian word [...] "poquauhock"; see A Key into the Language of America by Roger Williams 1643.) It is also ground and mixed with stuffing (and sometimes spicy minced sausage) and then baked in its shell to form a stuffie. Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried and is served as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically Sicilian-style (i.e., <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> sliced banana peppers and with marinara sauce on the side).|$|E

60|$|Now, {{that this}} fine wind had sprung up; the sun riding joyously in the heavens; and the Lagoon all <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> white, flying manes; Media called upon Yoomy to ransack his whole {{assortment}} of songs:--warlike, amorous, and sentimental,--and regale us with something inspiring {{for too long}} the company had been gloomy.|$|E

60|$|In the profoundly silent {{heart of}} {{a house full of}} {{sleeping}} serving-men and maids, Pierre now sat in his chamber before his accustomed round table, still <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> the books and the papers which, three days before, he had abruptly left, for a sudden and more absorbing object. Uppermost and most conspicuous among the books were the Inferno of Dante, and the Hamlet of Shakspeare.|$|E
6000|$|I {{told you}} before, That the ark was {{a type of}} Christ, and also {{of the works of}} the faith of the godly.

60|$|But {{everybody}} {{takes an}} embryo human being with some plan of one's own what it shall do or be. The child's future shall shape out some darling purpose or plan, and fulfill some long unfulfilled expectation of the parent. And thus, though {{the wind of}} every generation sweeps its hopes and plans like forest-leaves, none are whirled and <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> more piteous moans than those which come out green and fresh to shade the happy spring-time of the cradle. For the temperaments of children are often as oddly unsuited to parents as if capricious fairies had been filling cradles with changelings.|$|E

60|$|He blenched, and {{partially}} rose, unable {{to conceal his}} dismay. She, resolved not to be cast off, seized him and clung to him. This was the movement that excited the derision of Wickens's boy in the adjacent gravel pit. Trefusis was glad of the interruption; and, when he gave the boy twopence and bade him begone, half hoped that he would insist on remaining. But though an obdurate boy on most occasions, he proved complaisant on this, and withdrew to the high road, where he made over one of his pennies to a phantom gambler, and <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> him until recalled from his dual state {{by the appearance of}} Fairholme's party.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} very remarkable in {{the combination of these}} qualities, as well as in their separate possession. Most men who might be happy enough to have one half his love of justice, would be so <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> storms of indignation at injustice as to lose the balance of their judgment. But he had or seemed to have all the benefits, all the ennobling force of strong emotion, with a complete exemption from its dangers. His mind seemed to move in an atmosphere of chartered tranquillity, which allowed him the view of every object, however blinding to others, in its true position and proportion.|$|E
60|$|It {{was several}} {{minutes before he}} {{returned}}. I began to wonder whether he had changed his mind, and returned to Rowchester with Lady Angela. Then the door handle suddenly turned, and he stepped in. His hair was <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> the wind, his shoes were wet and covered with mud, and he was breathing rather fast, {{as though he had}} been running. I looked at him inquiringly. He offered me no explanation. But {{on his way to the}} chair, which he presently drew up to the fire, he paused for a full minute by the window, and shading the carriage lamp which he still carried, with his hand, he looked steadily out into the darkness. A thought struck me.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Dunster relapsed into stony but anxious silence. The train {{continued}} its erratic progress, sometimes stopping altogether for a time, with whistle blowing repeatedly; sometimes creeping along the metals as though feeling {{its way to}} safety. At last, after a somewhat prolonged wait, the guard, whose hoarse voice they had heard on the platform of the small station {{in which they were}} standing, entered the carriage. With him came a gust of wind, once more sending the papers flying around the compartment. The rain dripped from his clothes on to the carpet. He had lost his hat, his hair was <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> the wind, his face was bleeding from a slight wound on the temple.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact I don't know which of them thought of it because I never inquired.

How much more then, he may have argued, could it inhabit a flash of lightning which has always been considered a divine manifestation {{from the time of the}} Roman Jove, and no doubt far before him.|$|E

Enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful, and that my only hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast importance to the holy Church, and affects greatly her power, wealth, and dominion on these shores. But the terms of this secret and the conditions of my absolution are peculiar. I have but five minutes to live. In that time I must receive the extreme unction of the Church." ...|$|E
