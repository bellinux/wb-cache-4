500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] on her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). The {{song was}} the penultimate track {{on the tour}} setlist, before the show's encore, [...] "Holiday". For the performance, Madonna invited {{a member of the}} audience to join her during the song, and while dancing with them and playfully spanking the guest, she finished the performance giving a banana as a [...] "gift". The first guest during the opening night in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was the song's producer Diplo. The singer turned him around and simulated insertion of the fruit, while saying: [...] "There’s so many <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with a banana." [...] Other celebrities given bananas by Madonna during the performance of [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] included Ariana Grande, Amy Schumer, Nelly Furtado, Anderson Cooper, Graham Norton and Katy Perry, who was called the [...] "Best Unapologetic Bitch Ever" [...] by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{telecast}} {{live by the}} National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{to an audience of}} 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It {{seems to me that there}} are two <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> when listening to any new work. The most important thing is to lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E

Attending the Forest Home college-age conference were Hal Spencer and his sister, Loretta, son and daughter of Tim Spencer, who was a songwriter and publisher of Christian music. Hal and Loretta borrowed the song sheet from Dr. Orr and brought it home and gave it to their father.|$|E

She founded ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, a coalition of 800 global cities, and Cities for Climate Protection with 500 U.S. member cities, to assist urban regions with environmental and global warming policy, respectively.

2500|$|Pentangle {{are often}} characterised as a folk-rock band. Danny Thompson {{preferred}} {{to describe the}} group as a [...] "folk-jazz band." [...] John Renbourn also rejected the [...] "folk-rock" [...] categorisation, saying, [...] "One of the worst <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to a folk song is inflict a rock beat on it[...] [...] Most of the old songs that I have heard have their own internal rhythm. When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer." [...] This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: [...] "Market Song" [...] from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and [...] "Light Flight" [...] from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{expanded to}} include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment {{due in part to}} her YouTube video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of Tropes vs. Women was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that [...] "one of the most radical <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences". [...] "The perpetrators", Sarkeesian went on to say, [...] "do not see themselves as perpetrators at all... They see themselves as noble warriors".|$|E

"Impecuniosity will do you good," [...] Pen's friend said, {{knocking}} out the ashes {{at the end}} of the narration; [...] "I don't know anything more wholesome for a man--for an honest man, mind you--for another, the medicine loses its effect--than a state of tick. It is an alterative and a tonic; it keeps your moral man in a perpetual state of excitement: as a man who is riding at a fence, or has his opponent's single-stick before him, is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face, and braces himself to repulse or overcome it; a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any, and nerves you to grapple with fortune. You will discover what a number of <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without when you have no money to buy them. You won't want new gloves and varnished boots, eau de Cologne and cabs to ride in. You have been bred up as a molly-coddle, Pen, and spoilt by the women. A single man who has health and brains, and can't find a livelihood in the world, doesn't deserve to stay there. Let him pay his last halfpenny and jump over Waterloo Bridge. Let him steal a leg of mutton and be transported and get out of the country--he is not fit to live in it. Dixi; I have spoken. Give us another pull at the pale ale.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now we {{must begin}} to see about furniture," [...] Bob Grimstone said. [...] "The best plan, I think, will be for you two to go round of an evening to all the shops in the neighborhood, and mark off just what you think will suit you. You put down the prices stuck on them, and just what they are, and then the missis can go {{in the morning and}} bargain for them. She will get them five shillings in the pound cheaper than you would. It's {{wonderful}} how women do beat men down, to be sure. When a man hears what's the price of a thing he leaves it or takes it just as he likes, but a woman begins by offering half the sum. Then the chap says no, and she makes as if she was going away; he lets her go a little way and then he hollers after her, and comes down a goodish bit in the price. Then she says she don't particularly want it and shouldn't think of giving any such price as that. Then he tries again, and so they gets on till they hit on a figure as suits them both. You see that little tea-caddy in the corner? My wife was just three weeks buying that caddy. The chap wanted seven and six for it, and she offered him half a crown. He came down half a crown {{at the end of the}} first week, and at last she got it for three and nine. Now, the first thing you have got to do is to make out a list. First of all you have got to put down the things as you must have, and then the <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without, though you will get them if you can afford it. Mother will help you at that." ...|$|E
