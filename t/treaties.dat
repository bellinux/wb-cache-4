5|$|Fellows {{is among}} the {{earliest}} cases where the Supreme Court applied <b>treaties,</b> including <b>treaties</b> between the United States and Native American tribes, as binding law. Fellows has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes, the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into {{the legitimacy of the}} formation of <b>treaties</b> once ratified by the Senate. This doctrine was later used to deny relief (or, to deny more relief) to Native American tribes who claimed that <b>treaties</b> were entered into fraudulently or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe. Fellows was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self-executing and non-self executing <b>treaties.</b> Regardless, <b>treaties</b> between the United States and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self-executing.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities <b>Treaties</b> were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority <b>Treaties</b> were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights <b>treaties.</b>|$|E
