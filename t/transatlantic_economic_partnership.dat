50|$|Economic {{relations}} between Germany and the United States are largely untroubled. The <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership</b> between the U.S. and the EU, which {{was launched in}} 2007 on Germany’s initiative, and the subsequently created Transatlantic Economic Council open up additional opportunities. The U.S. is Germany’s principal trading partner outside the EU and Germany is the U.S.’s most important trading partner in Europe. In terms of the total volume of U.S. bilateral trade (imports and exports), Germany remains in fifth place, behind Canada, China, Mexico and Japan. The U.S. ranks fourth among Germany’s trading partners, after the Netherlands, China and France. At the end of 2013, bilateral trade was worth $162 billion.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, the European Union was established. Relations {{between the}} US and EU were {{defined in the}} New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA), agreed to in 1995. The NTA set forth four broad areas of {{cooperation}} between the US and EU: [...] "promoting peace and stability, democracy and development around the world; responding to global challenges; contributing {{to the expansion of}} world trade and closer economic relations; and building bridges Across the Atlantic." [...] The NTA was further extended to cover bilateral and multilateral trade in 1998, through the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TEP). The Lisbon Treaty, ratified in 2009, established the European External Action Service as the EU's foreign policy institution. Since 2013, the US and EU have been engaged in discussions to create a free trade agreement, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} 50 years, {{progress}} toward multilateral trade liberalization has depended heavily on {{agreement between the}} United States and the European Union. This Policy Brief argues that the current form of transatlantic economic cooperation [...] known as the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership</b> [...] is so limited that it {{runs the risk of}} diminishing this tradition. The follow-on action plan now being negotiated between Washington and Brussels, however, could provide much-needed momentum to the global trading system and should thus be viewed as an opportunity to restore the traditional pattern. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} make an original contribution to knowledge about transatlantic institutions and transatlantic governance. It investigates attempts in the 1990 s to foster a 'new transatlantic dialogue' between the EU and the US, through three bilateral agreements: the Transatlantic Declaration (1990), the New Transatlantic Agenda (1995) and the <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership</b> (1998). The thesis questions whether and to what extent the relationship has been institutionalised into a structure for transatlantic governance, and how the composition of transatlantic institutions impacts the way the transatlantic actors govern. Consideration is given to both 'who' governs in transatlantic relations and 'how', as evidence is sought to prove or disprove the claim that a decentralisation of decision-making powers has resulted in 'policy setting' and 'policy shaping' by lower level civil servants and non-state actors participating in transgovernmental and transnational institutions. Three policy sectors-the EU-US anti-trafficking in women campaigns, the EU-US Mutual Recognition Agreements and the EU-US banana dispute-serve as case studies for the transatlantic policy process...|$|E
40|$|EU–US (European Union–United States) {{interactions}} {{in relation to}} the regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been examined in detail in recent years. To do this scholars have tended to focus on a small number of high profile processes, such as the formal complaint of the US to the World Trade Organisation regarding the regulation of GMOs in the Europe. It is important to analyse developments of this kind but overemphasis on them has also lead to a distorted view of the case and a failure to appreciate the significance of other, less visible, types of interaction. In this paper we focus instead on trying to understand the roles played by various EU–US transnational networks—The Transatlantic Business Dialogue, The <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership,</b> The Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, The Transatlantic Environmental Dialogue and the EU–US Consultative Forum on Biotechnology. These networks have been trying to shape the regulation of GMOs in both jurisdictions since the mid 1990 s. By analysing them through a ‘governance lens’ we find that we can better understand EU–US interactions and the dynamics and influences around the regulation of GMOs. This gives us valuable insights into processes of contemporary governance...|$|E
40|$|Since 1996, the European Union (EU) has {{launched}} several significant initiatives which seek to forge closer economic partnerships with various APEC participants. The 1996 Asia- Europe Meeting (ASEM) initiative {{has now been}} followed by the launch of a new <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Partnership</b> (TEP) to be forged between the EU and the United States. These links will influence the evolution of APEC, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{as well as the}} potential Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). This combination of initiatives could contribute towards the gradual emergence of a global marketplace. On the other hand, since the EU and APEC have adopted very different models of cooperation, these new experiments in inter-regional economic cooperation could also lead to new tensions within existing regional groups. The TEP represents a new approach to the EU’s economic relations {{with the rest of the}} world. It does not propose yet another traditional, preferential ‘free trade area” and deals with issues other than the reduction of border barriers to trade. The proposal also indicates clear awareness of the need for the TEP to co-exist and complement other international economic institutions. This combination of features creates an opportunity to encourage the leaders of both APEC and the EU to adopt some new guiding principles for the nature of new cooperative arrangements among groups of economies. Such principles would seek to ensure that new cooperative arrangements among economies were ‘open clubs’ which took adequate account of the interests of others; these principles can build on and generalise the fundamental principles of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as well as on APEC’s principles of open regionalism, as expressed in the 1995 Osaka Action Agenda. They will also need to be applicable to the full range of international economic transactions, which now extend far beyond trade in goods and services. This paper proposes a set of guiding principles to facilitate closer economic integration among groups of economies are proposed in this paper; under the headings of: WTO-consistency, transparency, non-discrimination, accession and review. ...|$|E

These transgovernmental networks can be considered inevitable in response to the rising significance of non-tariff barriers and in trade liberalization. In case of the EU-US partnership, the cooperation on this level is focused on harmonizing of regulatory measures what is crucial for further integration of the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> relations...|$|R
