The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

Two months later, on 2 July 1613, Captain Samuel Argall of the Colony of Virginia arrived on board the Treasurer and {{destroyed}} their mission.

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mobile battery from Queluz, the pieces were {{arranged}} in the palace gardens so that they could bombard the quarters of the revolutionary sailors, which were located at no more than 100 metres from the palace. However, before they had time to start, the commander of the battery received the order to cancel the bombing and join the forces that were leaving the palace, integrated into the column that would attack the rebels in Artillery 1 and the Rotunda. At around midday the cruisers Adamastor and São Rafael, which had anchored in front of the sailors' quarters an hour previously, started the bombardment of the Palace of Necessidades, an action which served to demoralise the present monarchical forces. The king took refuge in a small house in the palace's park, where he could ring Teixeira de Sousa, since the revolutionaries had only cut the special state telephone lines and not the general network. The king ordered the prime minister to send the battery from Queluz to the palace to impede the debarkation of the sailors, but the prime minister replied that the main action was happening in Rotunda and all the troops <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> were needed. Taking into account that the available troops were not sufficient to defeat the rebels in Rotunda, the minister made it obvious to the king that it would be more convenient to retire to Sintra or Mafra so that the stationed forces of the palace could reinforce the troops in Rotunda.|$|E

Jennet was charged with the murder by {{witchcraft}} of a local landowner, Thomas Lister of Westby Hall, to which she pleaded not guilty. She had already appeared before Bromley in 1611, accused of murdering a child by witchcraft, but had been found not guilty. The most damning evidence given against her was that {{when she had been}} taken to see Lister's body, the corpse [...] "bled fresh bloud presently, in the presence of all <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> present" [...] after she touched it. According to a statement made to Nowell by James Device on 27 April, Jennet had attended the Malkin Tower meeting to seek help with Lister's murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging; her execution took place on 29 July on the Knavesmire, the present site of York Racecourse.|$|E

500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E

Accordingly, when he came to Ctesiphon, he called together in a great plain all the Romans and likewise all the Parthians <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> at the time; then he mounted a lofty platform, and after describing in grandiloquent language what he had accomplished, he appointed Parthamaspates king over the Parthians and set the diadem upon his head."

2500|$|The Badger Trust {{national}} charity, {{believes that}} vaccination {{will also be}} more likely to help eradicate the disease. Referring to further studies by Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA),the group claims that vaccination reduces the risk of unvaccinated badger cubs testing tuberculosis positive, because [...] "by the time cubs emerge and are available for vaccination they might have already been exposed [...] to TB". Steve Clark, a director of the group, has separately said that [...] "vaccination also reduces the bacilli that is excreted by infected badgers. It doesn't cure them, but it reduces the possibility of any further infection...in the region of a 75% level of protection. The life span of a badger is about five years. So if you continue the vaccination project for five years, then the majority of animals <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> at the beginning will have died out and that vaccination programme is leading towards a clean and healthy badger population." ...|$|E

2500|$|Development in {{the area}} began to {{increase}} when the Erie Canal, which connected to the Hudson at the Albany Basin, was completed in 1825. On December 29, 1828 notable residents Israel Smith and Samuel Pruyn, among others, petitioned the Common Council to improve the junction of Clinton and North Pearl streets, an area increasingly visible to visitors to the city. It wasn't until a month later, on January 26, 1829, that the Common Council's committee on the subject reported {{in favor of the}} improvement and recommended that the square be named Clinton Square. It was on August 17, 1829 that the Common Council declared North Pearl Street between Orange Street and Clinton Avenue to be widened and renamed Clinton Square, and the park to be roughly 200 by 60 feet. A small park, it was considered one of the city's major achievements of the time. It was considered the first city improvement north of downtown, the city being focused on the southern section prior to this. The creation of Clinton Square marks the beginning of the district's development and history. By March 1831, however, the opening of the square was denounced as [...] "a monument of the stupidity of its originators" [...] and [...] "had a tendency to reduce rents in that quarter".
