5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> blows up.

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Third, <b>the</b> <b>{{curvature}}</b> index k {{determines the}} sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well.

5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from}} the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. <b>The</b> <b>curvature</b> is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E

5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active volcanism occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day volcanism. These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and <b>the</b> <b>curvature</b> of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish volcanism, as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
