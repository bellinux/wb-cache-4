Carbon fibre-epoxy T-joints were stitched using mendable poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filaments</b> {{to form a}} three-dimensional healing polymer network in the stiffener, web and flange sections.

The stitched network increased the delamination toughness of the T-joint under tension (stiffener pull-off) loading by the <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filaments</b> bridging the fractured sections and thereby generating bridging traction (crack closure) loads. The delamination toughening induced by the mendable stitched network was determined using mode I interlaminar fracture testing. It was discovered that thermal activation of the stitched network resulted in partial repair of delamination and matrix cracks and substantial recoveries (more than 50 %) in the stiffness, ultimate load and energy absorption properties of the fractured T-joint.

40|$|Among Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), more popularly renown as 3 D {{printing}} 1, {{allows the}} fabrication of multimaterial parts by extrusion of multiple <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filaments</b> that are then deposited layer after layer.

Most diffused commercial materials for FDM are Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and the biodegradable PolyLactic Acid (PLA), that are amorphous polymers characterized by similar mechanical properties. The use of semicrystalline polymers in FDM is often avoided because of the higher amount of shrinkage which causes the warpage of the deployed layers during manufacturing. The innovative aspect {{of this paper is}} the use of a filament made of a Polyammide (PA) blend as a reinforcement in multimaterial beams of PLA that are fabricated by FDM. The flexural behaviour of the composite beams is evaluated by three point bending tests according to the ASTM D 790 method.

In this preliminary study, test specimens are 3 D printed with a core of PA having a rectangular cross section, whose width (w) and height (h) are varied.

40|$|In recent years, {{continuous}} fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites {{have been successfully}} employed in the aircraft, military and aerospace industries due to the excellent properties (Brandt et al. 1993 & Nunes et al 2005 a). In these and many other commercial engineering applications, they can replace other materials, such as thermosetting matrix composites. However, {{the high cost of}} the impregnation of {{continuous fibre}} thermoplastic composites, arising from the melting of the polymer or the use of solvents, still restricts their use in commercial applications. Hence, cost reduction largely depends on developing more efficient methods for impregnating fibres with high-viscosity thermoplastics and for processing final composite parts. This chapter summarizes the development of new technologies to fabricate long and continuous fibre reinforced composite structures from thermoplastic matrix semi-products (towpregs and PCT – pre-consolidated tapes) for commercial and highly demanding markets. The production of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix towpregs and PCT’s was done using a recently developed coating line (Nunes et al. 2008, 2010 & Silva, R. F. et al. 2008). Using this prototype equipment, it was possible to produce glass fibre polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) towpregs for commercial markets and towpregs from carbon fibres and Primospire®, an amorphous highly aromatic material developed by Solvay Advanced Polymers, for application in advanced markets (Nunes et al. 2005, 2009 & Silva, J.

40|$|A model {{electrochemical}} {{process for}} synthesizing thick thermoplastic matrix coatings of poly(maleimide(and N-substituted maleimides) -co-styrene) onto conductive graphite fiber reinforcements has been developed. This represents a new route to pre-impregnating graphite fibers with high performance thermoplastic matrices. ^ New and innovative methods of processing thermoplastic composites {{are needed to}} overcome the problem of inadequate wetting of individual graphite fiber strands in a fiber bundle of 3 K or more <b>filaments.</b> <b>Thermoplastic</b> resins possess very high melt viscosity and cannot diffuse uniformly onto the fiber surfaces. The fibers are invariably poorly wetted resulting in poor adhesion between the reinforcement and the matrix. Thermoplastic matrices are also highly solvent resistant and can only dissolve in expensive high boiling solvents. The problems of solvent removal and the inability to wet individual fibers uniformly and the concomitant poor interfacial properties of the resulting graphite fiber-thermoplastic matrix composites underscores the need to invent new processing techniques. In-situ electrocopolymerization of thermoplastic matrices onto graphite fiber reinforcements enjoys the numerous advantages derived from electrochemical polymerization, such as excellent wettability of the fibers, very good control of coating thickness and matrix properties. Electropolymerization is very cost effective and easy to control. By adopting the electrochemical technique to apply advanced thermoplastic matrices directly onto conductive graphite fiber reinforcements, we overcome the major processing {{problems associated with the}} traditional hot melt and solution coating processes. ^ Electrochemical reduction of maleimides and N-substituted maleimides have only resulted in the formation of monomeric succinimide (MW ∼ 200), because of the hydrogenation of the ethylenic bond which terminates chain growth. In the present study electron deficient maleimides were electrochemically copolymerized with electron rich styrene comonomer. The resulting thermoplastic matrices were ideal for composite technology because of their intrinsic high thermal stability, TD ∼ 450 ∘C, and glass transition temperature ∼ 220 - 270 ∘C. The copolymer matrices also are easily and reversibly processable. ^ Aqueous electrocopolymerization of maleimides and styrene ensured a radical chain copolymerization and resulted in high molecular weight resins, Mn ∼ 65, 000. High molecular weight resins are desirable for composite processing because of the associated improved properties. ^ Electrosynthesized prepregs composed of 35 - 65 w/o of resin were compression molded into composite panels. These composites showed excellent impact strength ∼ 220 KJ/m 2, very good flexural strength ∼ 950 - 1700 MPa and moderate shear strength ∼ 60 MPa. ^ In-situ interaction of the thermoplastic matrices with calculated amount of crosslinkable bismaleimide and a multifunctional system such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) respectively, have been attempted.

40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} or 3 D printing have strongly {{been developed}} {{the last years}} and currently propose several solutions. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a layer additive manufacturing process that uses a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filament</b> by fused deposition which builds its geometry along trajectories generated by slicing. This process leads to a locally heterogeneous structure because of the weld lines between the deposed threads. These trajectories (and then the weld lines) are predefined and not necessarily based on the specific mechanical constraints from product’s use. As a consequence, the weld lines can be found oriented in bad directions that reduce the mechanical strength of the printed sample. In this work we used finite elements simulation to identify the principal directions of the stress in a standard Crack Test C-T sample. The aim is to reproduce the principal stress directions inside the internal structure of cracking sample realized in extrusion deposition by 3 D printing {{in order to improve}} the fracture toughness.

The fabrication of functional components brings forward the necessity of the assembly with other components with different properties in term of shape, material and surface quality.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new three-dimensional (3 D) additive manufacturing (AM) technique in which electroactive polymer filament material {{is used to}} build soft active 3 D structures, layer by layer. The proposed manufacturing process is well-suited for creating electroactive soft complex structures and devices, whereby the entire system can be manufactured from an elec-troactive polymer material. For the first time, the unique actu-ation and sensing properties of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) is exploited and directly incorporated into the structural design to create sub-millimeter scale cilia-like actuators and sen-sors to macro-scale soft robotic systems. Because ionic polymers such as Nafion are not melt-processable, in the first step a pre-cursor material (non-acid Nafion precursor resin) is extruded into a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filament</b> for 3 D printing. The filament is then used by a custom-designed 3 D printer to manufacture the desired soft polymer structures, layer by layer.

40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) is {{a generic}} {{term for a}} number of technologies that enable fabrication of physical objects directly from CAD data sources. In contrast to classical methods of manufacturing such as milling and forging which are based on subtractive and formative principles espectively, these processes are based on additive principle for part fabrication. The biggest advantage of RP processes is that an entire 3 -D (three-dimensional) consolidated assembly can be fabricated in a single setup without any tooling or human intervention; further, the part fabrication methodology is independent of the mplexity of the part geometry. Due to several advantages, RP has attracted the considerable attention of manufacturing industries to meet the customer demands for incorporating continuous and rapid changes in manufacturing in shortest possible time and gain edge over competitors. Out of all commercially available RP processes, fused deposition modelling (FDM) uses heated <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>filament</b> which are extruded from the tip of nozzle in a prescribed manner in a temperature controlled environment for building the part through a layer by layer deposition method. Simplicity of operation together with the ability to fabricate parts with locally controlled properties resulted in its wide spread application not only for prototyping but also for making functional parts. However, FDM process has its own demerits related with accuracy, surface finish, strength etc. Hence, it is absolutely necessary to understand the shortcomings of the process and identify the controllable factors for improvement of part quality. In this direction, present study focuses on the improvement of part build methodology by properly controlling the process parameters. The thesis deals with various part quality measures such as improvement in dimensional accuracy, minimization of surface roughness, and improvement in mechanical properties measured in terms of tensile, compressive, flexural, impact strength and sliding wear. The understanding generated in this work not only explain the complex build mechanism but also present in detail the influence of processing parameters such as layer thickness, orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap on studied responses with the help of statistically validated models, microphotographs and non-traditional optimization methods. For improving dimensional accuracy of the part, Taguchi‟s experimental design is adopted and it is found that measured dimension is oversized along the thickness direction and undersized along the length, width and diameter of the hole. It is observed that different factors and interactions control the part dimensions along different directions. Shrinkage of semi molten material extruding out from deposition nozzle is the major cause of part dimension reduction. The oversized dimension is attributed to uneven layer surfaces generation and slicing constraints. For recommending optimal factor setting for improving overall dimension of the part, grey Taguchi method is used. Prediction models based on artificial neural network and fuzzy inference principle are also proposed and compared with Taguchi predictive model. The model based on fuzzy inference system shows better prediction capability in comparison to artificial neural network model. In order to minimize the surface roughness, a process improvement strategy through effective control of process parameters based on central composite design (CCD) is employed. Empirical models relating response and process parameters are developed. The validity of the models is established using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and residual analysis. Experimental results indicate that process parameters and their interactions are different for minimization of roughness in different surfaces. The surface roughness responses along three surfaces are combined into a single response known as multi-response performance index (MPI) using principal component analysis. Bacterial foraging optimisation algorithm (BFOA), a latest evolutionary approach, has been adopted to find out best process parameter setting which maximizes MPI. Assessment of process parameters on mechanical properties viz. tensile, flexural, impact and compressive strength of part fabricated using FDM technology is done using CCD. The effect of each process parameter on mechanical property is analyzed. The major reason for weak strength is attributed to distortion within or between the layers. In actual practice, the parts are subjected to various types of loadings and it is necessary that the fabricated part must withhold more than one type of loading simultaneously. To address this issue, all the studied strengths are combined into a single response known as composite desirability and then optimum parameter setting which will maximize composite desirability is determined using quantum behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). Resistance to wear is an important consideration for enhancing service life of functional parts. Hence, present work also focuses on extensive study to understand the effect of process parameters on the sliding wear of test specimen. The study not only provides insight into complex dependency of wear on process parameters but also develop a statistically validated predictive equation. The equation can be used by the process planner for accurate wear prediction in practice. Finally, comparative evaluation of two swarm based optimization methods such as QPSO and BFOA are also presented. It is shown that BFOA, because of its biologically motivated structure, has better exploration and exploitation ability but require more time for convergence as compared to QPSO. The methodology adopted in this study is quite general and can be used for other related or allied processes, especially in multi input, multi output systems. The proposed study can be used by industries like aerospace, automobile and medical for identifying the process capability and further improvement in FDM process or developing new processes based on similar principle...|$|E
