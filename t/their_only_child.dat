Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to use the money to build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E
30|$|The {{one child}} policy has {{affected}} the world population, the economic development of China and so on in a greatly positive way. But it also might cause some problems. For example, many parents express their concerns that <b>their</b> <b>only</b> <b>children</b> are lonely and are missing out on valuable opportunities for social interaction (Tobin, Wu, & Davidson, 1989). These concerns were reflected in the “ 4 - 2 - 1 syndrome” — four dotting grandparents, two overindulgent parents, all investing their hopes and ambitions on “an emerging generation of spoiled, lazy, selfish, self-centered and overweight children”.|$|R
