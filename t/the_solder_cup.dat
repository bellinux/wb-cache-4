25|$|A preform is a pre-made {{shape of}} solder {{specially}} {{designed for the}} application where {{it is to be}} used. Many methods are used to manufacture <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> preform, stamping being the most common. <b>The</b> <b>solder</b> preform may include <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> flux needed for <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> process. This can be an internal flux, inside <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> preform, or external, with <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> preform coated.|$|R
50|$|To simplify soldering, beginners {{are usually}} advised to apply <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron and <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> {{separately}} to <b>the</b> joint, rather than <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> being applied direcly to the iron. When sufficient <b>solder</b> is applied, <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then {{removed from the}} joint.|$|R
50|$|Modern circuit {{assembly}} {{techniques that}} use reflow soldering {{do not necessarily}} allow <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> to flow more than once. They guarantee that <b>the</b> granulated <b>solder</b> contained in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> paste surpasses <b>the</b> reflow temperature of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> involved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} defect when hand-soldering {{results from the}} parts being joined not {{exceeding}} <b>the</b> <b>solder's</b> liquidus temperature, resulting in a [...] "cold solder" [...] joint. This is usually the result of <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron being used to heat <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt <b>the</b> <b>solder,</b> guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic hand <b>soldering</b> <b>the</b> flux is embedded in <b>the</b> <b>solder.</b> Therefore, heating <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans <b>the</b> surfaces being <b>soldered.</b> A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation. A [...] "dry joint" [...] occurs when <b>the</b> cooling <b>solder</b> is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron {{is removed from the}} joint.|$|R
50|$|In the {{assembly}} of integrated circuit packages to printed circuit boards, a head-in-pillow defect is a failure of <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> process.

A cross-section through the failed joint shows a distinct boundary between <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> ball on <b>the</b> part and <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> paste on <b>the</b> circuit board, rather like a section through a head resting on a pillow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{find out}} the {{important}} factors which decisively affect <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> quality of photovoltaic modules, solar cells were soldered under different conditions (different temperatures, PbSn vs. SnAgCu solder, manual vs. semi-automatic). Experimental results show that <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> quality of PbSn under 350 °C in <b>the</b> semi-automatic <b>soldering</b> process was quite stable while <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> quality of lead-free solder was generally unacceptable in the manual or semi-automatic process under different temperatures. This result indicates that <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> process with lead-free solder {{still needs to be}} further improved. It was also found that most cracks were formed on the interface between <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> and <b>the</b> silver paste and then expanded outwards. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} flux is to {{facilitate}} <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> process. One {{of the obstacles}} to a successful solder joint is an impurity {{at the site of}} the joint, for example, dirt, oil or oxidation. The impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (<b>the</b> <b>solder)</b> encourages <b>the</b> work piece (and <b>the</b> <b>solder)</b> to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> temperatures increase and can completely prevent <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> from joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux was charcoal, which acts as a reducing agent and helps prevent oxidation during <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> process. Some fluxes go beyond the simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning (corrosion).|$|R
50|$|The {{acoustic}} energy created by <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> tip or ultrasonic solder pot works via cavitation of <b>the</b> molten <b>solder</b> which mechanically disrupts oxide layers on <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> layers themselves and on metal surfaces being joined.|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} process yields {{lower levels}} of internal porosity for solder joints produced in reduced-gravity environments. The process incorporates both alternative materials and a modified procedure. The process provides the necessary cleaning action to enable effective bonding of <b>the</b> applied <b>solder</b> alloy with <b>the</b> materials to be joined. The modified process incorporates a commercially available liquid flux that is applied to <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint before heating with <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron. It is subsequently heated with <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron to activate the cleaning action of the flux and to evaporate most of the flux, followed by application of <b>solder</b> alloy in <b>the</b> form of commercially available solid solder wire (containing no flux). Continued heating ensures adequate flow of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> alloy around and onto the materials to be joined. The final step is withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>soldering</b> iron to allow alloy solidification and cooling of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{differences}} in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between the chip and the FR- 4 board generate the shear strains and the bending moment in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint. It seems to be a main cause of failure in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint when <b>the</b> chip and the FR- 4 board are heated repeatedly. Thus, the fatigue loading induced by thermal cycling is a major concern in the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint. <b>The</b> magnitude of shear strain and the final failure are known to be influenced by varying boundary conditions such as the difference of CTE, <b>the</b> height of <b>solder,</b> <b>the</b> distance of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint from <b>the</b> neutral point (DNP) and the temperature variation. In this paper, the effects of boundary conditions on the failure probability of <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joint are studied by using the failure probability models such as the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS).

40|$|Solder joint {{fatigue failure}} is a {{prevalent}} failure mechanism for electronics subjected to thermal cycling loads. The failure {{is attributed to}} the thermo-mechanical stresses in <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> joints caused by differences in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the printed circuit board (PCB), electronic component, and solder. Physics of failure models incorporate the knowledge of a product’s material properties, geometry, life-cycle loading and failure mechanisms to estimate the remaining useful life of the product.
