2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both <b>of</b> these <b>worlds</b> (understanding and appearance), it is <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding that “contains <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense [...] and so too of its laws.” What this means is that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding, also applies to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense as well, because <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense too. So the moral law binds us even in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> appearances.|$|R
50|$|Like Torg, the Masterbook system {{utilized}} two complementary {{forms of}} in-game conflict resolution: a unified dice mechanic, {{which was based}} on a roll of two ten-sided dice, and a game-specific deck of cards (the MasterDeck, similar to the Drama Deck in Torg) that influenced random number generation, character actions, and the game's plot. Masterbook was used for several licensed properties, most notably <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Indiana Jones (1994), <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Necroscope (1995), <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Aden (1996), <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Species (1995), <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tales from <b>the</b> Crypt (1996), and <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tank Girl (1995).

5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> past Final Fantasy games {{most notably in}} the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{has been}} {{renowned for its}} {{elaborate}} story and usage of anime-like cinematic cutscenes.

5|$|Phase II {{would prove}} {{influential}} on The Next Generation, whose creation began just {{over seven years}} later.

It was originally proposed in Gerrold's <b>The</b> <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Star Trek to have the second-in-command leading the away team, and it was anticipated that this would be included in Phase II – it was instead first introduced in The Next Generation.|$|E

The player controls Jason and the tank Sophia the 3rd through eight levels of gameplay to find the whereabouts of Fred and to defeat the mutants and their leader, the Plutonium Boss. The game was praised for its smooth play control and level designs, detailed and clean graphics, and music, and it was criticized for its high difficulty level and lack of passwords or save points.

5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing.

5|$|Early {{during the}} game's development, Nomura already had various scenes in mind such as Terra's and Riku's {{conversation}} {{in order to}} explain the latter's ability in the original games. Various parts from the plot had to be modified to make the game more light-hearted such as Eraqus' death {{at the hands of}} Xehanort after being defeated by Terra, how Aqua's scenario was supposed to end with her already trapped in the Realm of Darkness, and the relationship between Ventus and Sora. Two of the newly introduced protagonists, Ventus and Terra, were based on other characters from the franchise while Aqua's design did not have a base. Nevertheless, the three wear outfits meant to expand the student-and-teacher bond shown in the game. The Disney worlds were chosen to expand the characters of the Princesess of Light as well as Maleficient's who are connected with the events of the first Kingdom Hearts game, while <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> Neverland and Deep Space were chosen to add variety to the game, and Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E

5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> literature and science.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is an action-adventure game {{presented}} in stereoscopic 3D polygonal graphics, with gameplay predominantly experienced from a top-down perspective.

A Link Between Worlds {{is seen as a}} successor to the 1991 Super Nintendo Entertainment System title , and is similar in many aspects. <b>The</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> Hyrule and Lorule in A Link Between Worlds are analogous to A Link to the Pasts depiction of Hyrule and the Dark World.

In the altered (and game's final) story, where there is no Prince, the Queen (appearing in both of her forms) has built a lair {{resembling}} her poisoned apple inside the scary wood, and has put Snow White to eternal sleep in her dungeon and intends to do the same to the Seven Dwarfs. The player needs to correctly mix ingredients for several potions including the True Love Potion to magically summon the Prince and save the day. It is followed by the fight with the Queen where she tries to get away and the player has to reflect her magic ball spells, until she retreats to her lair.
