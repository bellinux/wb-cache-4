Unfortunately, this {{information}} comes after characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded, melted, and so forth and it is mentioned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> transformed into an inanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be alive and presumably conscious.|$|E
500|$|The {{second game}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews, with a reviewer from PC Gamer commenting {{that what he}} had hoped for in the sequel [...] "was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs", and that [...] "what I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety". However, {{he also noted that}} [...] "enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty". Destructoid also gave the game a positive review, saying that [...] "It's absolutely terrifying to know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> attacked at any moment from multiple avenues" [...] and also praised the introduction of new animatronics and mechanics, but also criticizing the jumpscares and calling the game [...] "too hard for its own good".|$|E
500|$|According to MTV's Monique Steele, Kim Possible is [...] "all {{about how}} girls kick butt"; Kim {{constantly}} rescues Ron, saving him from peril {{on numerous occasions}} throughout the series. Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's tired or sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} what you began by complaining of, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> of use? Now, I fancy this would give you the pleasure of undergoing a little personal inconvenience {{for the good of}} another." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gerbic's {{interest}} in paranormal and fringe topics began during childhood, {{when she was}} most frightened by spontaneous human combustion, [...] "the idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{walking down the street}} and suddenly, BOOM!" [...] She grew up in Salinas as a Southern Baptist who became interested in skepticism in the 1990s. [...] "I had never heard the word atheist until I was in my late teens," [...] Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford. [...] "Once I found out there were other people who felt the way I did, I read everything I could on the subject". In 2000, Gerbic discovered that there was a community of skeptics and went to her first conference, Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon a month later. [...] "I felt like I had found my people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! And Lemuel! {{will you}} let Jane {{give you your}} supper in the dining-room, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> here if I heard {{anything}} else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she would}} be heartless {{if she were to}} {{encourage}} you to be with her simply for the assistance you may give her, knowing at the same time <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> happy in her presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{understand}} you," [...] {{he replied}} quietly. [...] "I shall not urge you, for I {{would rather see}} you happy than to be happy myself. I see now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> happy with--an ape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, to a brewer at Winchester! I say not <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>be</b> like poor sister Bridget, {{but only}} that the cloister has no charm to still the heart--prayer and duty can do as much without as within.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{wasted no}} time over it, Colonel O'Connor. You can only have {{received}} the order yesterday morning, and I scarcely expected <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> here till this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would," [...] said I, [...] "you {{could feel}} it--would <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{made to feel}} it." [...] But he never guessed that my heart was wrung for the poor listeners.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just because}} he offered you some shooting, Doctor," [...] Isobel said indignantly. [...] "I thought better of you than to suppose <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> bought over so easily as that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You went to Uglich {{when the}} Tsarevitch Demetrius was slain," [...] said Boris. His voice and mien were calm and normal. [...] "Yourself {{you saw the}} body. There <b>is</b> no {{possibility}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> mistaken in it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{truth is}} that we never thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> caught," [...] he said; [...] "we counted on you as the one red-hot revolutionary left in the world. But, of course, these men like MacIan are awfully clever, {{especially}} when they pretend to be stupid." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Or at my {{saying that}} I really believe I felt, even then, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{faithfully}} affectionate against all discouragement, and never {{cease to be}} so, until you ceased to live?---Will you laugh at such a dream?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} Thorne with {{a certain}} dryness, [...] "we are certainly acquainted. When you use the other term in England it to some extent implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> regarded {{as a friend of}} the person mentioned." ...|$|E

"Yes, Charlie {{has had a}} bad bout of it, Carstairs," [...] Major Jervoise said cheerfully; [...] "but he {{has picked}} up wonderfully {{in the last ten}} days, and, in as many more, I shall look to see him at work again.

6000|$|The despair in {{her face}} nerved him to further speech. [...] "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that you are {{worrying}} about that deed--or rather the loss of it. I am sorry that I came too late, but it couldn't be helped. <b>You</b> did all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could!</b> I <b>am</b> sure of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Your {{father is}} the {{president}} of the company Mr. Northwick had his little embarrassment with, and the natural presumption would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not really <b>be</b> friendly toward his family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my friend; {{and have}} shown yourself, as such, very {{willing to do}} your part. But do you not know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more active and more useful as a clergyman's wife than you can be as a solitary woman?" ...|$|E
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. I fed you and clothed you and housed you. I {{took care}} {{that you should}} have money enough to live handsomely--more than enough; so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> wasteful, careless, generous. That saved your soul from the seven deadly sins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Said I {{not that}} you were good and generous? Said I not <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> noble, Monsieur?" [...] she cried, as she caught his {{resisting}} hand and sought to carry it to her lips. [...] "God will bless you, Monsieur--" ...|$|E
50|$|And {{if a man}} who {{has been}} cut and scarred and is ashamed of his appearance, who loved you from the first time his eyes rested upon your face, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a brutal fool, believing <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made to love all of the things he really was, you would never again recoil from the things he seemed to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know," [...] she said, [...] "my uncle {{declares}} <b>that</b> if only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{taught to}} imbibe {{a little more}} of the real philosophy of living, you would become quite a desirable person." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, boy, {{your mind}} hasn't got quite {{on the balance}} yet. It ain't {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> as fat as a young pig after bein' {{three or four months}} at sea in an open boat. What was the name of your ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a kind}} of notion <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> if {{it suited}} you. I want a man with grit in him, who has had a good education, and could, if it was necessary, mix on equal terms with the folks in the cities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{all very}} well, archdeacon; {{and of course}} you're right; I don't for a moment think you'll ever admit <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> wrong; but the fact is, you've brought this young man down upon papa by huffing him as you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heed them not," [...] he {{answered}} her. [...] "I {{may have been}} something of all <b>that,</b> but <b>you</b> have purified me, Rose.

[...] "I shall walk along the shore towards Trefusis Point to-morrow morning. If you should chance to be similarly disposed...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I almost think she'll have you, and I'm {{not sure}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> need worry {{yourself}} {{too much about}} not being good enough for her. <b>That's</b> a point <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> content with her mother's opinion on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For you, dear Lucille," [...] Lady Carey {{said with}} suave and deadly satire, [...] "what {{improvement}} is possible? <b>You</b> have all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> desire.
