Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop as the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) in Burlington, and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic cameras were added {{to create a new}} traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E

5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery {{was transferred to the}} new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E

Between 28–30 December 1962, an American aircraft equipped with eavesdropping equipment located a Viet Cong radio transmitter. It intercepted radio signals in the hamlet of Ap Tan Thoi in Dinh Tuong Province where the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was headquartered. The radio intercept and other information obtained by Jim Drummond, Vann's intelligence officer, indicated that the Viet Cong were using Ap Tan Thoi as a headquarters location. Furthermore, South Vietnamese and American intelligence personnel believed the Viet Cong had deployed a reinforced company of about 120 men to protect the transmitter. Certain that the Viet Cong unit was no larger than the reported number, the ARVN 7th Infantry Division was instructed to attack Ap Tan Thoi.|$|E

5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E

Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics.

5|$|The most {{successful}} pair {{in the history}} of the Olympic doubles event was Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt, who represented East Germany in 1988 and the reunified German Olympic team from 1992 to 1998, winning four medals: two golds, one silver, and one bronze. East Germany's Hans Rinn and Norbert Hahn, and Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger, are the other pairs to have won two times, both of them in consecutive Olympics. In 1972, two gold medals were awarded to an East German (Horst Hörnlein and Reinhard Bredow) and an Italian pair (Paul Hildgartner and Walter Plaikner), who finished with exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> prevent similar situations in future Olympics, the Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course introduced timing equipment that measured accurately to one thousandth of a second, to replace the old equipment that measured in hundredths of a second.|$|E

Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
