40|$|The {{effect of}} iron oxide on <b>the</b> <b>reduction</b> of MnO with carbon was {{investigated}} in order to study the characteristics of pre-reduction of Mn ores by the gas analysis method.

The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>reduction</b> of <b>the</b> surface oxide on Rh(111) by H- 2 was {{observed}} in situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and high-resolution core level spectroscopy (HRCLS). At room temperature, H- 2 does not adsorb on the oxide, only in reduced areas. Reduction starts in very few sites, almost exclusively in stepped areas.

5|$|Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. The first {{towns to}} be {{concentrated}} into colonial reducciones were Ixtutz, {{which became the}} new town of San José, and neighbouring San Andrés, both {{on the north shore}} of Lake Petén Itzá. They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén. <b>The</b> <b>reductions</b> failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the Itza language.|$|E

5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of <b>the</b> <b>reductions</b> in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands.
