2500|$|A senior {{military}} official said Bales {{had been drinking}} alcohol with two other soldiers {{on the night of}} the shootings, in violation of military rules in combat zones. According to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Bales acknowledged the killings and [...] "told individuals what happened" [...] immediately after being captured. Minutes later he refused to speak with investigators and asked for an attorney. Bales' civilian attorney John Henry Browne, later said, [...] "I don't know that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> prove much. There's no forensic evidence. There's no confession." [...] However, in May 2013, Browne said his client would confess to the massacre in return for avoiding the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 July 2009, Dan Rogerson MP, of the Liberal Democrats, {{presented}} a Cornish 'breakaway' {{bill to the}} Parliament in Westminster – 'The Government of Cornwall Bill'. The bill proposes a devolved Assembly for Cornwall, similar to the Welsh and Scottish setup. The bill states that Cornwall should re-assert its rightful place within the United Kingdom. Rogerson argued that [...] "that there is a political and social will for Cornwall to be recognised as its own nation. Constitutionally, Cornwall {{has the right to}} a level of self-Government. If <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> recognise the right of Scotland and Wales to greater self-determination because of their unique cultural and political positions, then they should recognise ours." ...|$|E

50|$|In June 2010, the Attorney-General Lara Giddings {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to proceed}} with reform, using former Attorney-General Judy Jackson's 2003 draft legislation as a starting point.

6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Sir Robert, I will {{be quite}} frank with you. I want you to {{withdraw}} the report that you had intended to lay before the House, {{on the ground that}} you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something. Then I want you {{to say a few words}} to the effect that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value. You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind. A few ordinary platitudes will do. In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude. It makes the whole world kin. Will you do that for me? ...|$|E
60|$|These returns {{exhibit a}} curious annual {{uniformity}} in results; {{the sort of}} uniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in the world's capitals, and the proportions of deaths by this, that, and the other disease. You can always come close to foretelling how many suicides will occur in Paris, London, and New York, next year, and also how many deaths will result from cancer, consumption, dog-bite, {{falling out of the}} window, getting run over by cabs, etc., if you know the statistics of those matters for the present year. In the same way, with one year's Indian statistics before you, you can guess closely at how many people were killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year, and the year before that, and the year before that, and at how many were killed in each of those years by bears, how many by wolves, and how many by snakes; and you can also guess closely at how many {{people are going to be}} killed each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies. You can also guess closely at how many of each agency <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill each year for the next five years.|$|E
5000|$|In {{preparation}} for Oklahoma's statehood, the Dawes Commission was authorized in 1896 {{to work with}} the Five Civilized Tribes to enroll their members for allotments of tribal land to individual households.

50|$|The court’s {{ruling was}} much broader than just {{abortion}} {{and family planning}} services; if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay for a program, it can attach conditions. Under Rust v. Sullivan, federal funds for family planning programs could promote only childbirth options without being considered discriminatory. Other views, particularly abortion services, could not be admitted within the programs’ narrowly defined scope.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{rights groups}} have raised {{questions}} as to why al-Awlaki was killed by the U.S. {{in a country with}} which the United States was not at war.

5000|$|The Governor-general of the region, En-lin, advised <b>the</b> Imperial <b>government</b> not to {{alienate}} Muslims.

Muslim rebels tried to seize Lingzhou (present-day Lingwu) and Guyuan in several attacks as a result of false rumors spread by some Muslims that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to kill all Muslims.|$|R
5000|$|These three {{processors}} do {{not come}} close to the national output and there has <b>been</b> <b>government</b> interest to revive and open new processing plants.
