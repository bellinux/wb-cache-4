50|$|A <b>tripropellant</b> rocket is {{a rocket}} that uses three propellants, {{as opposed to}} the more common {{bipropellant}} rocket or monopropellant rocket designs, which use two or one fuels, respectively. <b>Tripropellant</b> rockets appear to offer fairly impressive gains for single stage to orbit designs, although to date no <b>tripropellant</b> rocket design has been developed to the point of testing that would prove the concept.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, <b>tripropellant</b> {{vehicles}} {{start off}} burning with dense fuel and transition to hydrogen. (In a sense the Space Shuttle does this with its combination of solid rockets and main engines, but <b>tripropellant</b> vehicles usually carry their engines to orbit.) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tri{{propellant}}</b> rocket—variable propellant mixes {{can improve}} performance ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s Philip Bono {{investigated}} single-stage, VTVL <b>tripropellant</b> rockets, {{and showed}} that it could improve payload size by around 30%.|$|E
50|$|The company {{continues}} {{to research and}} explore new engine concepts, such as the <b>tripropellant,</b> bi-modal engines of the RD-700 family (RD-701 and RD-704).|$|E
50|$|The {{concept was}} first {{explored}} in the US by Robert Salkeld, who published {{the first study}} on the concept in Mixed-Mode Propulsion for the Space Shuttle, Astronautics & Aeronautics August 1971. He studied a number of designs using such engines, both ground based and a number that were air-launched from large jet aircraft. He concluded that <b>tripropellant</b> engines would produce gains of over 100% in payload fraction, reductions of over 65% in propellant volume and better than 20% in dry weight. A second design series studied {{the replacement of the}} Shuttles SRBs with <b>tripropellant</b> based boosters, in which case the engine almost halved the overall weight of the designs. His last full study was on the Orbital Rocket Airplane which used both <b>tripropellant</b> and (in some versions) a plug nozzle, resulting in a spaceship only slightly larger than a Lockheed SR-71, able to operate from traditional runways.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{specific}} impulse for a chemical propellant ever test-fired in a rocket engine was 542 seconds (5,320 m/s) with a <b>tripropellant</b> of lithium, fluorine, and hydrogen. However, this combination is impractical; see rocket fuel.|$|E
50|$|Glushko {{has used}} an {{expanding}} nozzle on one design, the RD-701 <b>tripropellant</b> rocket. Funding ran {{out with the}} fall of the Soviet state, but the designers are convinced the engine has potential and have approached several parties for additional funding.|$|E
50|$|There are two principally {{different}} kinds of <b>tripropellant</b> rockets. One is a rocket engine which mixes three separate streams of propellants. In the 1960s, Rocketdyne fired an engine using a mixture of liquid lithium, gaseous hydrogen, and liquid fluorine to produce a specific impulse of 542 seconds, likely the highest measured such value for a chemical rocket motor.|$|E
50|$|Liquid rockets can be {{monopropellant}} rockets using {{a single}} type of propellant, bipropellant rockets using {{two types of}} propellant, or more exotic <b>tripropellant</b> rockets using three types of propellant.Some designs are throttleable for variable thrust operation and some may be restarted after a previous in-space shutdown. Liquid propellants are also used in hybrid rockets, in which a liquid oxidizer is generally combined with a solid fuel.|$|E
50|$|The {{other kind}} of <b>tripropellant</b> rocket is one that uses one {{oxidizer}} but two fuels, switching between the two in mid-flight. In this way the motor can combine the high thrust of a dense fuel like kerosene early in flight with the high specific impulse of a lighter fuel like liquid hydrogen (LH2) later in flight. The result is a single engine providing some {{of the benefits of}} staging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tripropellant</b> engines {{were built}} in Russia. Kosberg and Glushko {{developed}} a number of experimental engines in 1988 for a SSTO spaceplane called MAKS, but both the engines and MAKS were cancelled in 1991 {{due to a lack}} of funding. Glushko's RD-701 was built and test fired, however, and although there were some problems, Energomash feels that the problems are entirely solvable and that the design does represent one way to reduce launch costs by about 10 times.|$|E
50|$|Liquid rockets {{have been}} built as {{monopropellant}} rockets using a single type of propellant, bipropellant rockets using two types of propellant, or more exotic <b>tripropellant</b> rockets using three types of propellant.Bipropellant liquid rockets generally use a liquid fuel, such as liquid hydrogen or a hydrocarbon fuel such as RP-1, and a liquid oxidizer, such as liquid oxygen. The engine may be a cryogenic rocket engine, where the fuel and oxidizer, such as hydrogen and oxygen, are gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures.|$|E
50|$|RD-701 (Раке́тный дви́гатель 701, Rocket Engine 701) - liquid-fuel {{rocket engine}} {{developed}} by Energomash, Russia. It was proposed to propel the reusable MAKS space plane before cancellation of this project. The RD-701 is a <b>tripropellant</b> engine that uses staged combustion cycle afterburning of oxidizer-rich hot turbine gas. This engine has two modes. Mode #1 uses three components: LOX as an oxidizer and a fuel mixture of RP-1 / LH2 which is applied for near earth surface conditions. Mode #2 also uses LOX, with LH2 as fuel in vacuum where atmospheric influence is negligible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tripropellant</b> rockets designs often {{try to use}} an optimum mix of {{propellants}} {{for launch}} vehicles. These use mainly dense fuel while at low altitude and switch across to hydrogen at higher altitude. Studies by Robert Salkeld in the 1960s proposed SSTO using this technique. The Space Shuttle approximated this by using dense solid rocket boosters {{for the majority of}} the thrust for the first 120 seconds, the main engines, burning a fuel-rich hydrogen and oxygen mixture operate continuously throughout the launch but only provide the majority of thrust at higher altitudes after SRB burnout.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{specific}} impulse chemistry ever test-fired in a rocket engine was lithium and fluorine, with hydrogen added {{to improve the}} exhaust thermodynamics (all propellants had {{to be kept in}} their own tanks, making this a <b>tripropellant).</b> The combination delivered 542 s {{specific impulse}} in a vacuum, equivalent to an exhaust velocity of 5320 m/s. The impracticality of this chemistry highlights why exotic propellants are not actually used: to make all three components liquids, the hydrogen must be kept below -252 °C (just 21 K) and the lithium must be kept above 180 °C (453 K). Lithium and fluorine are both extremely corrosive, lithium ignites on contact with air, fluorine ignites on contact with most fuels, including hydrogen. Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which makes working around the launch pad difficult, damages the environment, and makes getting a launch license that much more difficult. Both lithium and fluorine are expensive compared to most rocket propellants. This combination has therefore never flown.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tripropellant</b> engines on earth-to-orbit {{vehicles}} is examined {{in terms of}} their impact on engine configurations and launch capabilities. Hydrocarbon fuel with some oxygen is used in <b>tripropellant</b> fuels, with hydrogen as a back-up fluid for coolant and driving the pumps. Engine concepts which implement <b>tripropellant</b> fuels include a hydrogen-gas generator engine with staged combustion, a two-mode engine burning hydrocarbon fuel in one chamber and hydrogen in another, a dual expander engine with a central hydrocarbon nozzle and an annular hydrogen nozzle, and a dual throat engine. The use of hydrocarbons reduces the fuel weight by providing a higher specific impulse than with LOX-LH 2 systems alone. Studies have shown that single-stage-to-orbit vehicles capable of lifting 13. 6 Mg are possible with <b>tripropellant</b> engines. A dual-expander engine, is identified as offering the most fuel dry mass reduction for a given payload if cooling requirements can be satisfied. Further development of the <b>tripropellant</b> engines is concluded to be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} under MSFC contract NAS 8 - 39210 to compare <b>tripropellant</b> and bipropellant engine configurations for the SSTO mission. The objective was to produce an 'apples-to-apples' comparison to isolate the effects of design implementation, designing company, year of design, or technologies included from the basic tripropellant/bipropellant comparison. Consequently, identical technologies were included (e. g., jet pumps) and the same design groundrules and practices were used. Engine power cycles were examined as were turbomachinery/preburner arrangements for each cycle. The bipropellant approach and two <b>tripropellant</b> approaches were separately optimized in terms of operating parameters: exit pressures, mixture ratios, thrust splits, etc. This briefing {{presents the results of}} the study including engine weights for both <b>tripropellant</b> and bipropellant engines; dry vehicle weight performance for a range of engine chamber pressures; discusses the basis for the results; examines vehicle performance due to engine cycles and the margin characteristics of various cycles; and identifies technologies with significant payoffs for this application...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the specific-impulse advantages of adding metals to conventional liquid-bipropellant systems. These <b>tripropellant</b> systems theoretically offer higher specific impulse and increased propellant density compared with bipropellant systems. Metals considered were Be, Li, and Al. Bipropellant systems were H 2 /O 2, N 2 H 4 /N 2 O 4, RP- 1 /O 2, and H 2 /F 2. Thermochemical calculations were performed for sea-level expansion from 6. 895 -MN/sq. m. (1000 -psia) chamber pressure over a wide range of mixture ratios and propellant compositions. Three-dimensional plots characterize the specific impulse of each <b>tripropellant</b> system. Technology issues pertinent to metallized propellant systems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Alternate Propulsion Subsystem Concepts {{contract}} {{had seven}} tasks defined that are reported under this contract deliverable. The tasks were: FAA Restart Study, J- 2 S Restart Study, Propulsion Database Development. SSME Upper Stage Use. CERs for Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines. Advanced Low Cost Engines, and <b>Tripropellant</b> Comparison Study. The two restart studies, F- 1 A and J- 2 S, generated program plans for restarting production of each engine. Special emphasis {{was placed on}} determining changes to individual parts due to obsolete materials, changes in OSHA and environmental concerns, new processes available, and any configuration changes to the engines. The Propulsion Database Development task developed a database structure and format which is easy to use and modify while also being comprehensive in the level of detail available. The database structure included extensive engine information and allows for parametric data generation for conceptual engine concepts. The SSME Upper Stage Use task examined the changes needed or desirable to use the SSME as an upper stage engine both in a second stage and in a translunar injection stage. The CERs for Liquid Engines task developed qualitative parametric cost estimating relationships at the engine and major subassembly level for estimating development and production costs of chemical propulsion liquid rocket engines. The Advanced Low Cost Engines task examined propulsion systems for SSTO applications including engine concept definition, mission analysis. trade studies. operating point selection, turbomachinery alternatives, life cycle cost, weight definition. and point design conceptual drawings and component design. The task concentrated on bipropellant engines, but also examined <b>tripropellant</b> engines. The <b>Tripropellant</b> Comparison Study task provided an unambiguous comparison among various <b>tripropellant</b> implementation approaches and cycle choices, and then compared them to similarly designed bipropellant engines in the SSTO mission This volume overviews each of the tasks giving its objectives, main results. and conclusions. More detailed Final Task Reports are available on each individual task...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect on performance and temperatures of the addition of either liquid hydrogen or liquid ammonia to three bipropellant systems of current interest. These bipropellant systems are nitrogen tetroxide-hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide-hydrazine, and RFNA-hiydrazine. For each <b>tripropellant</b> system all important parameters and chamber and exhaust temperatures are determined for equilibrium flow conditions and constant composition flow conditions. All the results are listed in tables and the effects on several of the more important parameters are illustrated graphically. The results show that theoretically the effect of the addition of the third component is desirable by causing reduction in temperature and increase in performance. New parameters are introduced for utilization in predicting performances of <b>tripropellant</b> systems once the chamber temperature has been calculated or estimated...|$|E
40|$|Engine design, performance, {{weight and}} {{envelope}} data were established for three mixed-mode orbit-transfer vehicle engine candidates. Engine concepts evaluated are the <b>tripropellant,</b> dual-expander and plug cluster. Oxygen, RP- 1 and hydrogen are the propellants considered {{for use in}} these engines. Theoretical performance and propellant properties were established for bipropellant and <b>tripropellant</b> mixes of these propellants. RP- 1, hydrogen and oxygen were evaluated as coolants and the maximum attainable chamber pressures were determined for each engine concept within {{the constraints of the}} propellant properties and the low cycle thermal fatigue (300 cycles) requirement. The baseline engine design and component operating characteristics are determined at a thrust level of 88, 964 N (20, 000 lbs) and a thrust split of 0. 5. The parametric data is generated over ranges of thrust and thrust split of 66. 7 to 400 kN (15 to 90 klb) and 0. 4 to 0. 8, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study was performed that identified and characterized promising chemical propulsion system designs that utilize {{two or more}} of the propellant combinations: LOX/H 2, LOX/CH 4 and LOX/CO. The engine systems examined focused on the usage of common subsystem/component hardware where feasible. From the evaluation baseline employed, <b>tripropellant</b> MTV LOX cooled and bipropellant LEV and MEV engine systems are identified...|$|E
40|$|A <b>tripropellant,</b> such as GO 2 /H 2 /RP- 1, CFD {{design code}} has been {{developed}} to predict the local mixing of multiple propellant streams as they are injected into a rocket motor. The code utilizes real fluid properties {{to account for the}} mixing and finite-rate combustion processes which occur near an injector faceplate, thus the analysis serves as a multi-phase homogeneous spray combustion model. Proper accounting of the combustion allows accurate gas-side temperature predictions which are essential for accurate wall heating analyses. The complex secondary flows which are predicted to occur near a faceplate cannot be quantitatively predicted by less accurate methodology. Test cases have been simulated to describe an axisymmetric <b>tripropellant</b> coaxial injector and a 3 -dimensional RP- 1 /LO 2 impinger injector system. The analysis has been shown to realistically describe such injector combustion flowfields. The code is also valuable to design meaningful future experiments by determining the critical location and type of measurements needed...|$|E
40|$|Several current {{rocket engine}} {{concepts}} such as the bell-annular <b>tripropellant</b> engine, and the linear aerospike being proposed for the X- 33, require unconventional three-dimensional rocket nozzles which must conform to rectangular or sector-shaped envelopes to meet integration constraints. These types of nozzles exist outside the current experience database, therefore, development of efficient design methods for these propulsion concepts {{is critical to the}} success of launch vehicle programs. Several approaches for optimizing rocket nozzles, including streamline tracing techniques, and the coupling of CFD analysis to optimization algorithms are described. The relative strengths and weaknesses of four classes of optimization algorithms are discussed: Gradient based methods, genetic algorithms, simplex methods, and surface response methods. Additionally, a streamline tracing technique, which provides a very computationally efficient means of defining a three-dimensional contour, is discussed. The performance of the various optimization methods on thrust optimization problems for <b>tripropellant</b> and aerospike concepts is assessed and recommendations are made for future development efforts...|$|E
40|$|The design {{concept for}} a LOX/hydrocarbon <b>tripropellant</b> booster engines is discussed. The engine design {{is for the}} gas {{generator}} cycle with liquid methane, liquid oxygen, and liquid hydrogen as propellants, the latter greatly reducing risks associated with the high-pressure reusable hydrocarbon booster engines. The design features high combustion stability and high efficiency. The excellent cooling capability of liquid hydrogen was established in several operational engine designs. Multiple design diagrams are included...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} year NASA and DLR {{computer}} codes were combined in order to analyze and optimize advanced rocket launcher systems. Previous optimization results led to relatively low chamber pressures and nozzle area ratios for the different cycles. Additional effort {{has been made to}} improve the verification of propulsive parameters such as chamber pressure, nozzle extension, kind of cycle, <b>tripropellant</b> systems, variable mixture ratio rocket motors, new technology effects, etc. The emphasis {{of this paper is to}} describe the methodology of the improved propulsion mass model...|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} of a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLLV) several engines with different operating cycles and using LOX/Hydrocarbon propellants are presently being examined. Some concepts utilize hydrogen for thrust chamber wall cooling followed by a gas generator turbine drive cycle with subsequent dumping of H 2 /O 2 combustion products into the nozzle downstream of the throat. In the Space Transportation Booster Engine (STBE) selection process the specific impulse {{will be one of the}} optimization criteria; however, the current performance prediction programs do not have the capability to include a third propellant in this process, nor to account for the effect of dumping the gas-generator product tangentially inside the nozzle. The purpose is to describe a computer program for accurately predicting the performance of such an engine. The code consists of two modules; one for the inviscid performance, and the other for the viscous loss. For the first module, the two-dimensional kinetics program (TDK) was modified to account for <b>tripropellant</b> chemistry, and for the effect of tangential slot injection. For the viscous loss, the Mass Addition Boundary Layer program (MABL) was modified to include the effects of the boundary layer-shear layer interaction, and <b>tripropellant</b> chemistry. Calculations were made for a real engine and compared with available data...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} {{is to determine the}} effect on the temperatures and the performance parameters of the addition of (1), liquid hydrogen, and (2), liquid ammonia to three bipropellant systems currently of interest. These bipropellant systems are: nitrogen tetroxide-hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide-hydrazine, and RFNA-hydrazine. For each of the six tripropeliant systems investigated the chamber temperature, exhaust temperature, and all the important parameters were calculated. These calculations for each system were carried out for both equilibrium flow and constant composition flow assumptions. All the results are listed in tables and the more important parameters are presented in graphical form as well. One hydrogen containing system and one ammonia containing system are discussed in detail. General results for all systems include the fact that the largest proportionate decreases are observed in the variation of the exhaust and chamber temperatures whereas the specific impulse shows slight increases or proportionate decreases of much smaller magnitude than the proportionate decreases in temperatures. Several new parameters are introduced {{in an effort to make}} possible the prediction of performances of a <b>tripropellant</b> system if the chamber temperature variation is known. These parameters may also be used in an indirect manner to illustrate the relative merit of liquid hydrogen and liquid ammonia as coolants in <b>tripropellant</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Two {{years ago}} NASA and DLR {{computer}} codes were combined {{in order to}} analyse and optimize advanced rocket launcher systems. During the past year further effort has been made on this combined code concerniconcerning influences induced by the propulsive parameter such as chamber pressure, kind of cycle for the rocket motor and therefore by the required preburner pressure, mixed cycle, <b>tripropellant</b> cycle, nozzle extension, two-position nozzle effects etc. The emphasis of this work is to describe the performance part of the propulsion model and to apply the revised code on the optimization of single stage advanced shuttles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The GO 2 /ethanol/water <b>tripropellant</b> {{evaporation}} and combustion in axisymmetric {{combustion chamber}} was numerically simulated. The different {{characteristics of the}} evaporation and combustion between dilative and traditional un-dilative entrance, and the different dilation-angles of the combustion chamber entrance are analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} dilative entrance combustion chamber is benefit for thermal protection of the injection, and the flamelet backpedals with increase of the entrance dilation-angle. At the same time, that dilative inlet combustion chamber reduces the evaporation of the liquid component seriously. The evaporation rate decreases with the increase of the dilation-angle at first, but after the dilation-angle is bigger than a critical one, it increases...|$|E
40|$|A {{propulsion}} system {{analysis of a}} dual fuel, dual throat engine for launch vehicle application was conducted. Basic dual throat engine characterization data are presented to allow vehicle optimization studies to be conducted. A preliminary baseline engine system was defined. Dual throat engine performance, envelope, and weight parametric data were generated over the parametric range of thrust from 890 to 8896 KN (200 K to 2 M lb-force), chamber pressure from 6. 89 million to 34. 5 million N/sq m (1000 to 5000 psia) thrust ratio from 1. 2 to 5, {{and a range of}} mixture ratios for the two <b>tripropellant</b> combinations: LO 2 /RP- 1 + LH 2 and LO 2 /LCH 4 + LH 2. The results of the study indicate that the dual fuel dual throat engine is a viable single stage to orbit candidate...|$|E
40|$|In 1988 {{computer}} codes from NASA and DLR {{were combined}} {{to analyze and}} optimize rocket engines for advance launch vehicles. Further effort has addressed performance propulsion parameters such as chamber pressure, cycle selection (including mixed and <b>tripropellant</b> cycles), nozzle extension, and new technologies. Results of the study indicate that lower dry masses can be reached with the staged combustion cycle than with the gas-generator cycle, using oxygen/hydrogen at relatively high mixture ratio (7 : 1) and modest chamber pressure (220 bar). For low dry masses the staged combustion cycle is only excelled by the dual-expander cycle using hydrogen and propane as fuels. The emphasis here is to explain the procedure and boundary conditions used for the analysis and the variety of configurations treated, {{as well as to}} demonstrate the methods used by presenting some of the major results...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 A {{reusable}} VTVL (vertical take-off, vertical landing), all-rocket SSTO (single-stage-to-orbit) {{launch vehicle}} is proposed {{to reduce the}} cost of space transportation. The concept vehicle is based on presently-existing or near-term technology, and incorporates several features to improve performance, including all-composite construction, lightweight pressure-stabilized tankage, and the use of a HIAD (hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator) - an inflatable heatshield - to return from orbit. Several different types of main engines, consuming various fuels, are considered. An ad-hoc MATLAB code is used to predict the empty mass of the vehicle, quantify the sensitivity of the design to empty mass growth, and the system life-cycle cost. A vehicle powered by <b>tripropellant</b> engines based on RD- 701 /RD- 704 technology consuming liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and methane fuels is identified as the best performer...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept was}} {{evaluated}} with cold flow (nitrogen gas) testing and through analysis for application as a <b>tripropellant</b> engine for single-stage-to-orbit type missions. Three {{modes of operation}} were tested and analyzed: (1) Mode 1 Series Burn, (2) Mode 1 Parallel Burn, and (3) Mode 2. Primary {{emphasis was placed on}} the Mode 2 plume attachment aerodynamics and performance. The conclusions from the test data analysis are as follows: (1) the concept is aerodynamically feasible, (2) the performance loss is as low as 0. 5 percent, (3) the loss is minimized by an optimum nozzle spacing corresponding to an AF-ATS ratio of about 1. 5 or an Le/Rtp ratio of 3. 0 for the dual throat hardware tested, requiring only 4 % bleed flow, (4) the Mode 1 and Mode 2 geometry requirements are compatible and pose no significant design problems...|$|E
