5|$|Even {{when this}} inner planet, {{with a mass}} at least 78% times that of Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a drift in its radial velocity. This eventually led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the outer planet 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{earliest}} historical records of Copenhagen {{are from the}} end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020.

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey.

His work led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills.

5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine.
