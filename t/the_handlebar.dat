5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on <b>the</b> <b>handlebar,</b> it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b> If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

25|$|A cyclocomputer or cyclometer is {{a device}} {{mounted on a}} bicycle that calculates and {{displays}} trip information, similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car. The computer with display, or head unit, usually is attached to <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> for easy viewing. In 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the cyclometer.|$|E
500|$|Some {{off-road}} models featured two {{designs of}} one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as [...] "Mission Control" [...] (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material. The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a [...] threaded steerer. MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, {{and a special}} eight pointed wrench was required to remove it. The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust {{the height of the}} stem. MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> was not welded.|$|E
500|$|The driver {{sits in a}} {{recumbent}} {{position in}} an open cockpit, steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees. A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b> As a supplement to or replacement for electric power, the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located {{at the front of}} the cockpit. The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is [...] At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres (1 cu ft). As the C5 does not have a reverse gear, reversing direction is done by getting out, picking up the front end and turning it around by hand.|$|E

500|$|Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr {{nonetheless}} still {{favor the}} Roper, even by Cameron's criterion. The reason, they say, {{is that it}} did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies, including the twistgrip throttle control, and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle {{as we know it}} today, while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude, failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork, and turn by leaning. Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees, rather than perfectly vertical, and by having the steering axis slightly offset, creating trail. This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive, and typically unconscious, technique of countersteering, in which <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> is turned slightly to the left, causing the machine to lean to the right, and turning the vehicle to the right. Trail, also called fork offset, is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics, and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down, so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle. David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed [...] "a crude makeshift", saying, [...] "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867â€“1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E

2500|$|Bumpy surfaces: If {{the front}} wheel comes off the ground during braking, it will stop completely. [...] Landing on a stopped front wheel with the brakes still applied is likely to cause {{the front wheel}} to skid and may flip the rider over <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mounting {{requires}} skill. The rider {{must first}} grasp <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> and place {{one foot on}} a peg above the back wheel. Then the rider scoots the bicycle forward to gain momentum and quickly jumps up onto the seat while continuing to steer the bicycle and maintain balance.|$|E
2500|$|Rim brakes are {{so called}} because braking {{force is applied}} by {{friction}} pads to {{the rim of the}} rotating wheel, thus slowing it and the bicycle. [...] Brake pads can be made of leather, rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal [...] "shoes". Rim brakes are typically actuated by a lever mounted on <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because wheel flop {{involves}} the lowering {{of the front}} end of a bicycle or motorcycle, the force due to gravity will tend to cause handlebar rotation to continue with increasing rotational velocity and without additional rider input on <b>the</b> <b>handlebars.</b> [...] Once <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> are turned, <b>the</b> rider needs to apply torque to <b>the</b> <b>handlebars</b> to bring them back to the straight ahead position and bring {{the front end of}} the bicycle or motorcycle back up to the original height. [...] The rotational inertia of the front wheel will lessen the severity of the wheel flop effect because it results in opposing torque being required to initiate or accelerate changing the direction of the front wheel.|$|R

This lowering phenomenon occurs according to the following equation: ...|$|R
2500|$|Invented in 1897, {{the duck}} brake or duck roller brake used a rod {{operated}} by a lever on <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. [...] Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set {{at an angle to}} conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. [...] A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. [...] Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind <b>the</b> <b>handlebar,</b> which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). [...] Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. [...] Known colloquially as the duck brake, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. [...] In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on <b>the</b> <b>handlebar</b> to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Triathlon- or time-trial-specific frames {{rotate the}} rider forward around {{the axis of}} the bottom bracket of the bicycle as {{compared}} to the standard road bicycle frame. [...] This is in order to put the rider in an even lower, more aerodynamic position. [...] While handling and stability is reduced, these bicycles are designed to be ridden in environments with less group riding aspects. [...] These frames tend to have steep seat-tube angles and low head tubes, and shorter wheelbase for the correct reach from the saddle to <b>the</b> <b>handlebar.</b> [...] Additionally, since they are not governed by the UCI, some triathlon bicycles, such as the Zipp 2001, Cheetah and Softride, have non-traditional frame layouts, which can produce better aerodynamics.|$|E

60|$|After this {{whirlwind}} Mr. Hoopdriver {{paid his}} reckoning and--being now a little rested about {{the muscles of}} the knees--resumed his saddle and rode on in the direction of Ripley, along an excellent but undulating road. He was pleased to find his command over his machine already sensibly increased. He set himself little exercises as he went along and performed them with variable success. There was, for instance, steering in between a couple of stones, say a foot apart, a deed of little difficulty as far as the front wheel is concerned. But the back wheel, not being under the sway of the human eye, is apt to take a vicious jump over the obstacle, which sends a violent concussion all along the spine to the skull, and will even jerk a loosely fastened hat over the eyes, and so lead to much confusion. And again, there was taking the hand or hands off <b>the</b> <b>handlebar,</b> a thing simple in itself, but complex in its consequences. This particularly was a feat Mr. Hoopdriver desired to do, for several divergent reasons; but at present it simply led to convulsive balancings and novel and inelegant modes of dismounting.|$|E
