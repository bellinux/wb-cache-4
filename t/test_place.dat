5|$|He {{was unable}} to reclaim his <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> in 195253 despite making 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests. Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 {{dismissals}} in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match. His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane, making fun of the mistakes made by Tallon's replacement Gil Langley in particular.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1958, nearing his 37th birthday, Lindwall stepped up his bid to reclaim his <b>Test</b> <b>place.</b> He {{committed}} him to an intense fitness program that included a 5km daily run followed by vigorous exercises to increase his abdominal and back strength. He set up equipment in his garage. Lindwall was determined to add to his Test tally of 212 wickets, which was just four behind the Australian record of Clarrie Grimmett. He was unmoved by a 6000-pound offer from an English newspaper to cover the 1958–59 Ashes series as a journalist, instead wanting {{to play in the}} series.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff {{was hoping}} to regain his <b>Test</b> <b>place,</b> and started his 1962–63 {{campaign}} in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. After Victoria made 174, the paceman took 4/65 to dismiss South Australia for 141 in the first innings. In the second innings he took 3/76 to help seal a win. He continued his early season form in taking match figures of 7/179 against Western Australia, {{but was unable to}} prevent defeat. Despite these performances, Meckiff was overlooked for the First Test. He had another chance to vie for national selection when Victoria played England after the opening Test, and took match figures of 4/90 as the tourists completed a five-wicket victory. He dismissed Ray Illingworth, Geoff Pullar and Alan Smith as Victoria took a four-run first innings lead, but the hosts collapsed in their second innings and Dexter's men reached their target of 180 with five wickets in hand.|$|E

5|$|Having {{missed a}} season due to {{national}} service and university studies, Craig returned to first-class cricket in 1955–56, earning {{a place in}} the 1956 Ashes touring squad. Craig regained a Test position for the final two Tests of the series. After the series, at which point Australia had suffered three consecutive Ashes series defeats, captain Ian Johnson and vice-captain Keith Miller retired. The selectors focussed on young players to rebuild the team, appointing Craig as the captain for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa, although he had played just six Tests and was not an established member of the team. Aged 22years and 194days, Craig was, at the time, the youngest captain in Test history and led a team that critics dismissed as having no chance to a convincing 3–0 victory; his own batting form was poor, and he averaged less than 20. He contracted hepatitis {{before the start of the}} 1958–59 season and withdrew from cricket. Although he returned the following season for New South Wales, he could not regain his <b>Test</b> <b>place.</b> He retired from first-class cricket at the age of just 26: work commitments as a pharmacist increasingly restricted his ability to train. In later life, Craig was the managing director of the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots. He had a continued involvement with cricket as an administrator, working with the New South Wales Cricket Association, the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and the Bradman Museum. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his service to cricket.|$|E
5|$|Loxton had an {{unproductive}} {{time during the}} 1950–51 Australian season. He lost his <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> after three matches, and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62. In the first match of the season, he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown's touring team, a portent of the coming season. However, he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests, scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3/24 against New South Wales. The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm that completely {{changed the nature of}} the pitch after the first day. The Australian all-rounder had by then been the victim of a spectacular catch by England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, making 24 in Australia's 228. He picked up five catches—his first Test catches in his tenth match—as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen, who made 7/68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface. Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings, unable to cope with the conditions, as did most of his compatriots. Australia collapsed to 3/0 before reaching 7/32, at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting. England fell to 6/30 at stumps in pursuit of 193. Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours, while only 102 runs had been scored. Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs.|$|E
25|$|Healy {{maintained}} his <b>Test</b> <b>place,</b> beginning {{the season with}} scores of 68 at Brisbane and 85 at Perth against New Zealand.

25|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England brought David Sheppard in to replace Parkhouse {{for the fourth}} Test, and a {{combination}} of limited opportunity and unimpressive scores meant {{that he did not}} reclaim a <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> until, on the New Zealand leg of the tour, an injury crisis brought him back to the side for the second of the two-match series. In a low-scoring match, he made 2 and 20.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the first}} two Tests, England lost two of their three World Series Cup matches, and two fifty over matches against the Australian Cricket Academy, but won a four-day match against Queensland with Gatting scoring a double-hundred to secure his <b>Test</b> <b>place.</b> The break also saw Dennis Lillie commenting {{critically}} {{about the state of}} the pitches, concerned that they were deliberately being produced to favour spin.|$|E

He returned to play in the deciding third Test at Cape Town and bowled well, taking six wickets for 88 runs in the match as South Africa clinched the match and the series.

25|$|His form in England {{assured him}} of a <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> {{in the next few}} games. After scoring a pair against Australia in the Kanpur Test, Sharma scored his first Test hundred in the very next match. He could have scored another in the next Test at Calcutta, but with 3.4 overs still left {{before the end of the}} Test, he appealed against light. Through the 1979–80 season, Sharma played a series of steady but unexceptional innings where he often played a {{supportive}} role to a senior batsman. He was basically a defensive batsman but could hit very hard when needed.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} of his career, Burge was scoring {{consistently}} enough to command a regular <b>Test</b> <b>place.</b> On the 195758 tour of South Africa, he made 111 not out against a South African XI in a warm-up for the Tests, and then made 80 in the next match against Border. He was selected in the First Test in Johannesburg. After scoring a duck and 14 in a drawn match, it was Burge who was dropped when vice-captain Neil Harvey returned from injury as Australia took the five-Test series 30. Burge scored only one further fifty in the tour matches and ended with 441 runs at 49.00.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall had {{an unusual}} style, quite {{different}} from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> for most of his career. Tattersall held his index finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence: just as {{its early}} {{performance}} history {{is far from}} clear, so too is {{the date of the}} play's composition. 1598 can be fixed as a terminus post quem, as Shakespeare definitely used George Chapman's Seven Books of the Illiad of Homer as a source, which was entered into the Stationers' Register in April 1598. Some scholars have attempted to link the play to the War of the Theatres, particularly the reference to the [...] "Prologue armed" [...] (l.23), which may be an allusion to the prologue in Jonson's The Poetaster (1601), in which an obviously infuriated Jonson lashes out at his detractors. However, the prologue in Troilus was not included in either Q or Q, making it difficult to directly connect it to the squabbles between the playwrights. Stylistic evidence is also inconclusive. A rare word <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it closest to Hamlet. Ants Oras' pause <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it after Henry IV and before Othello, but is unable to determine exactly where the play lies between the two. A colloquialism-in-verse <b>test</b> <b>places</b> it after Hamlet and before Twelfth Night. Metrical analysis places it after Hamlet and Twelfth Night but before Measure for Measure and Othello. This all suggests a date of composition of somewhere between 1600 and 1602, but the exact order in which Hamlet, Twelfth Night and Troilus and Cressida were written seems impossible to determine.|$|R
25|$|In 1954 Close scored {{his first}} {{first-class}} century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring Pakistanis. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against South Africa, {{and at the}} end of the season was only 3wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the West Indies, but did not perform well enough to secure a regular <b>Test</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E

During 2008 and 2009, he was a more infrequent member of the England teams– however he reclaimed his <b>Test</b> <b>place</b> during the 2009 Ashes, which England won, and featured in several ODIs the following year. During 2010, he captained Warwickshire to victory in the CB40 final before scoring his first Ashes century the following winter as he helped England retain the Ashes down-under. Warwickshire County Cricket Club awarded Bell a benefit in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{sluggish}} Adelaide pitch {{had been}} rendered even more toothless by its new wicket, the fresh soil removing its tendency to take spin {{after the second}} day. With five fast bowlers in the touring team there were bouncers aplenty as they vied for a <b>Test</b> <b>place,</b> which slowed down the over-rate to 10 or 11 an hour. Mike Hendrick did best with his 5/68 in the second innings and Derek Underwood took 7/127 in the match with his carefully placed spin. By coincidence the South Australian wicketkeeper was Mike Hendricks and he made 57 in the home side's first innings. The South Australian captain Ian Chappell top-scored with 78 in the second despite hooking early and often, {{but in the end}} the over-rate and flat pitch ensured a draw.|$|E
