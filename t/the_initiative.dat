5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of <b>the</b> <b>Initiative</b> tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh.

Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{constitutes a}} reflection on two initiatives seeking to reconfigure maternity care. One initiative sought to digitalise maternity records and included a pilot run of an electronic maternity record in a Danish county. The other consisted of a collaboration between a maternity ward at a hospital {{and a group of}} researchers which included me. Both initiatives involved numerous seemingly different interests that were held together and related to reconfiguring maternity care. None of <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> can unequivocally be labelled a success, as neither managed to change maternity care, {{at least not in the}} intended manner. It was, however, an achievement to relate the different interests for a period. In this dissertation I will elucidate the proposed changes in <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> as well as expound on the manner in which they were proposed. It is argued that the different interests involved in <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> were not obstacles which the proposed changes should overcome, but are on the contrary necessary, as it is the alliances between the particular interests and the proposed changes that motor <b>the</b> <b>initiatives.</b> <b>The</b> interests were not invented through <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> but are forme...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{changes are}} a natural {{phenomenon}} {{but the current}} issue is that the changes are happening more rapidly {{and as a result}} of human pollution. Bangladesh is experiencing many challenges as a result of climate changes and these challenges has great consequences such as the destruction of homes, fields and entire cities. The economy of Bangladesh is very dependent on the agricultural sector which creates even more issues when agriculture is compromised by climate changes. The consequences of climate change that Bangladesh is experiencing has made the issue an often discussed political topic. This has resulted in the establishment of different initiatives which are made to help Bangladesh cope with the challenges of climate change. In this project <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> in <b>the</b> Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) is being analysed in theory and their effect on the the sustainable livelihood is discussed. The main objective of the project is to look at the influence the BCCSAP has on the sustainability of livelihoods and the vulnerability of the population of Bangladesh. To narrow down the area of study only two out of six themes of initiatives has been chosen for the analysis and discussion. Three theories has been chosen to ensure the quality of the analysis and to analyse the BCCSAP according to the sustainable livelihoods of the population of Bangladesh. The analysis shows that some initiatives has been favored compared to others, but besides this notification <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> seemed adequate for improving the sustainable livelihood of the population. <b>The</b> BCCSAP <b>initiatives</b> should lead to a strengthening of the population, as well as a lessening of vulnerability, which makes <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> usable for <b>the</b> future. Even though <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> seemed to work in theory, several imperfections was discovered when looking at <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> in practice. Here it was discovered that only a very small part of the population, decided how <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> should be. This small part of the population who was involved were also not necessarily the ones with the most knowledge on the topic. As a consequence of this, some of <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> implemented have not been very useful in reality and has not taking into consideration how the general inhabitants of Bangladesh live their lives and what they might need to improve their livelihood. It is also <b>the</b> same <b>initiatives</b> which has been implemented across the country even though the different areas might have different specific needs. Furthermore most of <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> are long termed which means that the immediate help needed by the population is not provided. We have therefore concluded that <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> presented in <b>the</b> BCCSAP are functional in theory but that the reality of <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> has not become the expected success...|$|R

Based on this, the peak shaving reserve mechanism was designed to probe into the countermeasures against the coal-electricity price conflicts. The study revealed that in the boom seasons of coal demand, <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> of <b>the</b> coal enterprises to supply thermal coal and the electricity enterprises to order thermal coal are reduced under conditions of double price regulations. However, under the circumstances of coal price marketization, in the boom seasons of coal demand the thermal coal price may go up obviously, <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> of <b>the</b> coal enterprises to supply thermal coal are increased, and meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> of <b>the</b> power enterprises to order thermal coal are decreased dramatically. The transportation capacity constraint of coal supply leads to the evident decrease of <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> of coal enterprises for the thermal coal supply. The mechanism of peak shaving reserve of thermal coal may not only reduce the price of coal market but also increase the enthusiasm of the power enterprises to order more thermal coal and <b>the</b> <b>initiatives</b> of <b>the</b> coal enterprises to supply more thermal coal...|$|R
