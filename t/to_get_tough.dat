25|$|Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again is a non-fiction book by Donald Trump. It {{was first}} {{published}} in hardcover format by Regnery Publishing in 2011. It was reissued under the new title Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again! by the same publisher in 2015, to match Trump's 2016 election campaign slogan. Trump had previously published The America We Deserve (2000) as preparation for his attempt to run in the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign with a populist platform. Time <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Tough</b> in contrast served as his prelude to the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, with a conservative platform.|$|E

40|$|Polymers are {{materials}} of large {{use in the}} various sectors of the world economy. The use of polymeric materials in daily life, instead of the classic materials has increased in recent decades. However, for certain structural applications polymers need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>tougher.</b> One of the principal toughening techniques based on physical mixture {{of two or more}} components, forming the so-called polymer blends. The addition of rubber or not vulcanized in polymer compositions is reported in the literature as a means of generating mixtures of easy processing, and economically advantageous to increase the toughness of the thermoplastic matrix of interest. Moreover, it can be an alternative for the recycling of waste tires and footwear coming from industries, as well reduce harmful effects on the environment. Therefore, the present study aims to present a review of the definitions, benefits, thermodynamic fundamentals and toughening polymers. </p...|$|R
50|$|Mannix is {{a driving}} force behind the effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>tougher</b> {{sentences}} for criminals. In 1994, he authored Ballot Measure 11, which established mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes, including murder, manslaughter, serious assault, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration, sexual abuse, and robbery. This measure has also now been used to set automatic sentencing on accidental deaths due to addiction issues. A companion measure, Measure 10, also passed, amending the Oregon Constitution to provide that any criminal sentence established by a vote of the people cannot be reduced by the Legislature except with a two-thirds vote of both houses. A third successful Mannix measure, Measure 17, amended the Oregon Constitution to establish a new section which requires that state prison inmates work full-time in useful work. This also allowed work time to include education courses, counseling, and job training.|$|R

60|$|We consented gladly, and, {{mounting}} our horses, set {{off at a}} swinging gallop {{after the}} capatas and his men. We soon came to a small herd of cattle; the capatas dashed after them, and, unloosening the coils of his lasso, flung the noose dexterously over the horns of a fat heifer he had singled out, then started homewards at a tremendous pace. The cow, urged forward by the men, who rode close behind, and pricked it with their knives, rushed on, bellowing with rage and pain, trying to overtake the capatas, who kept {{just out of reach}} of its horns; and in this way we quickly reached the house. One of the men now flung his lasso and caught the beast's hind leg; pulled in two opposite directions, it quickly came to a standstill; the other men, now dismounting, first ham-strung, then ran a long knife into its throat. Without removing the hide, the carcass was immediately cut up, and the choice pieces flung on to a great fire of wood, which one of the men had been making. In an hour's time we all sat down to a feast of carne con cuero, or meat roasted in the hide, juicy, tender, and exquisitely flavoured. I must tell the English reader who is accustomed to eat meat and game which has been kept till it is tender, that before the tender stage is reached it has been permitted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>tough.</b> Meat, game included, is never so tender or deliciously flavoured as when cooked and eaten immediately after it is killed.

This article argues that the rise and mainstreaming of far right parties has done {{the same for the}} other side and reinforced the trend. This change in the political opportunity structure was not simply seized upon but in part engineered by a centre-right willing to rely on former pariahs for legislative majorities. By adopting some of the far right's themes, it legitimised them and increased both their salience and the seats it brought into an expanded right bloc. Once in office, the centre-right has demonstrated its commitment <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>tough</b> on immigration, crime and welfare abuse, not least to distract from a somewhat surprising turn toward market liberalism.
