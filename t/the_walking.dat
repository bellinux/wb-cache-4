40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{exoskeleton}} called the Unmanned Technology Research Centre Exoskeleton (UTRCEXO), which utilizes a shadow <b>walking</b> assistance mechanism. <b>The</b> shadow <b>walking</b> assistance mechanism shadows <b>the</b> operator’s <b>walking</b> after visible movements by the operator, {{such as a}} heel-off event or a toe-off event. The UTRCEXO determines <b>the</b> operator’s <b>walking</b> intention with <b>the</b> toe-off event, when the toe leaves the ground, and then shadows <b>the</b> operator’s <b>walking.</b> <b>The</b> UTRCEXO implementing <b>the</b> shadow <b>walking</b> assistance mechanism shadows {{the first step of}} the operator immediately...|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} above, {{it can be}} concluded that the mixture-type I and mixture-type II walking modes are better than the ant type and crab type in the aspect of the force distribution and stability. Furthermore, it can be obtained that <b>the</b> mixture-type II <b>walking</b> mode is <b>the</b> best and should be preferentially employed for the heavy-duty six-legged robot with <b>the</b> consideration of <b>walking</b> speed. Actually, <b>the</b> reasonable <b>walking</b> mode can be used based on the practical requirements of the heavy-duty six-legged robot, and {{it can be concluded}} that <b>the</b> maximum <b>walking</b> speed of robot is easily achieved by <b>the</b> ant-type <b>walking</b> mode. <b>The</b> limited space can be traversed using <b>the</b> crab-type <b>walking</b> mode. <b>The</b> force distribution and stability can be easily realized using <b>the</b> mixture-type I <b>walking</b> mode and mixture-type II walking mode.|$|R

5|$|During his lifetime, Rodin was {{compared}} to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized {{as the most important}} sculptor of the modern era, and {{has been the subject of}} much scholarly work. The sense of incompletion offered by some of his sculpture, such as <b>The</b> <b>Walking</b> Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presented}} {{not only the}} difference of <b>the</b> marginal <b>walking</b> time by passenger, but also the derivation of the bus service determination model by passenger attributes. <b>The</b> marginal <b>walking</b> distance to bus stop is a basic parameter to estimate bus service coverage area in certain area. And <b>the</b> marginal <b>walking</b> distance could be transformed from <b>the</b> marginal <b>walking</b> time, which {{is the focus of}} this paper. The result of analysis revealed that the age and income of passenger are strongly related to <b>the</b> marginal <b>walking</b> time. <b>The</b> model suggested in this paper help for the planner to choose optimal alternative in planning or regulating the spacing of bus routes or bus stops in certain area,...|$|R

5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them {{the essence of}} his artistic statement.

Notable examples are <b>The</b> <b>Walking</b> Man, Meditation without Arms, and Iris, Messenger of the Gods.|$|E
