Therefore, a specific design for the housing is shown, which is also adaptable to other conditions. It has been experimentally shown {{that it is important}} <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> the sensor <b>flush</b> with the surface. In addition, the experimental results are discussed. If a membrane-based thermal flow sensor is not <b>mounted</b> <b>flush</b> with the surface, vortices can occur (depending on velocity and fluid properties) or the reduction in the channel cross section plus a decrease in sensitivity have to be taken into account...|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, the U.S. Army drafted final {{specifications}} for a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), {{which was to}} replace all the tactical vehicles in the 1/4 to 1 1/4-ton range, namely the M151 quarter-ton jeep and M561 Gama Goat, as one [...] "jack-of-all-trades" [...] light tactical vehicle to perform the role of several existing trucks. The specification called for excellent on and off-road performance, the ability to carry a large payload, and improved survivability against indirect fire. Compared to the jeep, it was larger and had a much wider track, with a 16 in ground clearance, double that of most sport-utility vehicles. The new truck was to climb a 60 percent incline and traverse a 40 percent slope. The air intake was <b>to</b> be <b>mounted</b> <b>flush</b> {{on top of the}} right fender (or to be raised on a stovepipe to roof level to ford 5 ft of water and electronics waterproofed to drive through 2.5 ft of water were specified.

This is accomplished by using numerical solutions of the direct (the variation of the wall shear stress with time is given) and the inverse problem (the variation of mass transfer rate with time is given).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the set-up of a measurement system for onboard pressure measurements on a Kaplan runner blade of a 9. 3 MW prototype situated at Porjus, Sweden. Piezo-resistive pressure transducers will be <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> on both the pressure- and suctionside of the blade. The hydraulic excitation frequencies will thus be determined and coupled with measurements of the natural frequencies of the machine and the electromagnetic excitation force acting on rotor of the generator. Instrumentation of a prototype is a delicate work. Therefore, the set-up of the measurement system must be carefully prepared in advance. The emphasis of the paper lies on the development of a method <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> the sensors on the blade that allows damaged sensors to be replaced without dismantling the runner blade. In conclusion, possible drawbacks are discussed. Godkänd; 2007; 20071030 (cervante...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 21, 2002 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Joint Advanced Missile Instrumentation (JAMI) {{program is}} {{integrating}} Global Positioning System (GPS) technology into missile telemetry systems. The weakest link {{appears to be}} the GPS antenna. The antenna on a missile is required <b>to</b> be <b>flush</b> <b>mounted</b> for aerodynamic reasons. Due to the missile’s tendency to roll, the antenna needs to be a multi-element omnidirectional antenna array. Therefore an antenna used on missiles is a wrap-around antenna since it will meet the <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> and rolling requirements by giving omnidirectional coverage. JAMI has used readily available techniques for designing wrap-around telemetry antennas to develop a GPS wrap-around antenna and has discovered a major problem. The Phase Center of a wrap-around antenna tends to be a surface, not a point, and not necessarily at the centerline of the missile body. GPS measurements have been conducted to determine the Phase Center of the antenna. When the Phase Center is large, the GPS receiver perceives it as multipath and integer ambiguities cannot be resolved. This paper addresses the problems that have been uncovered and outlines the steps that are planned to resolve them...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} how small, localized disturbances evolves and spreads in a {{laminar boundary layer}} has been made. Two different types of disturbance generators were used. The first consisted of circular latex membranes <b>mounted</b> <b>flush</b> with {{the surface of a}} flat plate. The membranes were used in single or double configuration in order to generate the different desired disturbances. The disturbances in the flow was generated by letting the membranes deflect in or out of the wall for a short time. The second type of disturbance generator was a narrow slot of lenght comparable to the diameter of the membranes, also <b>mounted</b> <b>flush</b> with the flat plate. The slot could be rotated 360 degrees to allow for different types of disturbanes. The disturbances from this type of generator was created by sucking or blowing a short pulse of air through the slot. The development of the disturbances downstrea...|$|R

40|$|Research, design, and {{experimentation}} were {{performed in the}} Gas Dynamics and Turbulence Laboratory at The Ohio State University to control far-field noise for high-speed jets and observe the effects of control {{with the purpose of}} noise mitigation. Recently localized arc filament plasma actuators (LAFPA) were developed to force an axisymmetric Mach 0. 9 jet. Previous experimentation was improved upon by adding four actuators to an eight actuator equally spaced setup. A new nozzle extension was designed to house these twelve actuators and an adaptor was developed <b>to</b> provide <b>flush</b> <b>mounting</b> of the electrodes of the actuators between the nozzle and extension. The twelve actuators were used to excite the flow over a large frequency range, which was expressed in terms of the non-dimension forcing Strouhal number (StDF).
