The steam engine or water wheel would be linked to a series of beams – known as [...] "rods" [...] – [...] fastened together and reaching {{to the bottom of the}} mineshaft. [...] These were arranged to offer a reciprocating motion of, typically, twelve to fifteen feet (three to five metres). Small foot platforms were attached to the rods at the same distance apart as the engine stroke and fixed platforms were built onto the shaft walls, spaced to coincide with the top and bottom positions of each of the moving platforms. The moving platforms were often small, typically [...] square, to make the miner stand close to the centre-line of the rod and thus keep a safe distance from the sides of the shaft. For the same reason, grab handles were fitted directly above each one. To go up or down, the miner would step onto the <b>travelling</b> <b>platform</b> and allow himself to be carried to the next fixed platform, where he would step off and wait. At the end of the next stroke the next moving platform would line up and he could step onto it and repeat the process. [...] Miners could ascend and descend at the same time: the pause at the changeover point was made long enough for two men to change places. Counterweights – large boxes filled with stones attached through [...] "see-sawing" [...] horizontal beams – were installed to avoid the full weight of the shaft and men bearing on the top linkage. In the deepest mines, which could sink to more than 350fathoms (640metres), extra counterweights were provided at regular intervals, in horizontal side galleries.|$|E

50|$|QF Mark II was {{a single}} gun {{mounting}} (Mounting Mk 1) anti-aircraft gun in static sites. The pedestal mount was bolted to concrete in an unarmoured turret, a <b>travelling</b> <b>platform</b> was available to transport the gun and mounting between positions. The first unit became operational in February 1939. These 16.5 ton anti-aircraft mountings had a maximum elevation angle of 80 degrees. However, most mountings were Mark 1A with an elevation range of -9.5 to 80 degrees. This enabled the gun to be dual role (anti-aircraft and coastal defence) in coastal areas. Armour piercing rounds were provided for anti-ship engagements.|$|E

The mounting had a pedestal that was fixed to a solidly constructed, preferably concrete, platform on the ground. In 1944, it was found that a temporary platform built from railway sleepers and rails was adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy without the cost and delay of constructing new concrete platforms. These were known as Pyle platforms, after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General Frederick Alfred Pile.|$|E

40|$|A 3 {{degree of}} freedom (dof) {{parallel}} Delta robot {{was built in the}} laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Canterbury. It possesses the similar characteristics and features as Clavel’s Delta 4 robot, which is well known for pick and place applications. Due to its parallel actuated mechanisms, this type of robot, so far, has been claimed as the fastest robot in the world. However, the Canterbury Delta robot in the laboratory suffered jerky motions when travelling along a prescribed continuous path. This was due to the use of 3 single axis step motor controllers (donated) rather than a single multi-axes control system. In order to improve the performance of the robot, the 3 existing control systems were replaced by a single chip DSP controller (TMS 320 F 240). Under control of this powerful controller, the robot is able to perform point-to-point motion and continuous path motion under an open loop control mode. In order to use the Delta robot as a walking machine, a tripod foot was successfully developed and attached to the <b>travelling</b> <b>platform</b> of the delta robot. The result was a practical walking machine with 3 dof called Delta walker or Delta walking machine. It is based on parallel mechanisms and has a maximum allowable step length of 120 mm. The step length and walking space of the Delta walking machine were studied and stimulated through a static forces analysis in Matlab 1. It was found that the step length was constrained by the torque limit of the harmonic gear drives rather than the torque output by the stepping motors. An off-line optimal continuous path planning method was developed in Matlab for real time control at the joint level. The step walking path is approximated by a set of location nodes selected on the desired path. The motion control of the machine is provided by trajectory interpolation at the joint level. The pulse rates and the direction values are generated and sent to the DSP through an RS 232 serial communication port...|$|E

We have defined an Internet-based ”multimodal <b>travel</b> <b>platform</b> ” that provides in-formation and services able to support new types of connected transport applications. The considered sce-nario is centered on multimodal travelers (both drivers and passengers). In this paper, we present the SM 4 T 1 simulator, that we have designed and implemented to test the platform and to interact with it on behalf of multimodal travelers. SM 4 T is a fully agent-based simu-lator for multimodal travelers mobility.

40|$|The EC-funded project Instant Mobility is {{defining}} a comprehensive architecture for transport and mobility applications that aim to innovate by introducing future Internet technologies to this domain. A set of core enabling technologies {{are being developed}} by other projects in the Future Internet PPP such as FI-WARE, while the transport domain Instant Mobility project will use these generic enablers where available, and will develop its own enablers where necessary. In this paper, we describe an Internet-based “multimodal <b>travel</b> <b>platform</b> ” that provides information and services able to support new types of connected transport applications. The considered scenario, a “Personal Travel Companion”, is centred on multimodal travellers (both drivers and passengers). Almost all modes of transport are present in this scenario: private car, public transport modes, car sharing, ride sharing, bikes, etc. The project defines requirements for future Internet technology tools and enablers that can support services available to any Internet-connected traveller, whether using a portable, vehicle-based or fixed terminal. Future Internet technologies offer new horizons for transport information systems and propose for travellers a new experience with means of transport. We are designing and implementing a prototype for multimodal travel assistance taking advantage of these technologies. A demonstration of the application is planned in the ITS world congress-Vienna 2012, while the final prototype is due on March 2013.
