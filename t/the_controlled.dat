40|$|Introduction. Macroscopic {{analysis}} {{makes it}} possible to consider <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> process as a whole and go from casual to regular for studies of complex systems and processes. The transition to a qualitatively new level of analysis involves the dynamic models use. In this case it is possible to set <b>the</b> required <b>control</b> time, laws to reduce the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, <b>the</b> relationship between the main parameters of <b>the</b> process <b>control.</b> Problem statement. Entropy is the objective characteristic of <b>control</b> precision. <b>The</b> collection of previously collected data on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, disturbances and other factors form the original information. Working information is extracted in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process. <b>The</b> required amount of information to reduce <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy it enables to consider the process of radio <b>control</b> in <b>the</b> dynamics. <b>The</b> radio <b>control</b> dynamic model (<b>the</b> dynamic equation), which reveals the laws of change of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy in conditions of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information absence and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information availability necessary to make. It should take into consideration that <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information amount reaches a certain limit value. The model should give the opportunity {{to take into account the}} basic radio characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object channel. Theoretical results. A dynamic model which takes into account the relationship between the rate of change of control object entropy and the amount of information that goes on <b>the</b> <b>control</b> channel was proposed. The constant rate of object entropy increase in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> absence and <b>the</b> constant rate of object entropy decrease in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> organization were considered. Restrictions on the potentially possible entropy values and the information amount were included. The steady state situation was analyzed. The time during which <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process can be accomplished was established. The requirement to the relation between the entropy potential value and the quantity of information was determined. The relation between the relative error of <b>the</b> radio <b>control,</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and the starting information was established. Conclusion. The results make it possible to determine the pattern of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy change, both in terms of receipt control information, and if it is the reduction in a contingency situation. On the basis of the entropy analysis procedures set a limit on <b>the</b> relative radio <b>control</b> errors, required time and the maximum value of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy. Hourly and the entropy limit for <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> process take account <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> channel characteristics, channel bandwidth, signal power, noise power, and the relative error of control. ?? ????????? ????????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ????????? ?? ?????? ??????????. ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????. ??????????? ?????, ?? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???? ????????. ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????, ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????????. ?? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ??????????????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????, ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ????...|$|R

The player chooses the gender and customizes the appearance of the main character of the story prior to the start of the game and typically controls them. The main character is joined by up to seven other characters, which are controlled via artificial intelligence; the player may switch which character they are controlling at any time. The other characters move in relation to <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> character according to the formation and level of aggression towards enemies chosen by the player.

Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. Salmon {{was the most important}} fish to Willamette River tribes {{as well as to the}} Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught steelhead and salmon, often by building weirs across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great wooden lodges, practiced slavery, and had a well-defined caste system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially camas).|$|E
5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight.
