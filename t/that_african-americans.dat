40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the literature on African-American men and the psychotherapeutic process as a coping style. It describes the demographics of African-American men in treatment, reasons for seeking treatment, and common issues being presented in the psychotherapeutic session. Research suggesting <b>that</b> <b>African-American</b> men underutilize mental health services is presented, along with more recent research which suggests <b>that</b> <b>African-American</b> men do seek treatment for work-related issues and depression. Many of these issues are related to unconscious conflicts concerning passivity and aggression, and <b>that</b> many <b>African-American</b> men reported racism to be a causative factor in the development of their problems. It is hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>African-American</b> men enter treatment as a result of the impact of a racist society and/or to develop more effective coping mechanisms. This paper explore...|$|R

25|$|The Cockstock Incident was a {{major factor}} in the passage of the first black {{exclusion}} law. It centered on a fight between a Wasco Native American man, Cockstock, and a free black man, James D. Saules, over ownership of a horse. The argument escalated into a melee that killed three men, and led to rhetoric among white settlers <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> could create an uprising among local Native American tribes against settlers.|$|E

Sandford ruling which declared <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> whether enslaved or free, were property {{and could not be}} American citizens.

25|$|Judge Callahan did {{not rule}} that {{excluding}} people by race was constitutional, only that the defense had not proven <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> had been deliberately excluded. By letting Leibowitz go on record on this issue, Judge Callahan provided grounds for the case to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second time. It {{was the basis for}} the court's finding in Norris v. Alabama (1935), that an exclusion of African-American grand jurors had occurred, violating the due process clause of the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|With Saulsbury as governor, the Democratic Party took {{full control}} in Delaware. Under Saulsburyâ€™s leadership, {{this was a}} party that bitterly detested {{virtually}} anything associated with the Republican policies of the federal government, particularly its actions to end slavery and to expand the rights of African-Americans. Strongly opposed to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Saulsbury and the Democrats took every possible step to frustrate their implementation and deny the new rights given to African-Americans. This included the recommendation <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> convicted of certain crimes be sold back into slavery. This fear-mongering was so successful that no Republicans were elected to the Delaware General Assembly in 1868, and hardly any were elected for many years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In 1779, as a {{practical}} solution to end slavery, Jefferson supported gradual emancipation, training, and colonization of African-American slaves rather than unconditional manumission, believing that releasing unprepared slaves {{with no place to}} go and no means to support themselves would only bring them misfortune. In 1784, Jefferson proposed federal legislation banning slavery in the New Territories of the North and South after 1800, which failed to pass Congress by one vote. In his Notes on the State of Virginia, published in 1785, Jefferson expressed the beliefs that slavery corrupted both masters and slaves alike, supported colonization of freed slaves, suspected <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> were inferior in intelligence, and that emancipating large numbers of slaves made slave uprisings more likely. In 1794 and 1796, Jefferson manumitted by deed two of his male slaves; they had been trained and were qualified to hold employment.|$|E

25|$|In July 2007, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) {{released}} a report presenting {{the results of a}} study concerning credit-based insurance scores in automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers. The report was disputed by representatives of the Consumer Federation of America, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.|$|E

ESPN received emails suggesting that Lin was subjected to racial mockery in a manner <b>that</b> <b>African-Americans</b> are not. Ben & Jerry's created a frozen yogurt in honor of Lin named [...] "Taste the Lin-Sanity". It contained lychee honey swirls and fortune cookie pieces.
