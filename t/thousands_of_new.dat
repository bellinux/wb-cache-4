The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level. During Ravalomanana's first term, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, and tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.|$|E

Much of the interior, though, remained inhabited by the Native American tribes and was left unsettled.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Grand Forks {{was chosen}} as the site for an Air Force base. Grand Forks Air Force Base brought <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> jobs and {{residents}} to the community. The military base and the University of North Dakota became integral to the city's economy. With construction of federal highways, during the postwar years residential and business development became suburbanized, spreading to new areas as land was available. Interstate 29 was built on the western side of the city, and two enclosed shopping malls – South Forks Plaza and Columbia Mall – were built on the south side.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously, Sihanouk {{ordered the}} arrest of Chinese {{middlemen}} involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating the conservatives. Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance the conservatives. The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> recruits {{into the arms of}} the hard-line maquis of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the Khmers rouges ("Red Khmers")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{church building}} in the town is Orrick Chapel, built between 1866 and 1869 {{as the home of}} an African Methodist Episcopal congregation. Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations; they attracted hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> members.

50|$|According to an International Bulletin of Missionary Research survey {{conducted}} in 2008, Korean churches send {{out over a}} <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> foreign missionaries every year which presents one of the rapid growing national missionary movements around the world.

In 1990 there were 87 countries receiving Korean missionary service which was more than tripled comparing to a decade before. This number almost doubled again in 2006 in which Korean missionary were serving in 168 countries worldwide.|$|R

5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E
