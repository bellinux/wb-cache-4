25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} square threads {{is that they}} have a much higher intrinsic efficiency than trapezoidal threads (Acme or metric trapezoidal). Due to the lack of a <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> there is no radial pressure, or bursting pressure, on the nut. This also increases the nut life.|$|E
25|$|The {{trapezoidal}} {{metric thread}} form {{is similar to}} the Acme thread form, except the <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. While metric screw threads are more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads for triangular thread forms, the imperially sized Acme threads predominate in the trapezoidal thread form. In some cases customers prefer Acme threads for power screws regardless of metric standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|E
25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29° <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> with {{a thread}} height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer tool life) than is a square thread. The tooth shape also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the screw can carry a greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E
25|$|Twists or Torsade, threads made of {{multiple}} strands of metal twisted together are also sometimes used, some of which, such as Soutache, sometimes have different colored metals or colored non-metal threads twisted together. These are either couched like passing, with the couching thread visible, {{or with the}} <b>thread</b> <b>angled</b> with the twist to make it invisible.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{use of a}} Whitworth pitch {{nowadays}} is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" [...] Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" [...] Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with [...] "thread adapters" [...] to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4" [...] UNC bolts fit 1/4" [...] BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different <b>thread</b> <b>angles</b> of 60° and 55° respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E
50|$|The <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> is the {{included}} angle, measured at a section {{parallel to the}} axis, between the two bearing faces of the thread. The angle between the axial load force and the normal to the bearing surface is approximately equal to half the <b>thread</b> <b>angle,</b> so the <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> has a great effect on the friction and efficiency of a screw, {{as well as the}} wear rate and the strength. The greater the <b>thread</b> <b>angle,</b> the greater the angle between the load vector and the surface normal, so the larger the normal force between the threads required to support a given load. Therefore, increasing the <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> increases the friction and wear of a screw.|$|E
50|$|Acme threads have a 29° <b>thread</b> <b>angle,</b> {{which is}} easier to machine than square threads. They are not as {{efficient}} as square threads, due to the increased friction induced by the <b>thread</b> <b>angle.</b> ACME Threads are generally also stronger than square threads due to their trapezoidal thread profile, which provides greater load-bearing capabilities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When rolling {{thread shaft}} in cross wedge rolling, forming quality of thread is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the <b>thread</b> helix <b>angle,</b> which is a special and complex parameter. However, there is few study {{of the effect of}} the <b>thread</b> helix <b>angle</b> on <b>thread</b> shaft forming. In this paper how <b>thread</b> helix <b>angle</b> affects axial metal flow was analyzed from the perspective of rolling force and the forming process of thread shaft was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The rolling thread segment can be ensured in the middle of rolled pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|R

50|$|The outward facing angled thread bearing surface, when {{acted on}} by the load force, also applies a radial (outward) force to the nut, causing tensile stress.

40|$|Automatic {{methods of}} calculating canvas thread counts from x-rays of {{paintings}} reveal a systematic pattern for {{warp and weft}} thread densities that persists along the respective thread directions. These patterns {{can be used to}} find paintings that have matching weave patterns, with warp-thread pattern matches more prevalent than weft-thread matches when trying to associate paintings to the same canvas. Exploring the commercial priming process provides a way to interpret canvas matches found from thread counting: when can two paintings that express weave matches be declared to come from the same roll? In addition, the automatic technique must take into account the variations in <b>thread</b> <b>angles</b> to extract the thread count. The resulting angle maps readily indicate the presence of weak and strong cusping. The weft-thread angle map in particular provides additional insights into the canvas weaving process and can be used to elaborate weave matches...|$|R
40|$|We {{detail the}} {{application}} of bounding volume hierarchies to accelerate second-virial evaluations for arbitrary complex particles interacting through hard and soft finite-range potentials. This procedure, based {{on the construction of}} neighbour lists through the combined use of recursive atom-decomposition techniques and binary overlap search schemes, is shown to scale sub-logarithmically with particle resolution in the case of molecular systems with high aspect ratios. Its implementation within an efficient numerical and theoretical framework based on classical density functional theory enables us to investigate the cholesteric self-assembly {{of a wide range of}} experimentally-relevant particle models. We illustrate the method through the determination of the cholesteric behaviour of hard, structurally-resolved twisted cuboids, and report quantitative evidence of the long-predicted phase handedness inversion with increasing particle <b>thread</b> <b>angles</b> near the phenomenological threshold value of 45 ^∘. Our results further highlight the complex relationship between microscopic structure and helical twisting power in such model systems, which may be attributed to subtle geometric variations of their chiral excluded-volume manifold...|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason for}} {{adopting}} 26 tpi, is brass tube has a relatively similar wall thickness {{irrespective of the}} outside diameter of the tube, therefore as BSW thread depths {{are determined by the}} threads per inch, a lower tpi would reduce the strength of the tube or cut right through it. Brass tube threads can be confused with the British Standard Cycle thread, one of which that is most common is also 26 tpi.

40|$|Quantitative canvas weave {{analysis}} has many applications in art investigations of paintings, including dating, forensics, and canvas rollmate identification. Traditionally, canvas analysis {{is based on}} X-radiographs. Prior to serving as a painting canvas, a piece of fabric is coated with a priming agent; smoothing its surface makes this layer thicker between and thinner {{right on top of}} weave threads. These variations affect the X-ray absorption, making the weave pattern stand out in X-ray images of the finished painting. To characterize this pattern, it is customary to visually inspect small areas within the X-radiograph and count the number of horizontal and vertical weave threads; averages of these then estimate the overall canvas weave density. The tedium of this process typically limits its practice to just a few sample regions of the canvas. In addition, it does not capture more subtle information beyond weave density, such as <b>thread</b> <b>angles</b> or variations in the weave pattern. Signal processing techniques applied to art investigation are now increasingly used to develop computer-assisted canvas weave analysis tools...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of ceramic spinnerets offer several benefits {{in contrast to}} {{the state of the art}} metal-spinnerets, such as a higher endurance as well as the simplification or even avoidance of a chemical cleaning process.

40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as thread pitch, <b>thread</b> geometry, helix <b>angle,</b> <b>thread</b> depth and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, thread pitch, <b>thread</b> geometry, helix <b>angle,</b> <b>thread</b> depth, thread width and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased thread pitch may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.

The Thury thread form had the crests rounded at 1/6p and the roots rounded at 1/5p so the <b>thread</b> <b>angle</b> was close to 47.5 degrees but not exactly.

40|$|In {{examining}} paintings, {{art historians}} use {{a wide variety}} of physico-chemical methods to determine, for example, the paints, the ground (canvas primer) and any underdrawing the artist used. However, the art world has been little touched by signal processing algorithms. Our work develops algorithms to examine x-ray images of paintings, not to analyze the artist’s brushstrokes but to characterize the weave of the canvas that supports the painting. The physics of radiography indicates that linear processing of the x-rays is most appropriate. Our spectral analysis algorithms have an accuracy superior to human spot-measurements and have the advantage that, through “short-space ” Fourier analysis, they can be readily applied to entire x-rays. We have found that variations in the manufacturing process create a unique pattern of horizontal and vertical thread density variations in the bolts of canvas produced. In addition, we measure the <b>thread</b> <b>angles,</b> providing a way to determine the presence of cusping and to infer the location of the tacks used to stretch the canvas on a frame during the priming process. We have developed weave matching software that employs a new correlation measure to find paintings that share canvas weave characteristics. Using a corpus of over 290 paintings attributed to Vincent van Gogh, we have found several weave match cliques that we believe will refine the art historical record and provide more insight into the artist’s creative processes...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the <b>thread's</b> helix <b>angle)</b> and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (<b>thread</b> helix <b>angle)</b> {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|R
