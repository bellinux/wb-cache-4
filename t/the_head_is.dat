5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> a sooty black, {{sometimes}} {{with a faint}} greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving the impression that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{at the tail end}} of the body.|$|E
50|$|Some {{reports say}} that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to a}} nearby café where it was laid {{in front of the}} customers, who were asked to drink in celebration of her death.Some reports state that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> taken to a barber in order to dress the hair to make it {{instantly}} recognizable, though this has <b>been</b> contested.Following this, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> put on <b>the</b> pike again and paraded beneath Marie Antoinette’s window at the Temple.|$|R
50|$|The Dominican friars {{thought that}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} part of the body as the seat of thoughts; that’s way, after drying, <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>were</b> preserved, while <b>the</b> rest of the body was amassed in the charnel house.|$|R

5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin at the top of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> a {{rectangular}} {{section of the}} cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at {{the middle of the}} cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The papan inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is kain panjang or sarong.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> {{enclosed}} in a hard, heavily sclerotized, unsegmented, exoskeletal head capsule, or epicranium, which contains {{most of the}} sensing organs, including the antennae, ocellus or eyes, and the mouthparts. Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites. Here, the vertex, or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different name.|$|E

5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E

5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} determine {{to what extent}} <b>head</b> posture affected <b>the</b> EMG activity of the jaw opening (suprahyoid) and jaw closing (masseter) muscles during chewing. The subjects comprised twenty adult males with normal occlusion. The EMG parameters analyzed were: maximal integrated EMG activity; duration, and coordination of jaw opening and closing muscle activity. Recordings <b>were</b> made with <b>the</b> <b>head</b> in three positions: normal upright, inclined forward, and inclined backward. Maximal integrated EMG activity was reduced for the masseter muscle when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> flexed forward, and for the suprahyoid muscle group when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> flexed backward. <b>The</b> duration of the masseter chewing phase <b>was</b> reduced when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> flexed forward and increased when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> flexed backward. <b>The</b> duration of the suprahyoid chewing phase was unaffected by variation in head position. No absolute reciprocity {{was found between the}} suprahyoid and masseter muscle activity during chewing. Suprahyoid overlap {{at the end of the}} masseter chewing phase <b>was</b> reduced when <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> flexed forward. <b>The</b> amount of masseter overlap at the end of the suprahyoid chewing phase was unaffected by variation in head position...|$|R

5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> held {{vertically}} {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> flower <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> borne in {{clusters}} or somewhat open arrangements. <b>The</b> <b>heads</b> <b>are</b> lined with very glandular phyllaries. Each contains five yellow ray florets, each {{about half a}} centimeter long, and six yellow disc florets.|$|R

5|$|Inspection under {{infrared}} {{has revealed}} that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E
50|$|Third Finding of <b>the</b> <b>Head</b> of St. John the Baptist (May 25). <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> {{transferred}} to Comana of Cappadocia {{during a period}} of Muslim raids (about 820), and it was hidden in the ground {{during a period of}} iconoclastic persecution. When the veneration of icons was restored in 850, Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople (847-857) saw in a vision the place where <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of St. John had been hidden. The patriarch communicated this to the emperor Michael III, who sent a delegation to Comana, where <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> found. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> again {{transferred to}} Nyc, and here on May 25, it was placed in a church at the court.|$|R

25|$|It is {{not clear}} what was done with Saigo's head {{immediately}} after his death. Some legends say Saigo's manservant hid <b>the</b> <b>head,</b> and it <b>was</b> later found by a government soldier. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> somehow retrieved by the government forces and was reunited with Saigo's body, which was laid next to that of his deputies Kirino and Murata. This was witnessed by the American sea captain John Capen Hubbard. A myth persists that <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>was</b> never found.|$|R
5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> flattened. In the male, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> sooty black. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is</b> mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
