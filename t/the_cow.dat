40|$|This article it’s {{presenting}} results {{regarding the}} main reproduction indicators for German Spotted and Frizz Holstein. In stand {{to achieve this}} goal we fallow 3 main reproduction indicators to <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with normal uterine involution and to <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with puerperal infections: uterine repose (UR), Insemination index (Ig) and gestation rate (G). Regarding the uterine repose we notice that there were no significantly differences between the two breeds for <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with normal uterine involution, 114. 00 ± 8. 80 days for German Spotted and 126. 79 ± 12. 86 days for Frizz Holstein. For <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with puerperal infections we notice very significant differences, 128. 58 ± 10. 16 days for German Spotted and 184. 27 ± 12. 68 days for Frizz Holstein. Regarding the number of insemination/gestation {{there were no significant differences}} between <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with normal calving. In this way, the index/gestation was 1. 45 ± 0. 11 for German Spotted and 1. 57 ± 0. 17 for Frizz Holstein. For <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with puerperal infections was a distinguished significant difference regarding the index/gestation, so we have 1. 59 ± 0. 16 for German Spotted and 2. 32 ± 0. 20 for Frizz Holstein. The pregnancy rate for <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with normal uterine involution was 66 % for German Spotted and 64 % for Frizz Holstein. The gestation rate for Frizz Holstein was smaller for both categories (64 % at <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with normal uterine involution and 42 % at <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with puerperal infection). After that research we can conclude that, generally, <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> with post calving infections registered middle values for different reproduction indicators comparative with <b>the</b> healthy <b>cows...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city.

It is believed that after the pandavs completed their 12 years stay at the woods they had to live 2 years hiding their identity before returning to their state. Pandavs were staying in the King Birat's palace, hiding their identity. But the Kauravs might have found out that pandavs were living their so they stole all <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> that belonged to king Birat so as to compel the pandavs to reveal their identity.

50|$|In the Brhaddevata of the Rig Vedic legend, {{composed}} around 400 BCE, Sarama is less {{faithful to}} Indra {{than in the}} original. When the Panis steal <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> of Indra, Indra sends Sarama to them as an envoy. The Panis try to lure Sarama to their side and offer her to share their steal. Sarama refuses but asks for the milk of <b>the</b> <b>cows.</b> <b>The</b> Panis grant her the wish, and, after drinking the excellent demonic milk, Sarama returns to Indra, who questions her about <b>the</b> <b>cows.</b> Sarama, under influence of the milk, pretends ignorance. Agitated, Indra kicks her and she vomits the milk. Frightened, she leads Indra to the cave, who then slaughters the Panis and recovers <b>the</b> <b>cows.</b> A similar account also appears in the Varaha Purana. The demons seize control of Heaven from Indra, who is advised to organize a cow sacrifice to regain control. <b>The</b> <b>cows</b> of <b>the</b> world are gathered for the ceremony and Sarama is {{put in charge of}} them. The demons, however, seize <b>the</b> <b>cows</b> and bribe Sarama with their milk, leaving her alone in the woods. Trembling with fear, Sarama goes to Indra and tells him that she did not know what happened to <b>the</b> <b>cows.</b> <b>The</b> Maruts, who are deputed by Indra to protect Sarama, witness Sarama's treachery and report it to Indra. Indra kicks Sarama in the stomach and she throws up the milk. Sarama then leads Indra to the demons, who are killed by him.

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is <b>the</b> <b>cow</b> pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability.

However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to <b>the</b> <b>cow,</b> and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
