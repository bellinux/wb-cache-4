5|$|At a {{bachelor}} auction, the available bachelors on display are deemed undesirable, and the auction generates no money at all. Marge then nominates Apu, who is deemed a success {{by the women}} at the auction. He goes out on dates {{with many of the}} town's women, and begins to enjoy his bachelor lifestyle. However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend.

5|$|When Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is irritated that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{will not}} fulfill his {{landlord}} responsibilities and fix the dangerously substandard office wiring, {{he comes up}} with a plan <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> magnetic power is affecting the office and thus get the repairs as well as a week off from work for his wife Pam (Jenna Fischer) (whom he is trying to be extra nice to in the wake of not telling her about his new job plans). Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E
25|$|Haymitch warns {{her that}} the danger is far from over. The {{authorities}} are furious at being made fools of, {{and the only way}} to try to allay their anger is <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.|$|E
25|$|The years {{demonstrated}} the increasing difficulty {{to maintain a}} zone in the United States and <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> it worked {{as well as the}} one of Puerto Rico. A reformist movement arose abroad that culminated in 1964 with the establishment of the Phi Sigma Alpha Fraternity composed of active and militant chapters that can be found in Puerto Rico, in the United States or abroad. Therefore, the zones were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
25|$|After four days, Scott began <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> he {{had changed}} his mind, feigning tears and remorse, {{in the hope that}} this would in due course {{give him a chance to}} escape. The final day of his {{imprisonment}} he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E

25|$|Mark grows fond of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), {{who is in}} a rocky {{relationship}} with his enemy, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). When she leaves Phil, she turns to Mark. Mark takes her in and they start dating, much to Pauline's horror. Together, they concoct a plan <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> she is expecting Mark's baby when Phil is the actual biological father. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. Mark loves Lisa so much that he stays with her after she shoots Phil (who survives), and Mark proposes shortly after baby Louise's birth. However, Louise's godmother, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), tells Phil the truth about Louise's parentage and vows to {{take an active role in}} his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short-lived: Lisa is still very much in love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get more access to Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and leaves the Square for a while. After just five months of marriage, Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake and wants to reconcile with Mark but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone.|$|E
25|$|As Kevin {{is leaving}} for the library {{to find out how}} to forge free papers for Dana, she feels the {{dizziness}} coming back. This time, Kevin holds on to her and also travels to the past. They find Rufus writhing in pain from a broken leg. Next to him is a black boy named Nigel, whom they send to the main house for help. Rufus reacts with violent disbelief when he finds out that Kevin and Dana are married: whites and blacks are not allowed to marry in his time. Dana and Kevin then explain to Rufus that they are from the future and prove it by showing the dates stamped on the coins Kevin carries in his pockets. Rufus promises to keep their identity a secret, and Dana tells Kevin <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> he is her owner. When Tom Weylin arrives with his slave Luke to retrieve Rufus, Kevin introduces himself. Weylin grudgingly invites him to dinner. Once back in the Weylin plantation, Margaret, Rufus’s mother, fusses about her son's well-being and, jealous of the attention Rufus shows Dana, sends Dana to the cookhouse. There, Dana meets two house slaves: Sarah, the cook; and Carrie, her mute daughter. Unsure as to what their next move should be, Kevin accepts Weylin's offer to become Rufus's tutor. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks. They observe the relentless cruelty and torture that is rained down upon the slaves by the cold and practical Weylin, the petty and hysterical Margaret, and the capricious and spoiled Rufus. While none are sadistic or evil, they all feel entitled to treat the slaves as property. Weylin catches Dana reading and whips her mercilessly. The dizziness overcomes her before Kevin can reach her and she travels back to 1976 alone.|$|E

500|$|Ron Currie Jr. named World War Z {{one of his}} {{favorite}} apocalyptic novels and praised Brooks for illustrating [...] "the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories {{about the end of the}} world ... agree <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> this is not fiction, that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality."

500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious much of what I say [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be absurd <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> much of what I say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E
500|$|Although Eugenides sought {{expert advice}} about intersex, sexology, and the {{formation}} of gender identity, he refrained from meeting with intersex people, saying, [...] " [...] decided not to work in that reportorial mode. Instead of trying to create a separate person, I tried <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> I had this [...] and that I had lived through this as much as I could". Eugenides read books, sifted through many sheets of microfiche, and combed through videotapes and newsletters that dealt with the subject. He visited the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture to search for the sole copy of a book about an [...] "elusive historical figure". He discovered details of what he considered a vivid intersex condition while browsing Columbia University's medical library.|$|E

500|$|Finally, the Lithuanian side {{considered}} the Żeligowski's attack on Vilnius {{a violation of}} the Suwałki agreement and as a major argument in international mediation. Poland disagreed and protested such interpretation of the document. At first Poland claimed that Żeligowski was a rebel who acted without approval from the Polish government. Later Piłsudski's role in the attack was acknowledged, but the Polish side argued that the agreement was not violated, as the attack was held to the east from the demarcation line. The League of Nations {{considered the}} Polish attack {{a violation of the}} agreement, but placed emphasis on resumption of the hostilities and not subsequent territorial changes. Senn said the view that the agreement has not been violated was [...] "specious". In his opinion, Piłsudski himself did not seem to share that view, as evidenced by his attempt <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> the attacking forces were [...] "rebels".|$|E
500|$|The Mothers of Invention {{played in}} New York in late 1966 and were offered a {{contract}} at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, {{along with the}} Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became {{a regular part of}} the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> it was a [...] "gook baby".|$|E

Precious has been raped by her father, Carl (Rodney [...] "Bear" [...] Jackson), resulting in two pregnancies. The family resides in a Section 8 tenement and survives on welfare. Her first child, [...] "Mongo" [...] (short for Mongoloid), has Down syndrome and is being cared for by Precious' grandmother, though Mary forces the family <b>to</b> <b>pretend</b> <b>that</b> Mongo lives with her and Precious so she can receive extra money from the government.
