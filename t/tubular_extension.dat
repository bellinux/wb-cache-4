40|$|The {{synthesis}} of "very low" density lipoprotein in liver cells {{is characterized by}} the fact that the synthesized products, mostly triglycerides, are processed in the form of discrete, size-limited granules or globules, about 400 A in diameter. The present investigation has been made possible in part by the use of a fixative (OsO 4 in bidistilled H 2 O at pH 6. 0, in the absence of electrolytes) particularly effective in preserving cytoplasmic membranes and lipids, and giving them high stainability and differential contrast. Under these technical conditions, the lipoprotein granules retain their morphology and high density to electrons practically unaltered, and may serve as tracers in determining their route of transport from the sites of synthesis, starting at the rough-smooth ER junctions, to the lumen of Golgi concentrating vesicles. From the observations, it may be deduced that, along with lipoprotein granule synthesis and transport, there are also production and transfer of new membranes in the form of <b>tubular</b> <b>extensions</b> of smooth ER network which, by progressive fusion and coalescence, participate in the elaboration of fenestrated plates and solid Golgi sacs. In contradistinction to the entire process of liver lipoprotein granule synthesis, transport, and segregation, as reported in the present paper, appears to constitute a developmental sequence which includes the following communicating compartments, in consecutive order: cisternae of rough ER where proteins and possibly phospholipids are synthesized, smooth ER network where triglycerides are synthesized and transported in the form of dense granules, fusion of smooth ER <b>tubular</b> <b>extensions</b> into Golgi fenestrated plates, and further coalescence into solid Golgi sacs, ending in the segregation of the granules in appended concentrating vesicles, or detached "secretory vesicles.

40|$|WNK kinases are a {{small group}} of unique serine/threonine protein kinases that are conserved among {{multicellular}} organisms. Mutations in WNK 1 – 4 cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II—a form of hypertension. WNKs have been linked to the STE 20 kinases and ion carriers, but the underlying molecular mechanisms by which WNKs regulate cellular processes in whole animals are unknown. The Caenorhabditis elegans WNK-like kinase WNK- 1 interacts with and phosphorylates germinal centre kinase (GCK) - 3 —a STE 20 -like kinase—which is known to inactivate CLH- 3, a CIC chloride channel. The wnk- 1 or gck- 3 deletion mutation causes an Exc phenotype, a defect in the <b>tubular</b> <b>extension</b> of excretory canals. Expression of the activated form of GCK- 3 or the clh- 3 deletion mutation can partly suppress wnk- 1 or gck- 3 defects, respectively.

40|$|Two basic {{structural}} {{components are}} concerned in {{the elaboration of}} the pore canal system in the mineralized cuticle of the decapod crab Carcinus maenas: <b>tubular</b> cytoplasmic <b>extensions</b> originating from epidermis and vertical fibres. These components are present {{from the moment the}} first procuticular materials of the new cuticle are laid down but their organization varies according to a precise schedule during the further moult cycle stages. Cytoplasmic extensions form a complicated branching system connecting the epidermal layer with all regions of the cullcular compartment, at least transitorily. During the moult cycle the prolongation of this cellular system appears to result from two concomitant but opposite phenomena. Before ecdysis the growth of cell extensions in the proximal cuticular layers prevails over their regression at the distal level. During the post-moult period these phenomena are reversed in importance so that the pore canal system is without cytoplasmic material as soon as intermoult starts. The depositing of vertical fibres takes place in close contact with the proximal cell extension plasma membrane, which never bears dense plaques. As moult stages progress, they are gradually organized into twisted sheaths that persist throughout the intermoult. Incidentally, some fibres invade the pore canal lumen freed from cell extensions. Some aspects regarding the fine organization, the chemical composition and the functional significance of both epidermal <b>tubular</b> <b>extensions</b> or vertical fibres are also discussed in the light of previous investigations carried out on crustaceans and in other arthropods. © 1987.

Methods:Prospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair at a single institution with Stentor® and Vanguard® grafts from March 1995 to March 1997. Setting:Academic teaching hospitalResults:Two procedures were converted for other reasons than leak. In the remaining 48 successful procedures endoleaks were detected in 11 (22. 9 %) : proximal aortic leak (2. 1 %), distal aortic leak (8. 3 %), iliac leak (12. 5 %). Leaks were treated at the initial procedure in five patients, resulting in 87. 5 % excluded aneurysms. Twelve and a half per cent were discharged with a primary leak. Redo was performed on all iliac leaks within 7 weeks. All aortic leaks showed spontaneous thrombosis within 3 months, but reappeared with local aneurysm expansion. Aortic redo-procedures were performed by proximal <b>tubular</b> <b>extension</b> or converting a tube graft into a bifurcation graft. All rescue procedures were successful.

40|$|Cell {{membrane}} proteins, both {{bound and}} integral, {{are known to}} preferentially accumulate at membrane locations with curvatures favorable to their shape. This is mainly due to the curvature dependent interaction between membrane proteins and their lipid environment. Here, we analyze {{the effects of the}} protein-lipid bilayer interaction energy due to mismatch between the protein shape and the principal curvatures of the surrounding bilayer. The role of different macroscopic parameters that define the interaction energy term is elucidated in relation to recent experiment in which the lateral distribution of a membrane embedded protein potassium channel KvAP is measured on a giant unilamellar lipid vesicle (reservoir) and a narrow <b>tubular</b> <b>extension</b> - a tether - kept at constant length. The dependence of the sorting ratio, defined as the ratio between the areal density of the protein on the tether and on the vesicle, on the inverse tether radius is influenced by the strength of the interaction, the intrinsic shape of the membrane embedded protein, and its abundance in the reservoir. It is described how the values of these constants can be extracted from experiments. The intrinsic principal curvatures of a protein are related to the tether radius at which the sorting ratio attains its maximum value. The estimate of the principal intrinsic curvature of the protein KvAP, obtained by comparing the experimental and theoretical sorting behavior, is consistent with the available information on its structure...|$|E

In the seminal vesicle, both sperm types occur, either as free cells or organized into spermatozeugmata. It is shown that the elongate (120 - 140 μm), flagellum-like component of the paraspermatozoon {{is in fact a}} <b>tubular</b> <b>extension</b> of the plasma membrane which encloses granular material but no axonemes or microtubules. This structure, here termed the pseudotrich, shows no evidence of motility and its function remains obscure. The main body region of the paraspermatozoon (length 32 - 36 μm) contains numerous spherical vesicles, scattered mitochondria, one or two large, rod-shaped bodies (length 20 - 24 μm) and a fusiform, granular body (containing DNA; probably a modified nucleus). The rod-shaped bodies, granular body and surrounding matrix are contained by a common membrane, and are therefore separated from other contents of the paraspermatozoon. In each spermatozeugma, euspermatozoa are attached via the tips of their acrosomes to the paraspermatozoan body at the opposite end to the pseudotrich. Euspermatozoa exhibit a conical acrosomal complex (with axial rod and basal plate), a tubular nucleus sheathing the axoneme, a midpiece (5 - 6 helical mitochondrial elements sheathing the axoneme), an annulus (with two rings), a glycopen piece and an end piece (total sperm length 268 - 272 μm).

Here we identify a previously uncharacterized type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells. Using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we visualized transfer of cytoplasmic fluorescent molecules between adjacent cells. Additionally, by coculturing strains harboring different antibiotic resistance genes, we demonstrated that molecular exchange enables cells to transiently acquire nonhereditary resistance. Furthermore, nonconjugative plasmids could be transferred from one cell to another, thereby conferring hereditary features to recipient cells. Electron microscopy revealed the existence of variously sized <b>tubular</b> <b>extensions</b> bridging neighboring cells, serving as a route for exchange of intracellular molecules.
