5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. <b>This</b> <b>premise</b> served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E

5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. The record is a social critique which utilizes <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E
5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, charging that Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30—8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E

25|$|The {{bill did}} carve out certain {{exceptions}} to <b>this</b> <b>premise,</b> principally involving {{the creation and}} dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as civil unions, created in other states.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} mentions of <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> {{occurs in}} the Rigveda, and a complete {{version of the story}} is traceable to the Buddhist text Udana 6.4, dated to about mid 1st millennium BCE. According to John Ireland, the parable is likely older than the Buddhist text.|$|E
25|$|Schellenberg says he hasn't {{seen any}} serious {{objections}} to <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder {{writes about the}} possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.|$|E

50|$|An early {{customer}} of {{this line}} was a carriage building company called Quadling. Initially starting business as Catt and Quadling {{they built a}} number of carriages for the EUR at a works in Handford Road in Ipswich. <b>This</b> <b>premises</b> which had no railway access was blown down in a gale in February 1847 damaging several carriages under construction and after that Catt withdrew from the rail {{side of the business}} but continued making road carts. Quadling relocated to new premises (located in the modern day Quadling Street in Ipswich) and had a siding off the branch. The company built further carriages for the EUR and Great Western Railway as well as some coal wagons. However <b>this</b> <b>premises</b> also suffered significant gale damage in February 1863 leading to Quadling becoming bankrupt.|$|R

25|$|The United States District Court for the District of Alaska {{dismissed}} Frederick's case on summary judgment. The {{district court}} reasoned that Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, {{as opposed to}} Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, governed Frederick's school speech. Under <b>this</b> <b>premise,</b> the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on drug abuse prevention.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} production {{involved a}} story {{that took place in}} the distant future. In this story, a crew of explorers in a spaceship visit an abandoned planet, discovering signs of an extraterrestrial civilization that left behind technological artifacts. The explorers initially assume that the occupants of the planet had died off, seeing no sign of them, but as the story progresses, the player was meant to discover something very different. <b>This</b> <b>premise</b> is similar to the finished game's story, but contains clear differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} Disney wanted to merge Tokyo (which {{is where the}} comic book version takes place) with San Francisco was partly because San Francisco had not been used by Marvel before, partly {{because of all the}} city's iconic aspects, and partly because they felt its {{aesthetics}} would blend well with Tokyo. The filmmakers' idea was that San Fransokyo is based on an alternate history in which San Francisco was largely rebuilt by Japanese immigrants {{in the aftermath of the}} 1906 earthquake, although <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> is never stated in the film.|$|E

Virtual Representation was the British response to the First Continental Congress in the American colonies. The Second Continental Congress asked for representation in Parliament in the Suffolk Resolves, also known as the first Olive Branch Petition. Parliament claimed that their members had the well being of the colonists in mind. The Colonies rejected <b>this</b> <b>premise.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the trial was the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the first ever Sicilian Mafiosi boss to become an informant (pentito). His assertion that the Mafia was not a collection of separate gangs but a single organisation led some magistrates and detectives to question his credibility. After an interview, Falcone became convinced that Buscetta was genuine and treated him with respect. Buscetta's key revelation was that a governing council, known as the Commission or Cupula headed a collective structure, thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes. <b>This</b> <b>premise</b> became known as the Buscetta theorem.|$|E
25|$|While {{acknowledging}} the cross-influences, most contemporary historians distinguish the Haitian Revolution from the French Revolution. Some even separate {{it from the}} mulattoes' earlier armed conflicts, which at first sought political rights for themselves, but not the abolition of slavery. These scholars show that if the agency of the enslaved blacks becomes the focus of studies, the Revolution's opening and closing dates are certain. From <b>this</b> <b>premise,</b> the narrative began with the enslaved blacks' bid for freedom through armed struggle and concluded with their victory over slaving powers {{and the creation of}} an independent state. In April 1791, a massive black insurgency turned violently against the plantation system, setting a precedent of resistance to racial slavery. In cooperation with their former mulatto rivals, blacks ended the Revolution in November 1803 when they decidedly defeated the French army at the Battle of Vertières.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} Advaita Vedanta explains all {{reality and}} everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, {{and there is no}} dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With <b>this</b> <b>premise,</b> the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati).|$|E
25|$|A central axiom of Marxism is {{that the}} liberation {{of the working class}} must come {{at the hands of the}} working class itself. That <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> has been {{advanced}} by an unending string of middle-class intellectuals ranging from the professor-without-portfolio Dr. Karl Marx to the college-educated lawyer V. I. Lenin to lawyer and university lecturer Daniel DeLeon may be characterized as either inevitable, ironic, or a major contradiction, depending on one's personal perspective. Be that as it may, Marxists have universally assumed that only conscious and concerted effort by the working class itself can lead to cause the revolutionary transformation of economy and society. The devil lies in the details—how best to motivate this state of understanding and drive to action among those who sell their labor-power to others, how best to achieve the transformation of state and society.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply <b>this</b> <b>premise</b> by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E

The Loughborough Road Church was then used by the amalgamated congregations and still exists as the Thringstone Methodist Church. <b>This</b> <b>premises</b> was extended by the addition of a hall and connecting corridor at the rear in 1975.

On the basis of <b>this</b> <b>premises,</b> we will highlight the specificities of this process from two different but interrelated points of observation, i. e. domestic and urban space. Both these spatial-temporal contexts are domesticated by those everyday practices producing ontological security while transforming space and its objects to their own ends. In this way they modify its significance and contextually redesign the public- private boundaries...|$|R
