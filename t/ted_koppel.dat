5|$|Next {{came the}} {{assembly}} {{of a team of}} producers who were to organize the festival's events. Notably Kyle Gibson, an Emmy Award-winning former producer of Nightline with <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> joined the festival as senior program producer, while production of the Youth and Family Program was put into the hands of Robin Reardon, a former show producer for Walt Disney Imagineering and former vice president of Universal Studios Creative, who also became the festival's managing director.|$|E
50|$|During <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> critique, The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Critical Look, Koppel stated he had denials {{from three}} people Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.|$|R

50|$|On November 22, 2005, Albom was {{the sole}} and final guest on <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> {{farewell}} appearance on ABC’s Nightline. Koppel had gotten to know Albom through his broadcasts with Morrie Schwartz and the final program dealt with the legacy of those shows and Albom’s book.|$|R
5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and ABC's <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> the Iraq-gate story never picked up much momentum, {{even though the}} U.S. Congress became {{involved}} with the scandal.

5000|$|Wolfe holds five Emmy Awards earned over {{a decade}} as a {{producer}} for <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel’s</b> Nightline on ABC News. [...] Over {{the course of her}} career, Wolfe conducted interviews with leading newsmakers, heads of state, and celebrities, including Salman Rushdie, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Yasser & Suha Arafat, and Yitzhak Rabin. After her Nightline tenure, Wolfe became an independent media consultant.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, Stephan Strothe {{was offered}} his first {{full-time}} {{job in the}} newsroom of ARD’s Tagesthemen, which, in content and prestige, is comparable to ABC’s Nightline during <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel’s</b> tenure. In October 1984, Stephan Strothe left ARD to work for Germany’s first commercial TV network, SAT.1, where he {{was head of the}} network’s news department and was later named assistant editor-in-chief. In 1988, Stephan Strothe opened SAT.1’s New York bureau, the first for a German commercial TV network.|$|R

25|$|On January 4, 2006, Discovery Communications {{announced}} anchor <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> {{executive producer}} Tom Bettag and eight other former staff {{members from the}} ABC newsmagazine Nightline were joining Discovery Channel. The network was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards that year for shows including The Flight that Fought Back (a documentary about the hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93 during {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001) and Deadliest Catch (a reality series about a group of seafood fishermen).|$|E
25|$|With anchorman <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> in {{position}} in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous {{coverage of the}} quake at about 5:40p.m., {{at the same time}} as CBS News; Al Michaels, in the process, became a de facto on-site reporter for ABC. NBC News also began continuous coverage, with Tom Brokaw, about an hour later. The Goodyear blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations.|$|E
50|$|In April 1997, Wolfe {{hosted a}} {{televised}} {{account of the}} Hajj from Mecca for <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> Nightline on ABC. The program was nominated for Peabody, Emmy, George Polk, and National Press Club Awards. It won the annual Media Award from the Muslim Public Affairs Council. In February 2003, Wolfe worked with CNN International television news reporter Zain Verjee to produce a new half-hour documentary on the Hajj. Wolfe has been featured on hundreds of regional and national radio talk shows.|$|R
50|$|He has {{appeared}} on the Donahue Show eight times since 1980, Good Morning America, the Today Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Gary Collins, Peter Jennings’ ABC Nightly News, and <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel’s</b> Nightline. He has been a consultant numerous times on the Joan Rivers Show and ABC News, {{and has been a}} regular contributor many times on KMOX, WOR, and NPR radio. He was one of four physicians picked to be on the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment study to help infertile couples in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Pozner {{worked as}} chief {{commentator}} for the North American {{service of the}} Radio Moscow network. Beginning the early 1970s, and lasting until the early 1990s, he was a regular guest on Ray Briem's talk show on KABC in Los Angeles. During the 1980s, he was a favourite guest on <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> Nightline. Pozner was the host of Moscow Meridian, an English-language current affairs program focusing on the Soviet Union; the show was produced by Gosteleradio, the Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio and broadcast on the Satellite Program Network. He also often appeared on The Phil Donahue Show.|$|R
25|$|In {{the evening}} of 25 October 1983 by telephone, on the {{newscast}} Nightline, anchor <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> spoke to medical students on Grenada who stated that they were safe and did not feel their lives were in danger. The next evening, again by telephone, medical students told Koppel how grateful they were for the invasion and the Army Rangers, which probably saved their lives. State Department officials had assured the medical students {{that they would be}} able to complete their medical school education in the United States.|$|E
25|$|After about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne and subsequently, The Wonder Years in the meantime), ABC {{was able}} to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by-play man, Al Michaels (who was {{familiar}} with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series.|$|E
25|$|From then {{until her}} {{renunciation}} of the Church of Satan in 1990, Zeena appeared in such nationally syndicated programs as The Phil Donahue Show, Nightline with <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> Entertainment Tonight, The Late Show, Secrets & Mysteries and the Sally Jesse Raphael Show. The appearances {{were made at}} the behest of the Church of Satan as its spokesperson. She did this on behalf of her father Anton LaVey, who was no longer interested in making media appearances, as she stated while being interviewed alongside her husband by televangelist Bob Larson.|$|E
50|$|He became {{anchor of}} Focus Report on China Central Television {{when it was}} the only news {{commentary}} program in China. During his time as anchor, Bai covered news stories such as the handovers of Hong Kong and Macau, the 50th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, and the Sydney Olympics, making him one of the most recognizable figures in China. He has also established several news programs on CCTV such as Timeline, modeled after <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> Nightline on ABC News. Bai's reporting was the primary subject of a book about Focus Report that was written by the show's producer. News 1 + 1, another news program Bai started, was the first live news commentary program in China.|$|R
50|$|That night, the {{traditional}} Victory Banquet {{was held at}} the Indiana Convention Center in downtown Indianapolis, with Andretti the new guest of honor. The mood was subdued, and the event was overshadowed by large-scale media attention (Bobby Unser did not attend the banquet). The winner's share of the purse was announced, but the pay envelope presented to Andretti was empty. Andretti was presented with the official pace car but was not given the keys. <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> Nightline focused the evening's program on the controversy and included a live interview with Andretti who compared the situation to the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, a race in which he won on the track, but was stripped of victory when officials deemed he jumped the start.|$|R

25|$|Following the March 4, 2007, {{airing of}} The Lost Tomb of Jesus on the Discovery Channel, American {{journalist}} <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> aired a program entitled The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look, whose guests included the director Simcha Jacobovici, James Tabor, Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte {{who served as}} a consultant and advisor on the documentary, Jonathan Reed, Professor of Religion at the University of LaVerne and co-author of Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text, and William Dever, an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.|$|E
25|$|Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. At ABC News, Wallace was {{the senior}} {{correspondent}} for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli Government {{did not want}} to advertise where the Scuds landed, in order to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Nightline host <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> cut him off, and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, David Miscavige, the church's leader, in 1992 told <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> in an {{interview}} on the Nightline program: ...|$|E
5000|$|During <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel's</b> {{tenure as}} anchor (and on rare {{occasions}} since his departure), Nightline devoted each episode to a unique subject. Since its inception, the program has covered many subjects (science, education, politics, economics, society, and breaking news). Many candidates for government offices, such as David Duke (in November 1991) have appeared on Nightline to try to promote themselves. Seeing {{that there are a}} large number of prisons in the United States, it created an ongoing series in 1994 called [...] "Crime and Punishment". Over the years, Nightline had a number of technological firsts. The program did the first live report from the base of Mount Everest. In November 1992, science reporter Michael Guillen did the first live broadcast from Antarctica. There were times when a major breaking news story occurred as late as 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, resulting in the subject of that night's edition being changed in order to cover the story in some form of detail, depending on the depth of information available at the time of broadcast. Examples of this were the deaths of John Lennon (1980) and Yasser Arafat (2004).|$|R
5000|$|Koppel {{became known}} for his work as {{the host of a}} late night news program called Nightline. The program {{originated}} as a series of special reports about the 444-day long Iranian hostage crisis, during which Iranian militants held 52 American captive, beginning in early November 1979. At first, the program was called America Held Hostage, and was hosted by veteran news reporter Frank Reynolds. Koppel eventually joined Reynolds as co-anchor. In March 1980, the program evolved into Nightline, with Koppel as its host. In 1990 ABC News ran a one-hour special called [...] "The Best of Nightline with <b>Ted</b> Koppel." [...] <b>Koppel</b> spent twenty-five years anchoring the program, before leaving ABC (and leaving as host of Nightline) in late November 2005.|$|R

500|$|For this reason, {{commentators}} such as Howard Dean and <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> {{posited that}} Stewart {{served as a}} real source of news for young people, regardless of his intentions. In 2016, a The New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that The Daily Show was [...] "most popular in cities and other more liberal-leaning areas along the coasts. Peak popularity is in San Francisco; it's least popular in Alabama".|$|E
500|$|Hair {{has been}} {{performed}} {{in most of}} the countries of the world. [...] After the Berlin Wall fell, the show traveled {{for the first time to}} Poland, Lebanon, the Czech Republic and Sarajevo (featured on ABC's Nightline with <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> when Phil Alden Robinson visited that city in 1996 and discovered a production of Hair there in the midst of the war). [...] In 1999, Michael Butler and director Bo Crowell helped produce Hair in Russia at the Stas Namin Theatre located in Moscow's Gorky Park. [...] The Moscow production caused a similar reaction as the original did 30years earlier because Russian soldiers were fighting in Chechnya at the time.|$|E
500|$|After the crash, {{there were}} {{claims that the}} media frenzy around the [...] "bogus" [...] record attempt contributed to the {{accident}} by helping promote the flight and pressuring its schedule. This {{was supported by the}} NTSB, which determined that the pressure induced by the intense media attention was a [...] "contributing factor" [...] in the accident. ABC's <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> reflected on the media's role in the tragedy on Nightline: [...] "We need to begin by acknowledging our own contribution...We feed one another: those of you looking for publicity and those of us looking for stories." [...] Koppel ended by asking [...] "whether we in the media...by our ravenous attention contribute to this phenomenon", and answered: [...] "We did." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?" [...] was often directed to her. <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> questioned her closely about nuclear strategy and during Meet the Press she was asked, [...] "Do you think that in any way the Soviets might be tempted to try to take advantage of you simply because you are a woman?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Thorne {{came out}} to his squadronmates, who he later stated were supportive: [...] "It was a {{complete}} non-issue". In April he spoke with an aide of Colorado congresswoman Pat Schroeder, who encouraged him {{to go public with}} his story to build popular support for a bill to overturn the ban on gay service members. Thorne agreed to do so, and completed the process of coming out to family members, including his father and brother. On May 19, 1992, during a presidential campaign in which Democratic candidate Bill Clinton was proposing an end to the military's exclusion of homosexuals, Thorne openly identified as homosexual during an interview with <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> on the ABC television news program Nightline. Thorne later appeared on NBC's Today Show and CNN's Sonya Live.|$|E
500|$|Production for Watchmen began casting in July 2007 for look-alikes of the era's famous {{names for}} the film—something Snyder {{declared}} would give the film a [...] "satirical quality" [...] and [...] "create this ’80s vibe"— including Richard Nixon, Leonid Brezhnev, Henry Kissinger, H. R. Haldeman, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> John McLaughlin, Annie Leibovitz, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Fidel Castro, Albert Einstein, Norman Rockwell, John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Elvis Presley, Mao Zedong, Larry King, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Lee Iacocca, and the Village People. Snyder said he wanted younger actors because of the many flashback scenes, and {{it was easier to}} age actors with make-up rather than cast two actors in the same role. Snyder's son cameos as a young Rorschach, while the director himself appears as an American soldier in Vietnam. Actor Thomas Jane was invited by Snyder, but declined to work in the film due to being too busy.|$|E
