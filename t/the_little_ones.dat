25|$|The {{character}} of Peter Pan was invented to entertain George and Jack. Barrie would say, to amuse them, that their little brother Peter could fly. He claimed that babies were birds {{before they were}} born; parents put bars on nursery windows to keep <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones</b> from flying away. This grew into a tale of a baby boy who did fly away.|$|E

500|$|Afonso was healthy, and as {{the eldest}} son of PedroII, was {{heir to the throne}} and styled [...] "Prince Imperial". The young prince resembled his father, {{particularly}} in his face, hair and eyes. Because of his gender and position as heir apparent, he became the center of attention, particularly for PedroII. A letter written by PedroII to his elder sister MariaII {{a few months after the}} birth of his second child—a daughter named Isabel—displayed his happiness: [...] "No news here save the good state of health of myself, of the empress, and of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones,</b> who are becoming increasingly cute, principally little Afonso, who is already walking and who says many words, still half incomprehensible, the which increases their charm." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One</b> - a {{diminutive}} and enigmatic figure, approximately {{the height of}} a small child, constantly swaddled in an oversize raincoat and battered fedora, from under which peer two bright eyes. <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One</b> (no known gender) is a formidable telepath, and hangs out with Raoul because his drug-induced bliss is soothing. Raoul also acts as its mouthpiece, as <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One</b> cannot (or at least does not) talk. <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One's</b> only known armament is a blowgun with poisoned darts; its main talent is to keep Raoul focused and provide the team with telepathic reconnaissance. <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>One</b> is eventually revealed to be a Tongan, a member of an extremely reclusive race, and becomes the first recorded example of that species in medical history. Xris made that discovery after finding him {{in a pool of blood}} in a hotel bathroom, thinking him almost dead. Dr. Quong revealed that the injuries were mild and he looked that way normally.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{continued}} that <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones</b> — whom the Israelites said would be carried off — would also enter and possess the land. The Israelites replied that now {{they would go}} up and fight, just as God commanded them, but God told Moses to warn them not to, as God would not travel in their midst {{and they would be}} routed by their enemies. Moses told them, but they would not listen, but flouted God's command and willfully marched into the hill country. Then the Amorites who lived in those hills came out like so many bees and crushed the Israelites at Hormah in Seir.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Xou's {{debut in}} Brazil, Xuxa has enjoyed {{unprecedented}} following. In Brazil alone, her program has achieved an estimated viewership of 33 million, the largest audience ever garnered by TV Globo, the dominant television network in that country. Those kids who tuned in every weekday saw Xuxa arrived for each episode {{in a pink}} spaceship. The show had singing, dancing, skits, games, and jokes, and the actress would end the show with the famous [...] "Xuxa kiss." [...] For the kiss, Xuxa would put on bright lipstick and kiss the children participating in the show {{and children in the}} audience on the cheek, leaving the imprimit of her lipstick. The Xou da Xuxa stopped filming in 1992 but was followed by a program that only ran on Sunday called, simply, Xuxa. In all, 2,000 episode were recorded in Brazil and aired over six years and seven months. The immense popularity of the original Xou da Xuxa lead to a series of others children's television programs starring the actress. In 1991, a purely musical program called the Paradão dos Baixinhos (<b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Ones</b> Charts) premiered and ran concurrently with the Xou.|$|E

2500|$|Also on 24 July, after Berchtold {{met with}} the Russian chargé d'affaires, furious {{complaints}} were prompted from Berlin, warning that Austria should not engage in talks with any other powers in case a compromise might be worked out. That same day, Wilhelm wrote on the margin of a dispatch from Count Tschirschky, calling Austria-Hungary [...] "weak" [...] for not being aggressive enough in the Balkans, and writing that alteration in the power in the Balkans [...] "has got to come. Austria must become predominant in the Balkans as compared to <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones,</b> and at Russia’s expense." [...] Count Szögyény reported to Vienna that [...] "here, it is generally taken for granted that if Serbia rejects our demands, we shall at once reply by declaring war, and opening military operations. We are advised... to confront {{the world with a}} fait accompli (emphasis in the original)." [...] When the German ambassador in Belgrade reported how sad the Serbian people were with being faced with the choice of either war or national humiliation, Wilhelm wrote on the margins of the report: [...] "Bravo! One would not have believed it of the Viennese!... How hollow the whole Serbian power is proving itself to be; thus, it is seen to be with all the Slav nations! Just tread hard on the heels of that rabble!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones</b> in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the long}} sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob called Benjamin a ravenous wolf that devours its prey. The editor summarises: [...] "these are the twelve tribes". And Jacob charged his sons to bury {{him with his}} fathers in the cave of Machpelah that Abraham bought and where they buried Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and where he buried Leah. And then Jacob {{gathered}} his feet into his bed and died. Joseph kissed his father's face and wept. Joseph commanded the physicians to embalm Jacob, and they did so over the next 40 days, and the Egyptians wept for Jacob 70 days. Thereafter, Joseph asked Pharaoh's courtiers to tell Pharaoh that Jacob had made Joseph swear to bury him {{in the land of}} Canaan and ask that he might go up, bury his father, and return. Pharaoh consented, and Joseph went up with all Pharaoh's court, Egypt's elders, chariots, horsemen, and all Joseph's relatives, leaving only <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>ones</b> and the flocks and herds behind in the land of Goshen. At the threshing-floor of Atad, beyond the Jordan River, they mourned for his father seven days, and the Canaanites remarked at how grievous the mourning was for the Egyptians, and thus the place was named Abel-mizraim. Jacob's sons carried out his command and buried him in the cave of Machpelah, and the funeral party returned to Egypt. With Jacob's death, Joseph's brothers grew concerned that Joseph would repay them for the evil that they had done, and they sent Joseph a message that Jacob had commanded him to forgive them. When the brothers spoke to Joseph, he wept, and his brothers fell down before him and declared that they were his bondmen. Joseph told them not to fear, for he was not God, and even though they had intended him evil, God meant it for good, to save many people. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
