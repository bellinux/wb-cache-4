5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail line from the existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> gauge line with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the narrow gauge line was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. <b>This</b> <b>narrow</b> and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. <b>This</b> <b>narrow</b> and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E

5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E

25|$|Askin's {{resignation}} in 1975 {{was followed}} by a number of short lived premierships by Liberal Party leaders. When a general election came in 1976 the ALP under Neville Wran were returned to power.

It runs north-east, entering Paris at Porte de Versailles, a major station with three tracks, one of which gives access to the workshop at Vaugirard. The line then runs underneath rue de Vaugirard, following all the bends of <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> street.|$|E
25|$|However, the Bible itself {{indicates}} that Noah restricted his curse to {{the offspring of}} Ham's youngest son Canaan, whose descendants occupied the Levant, {{and it was not}} extended to Ham's other sons, who had migrated into Africa. According to Sanders, 18th-century theologians increasingly emphasized <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> restriction and accurate interpretation of the passage as applying to Canaan's offspring. They rejected the curse as a justification for slavery.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} to the church, a single door in the south transept—through the crusader façade—is found past a group of streets winding through the outer Via Dolorosa, {{by way of a}} local souq in the Muristan. <b>This</b> <b>narrow</b> way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the trams were {{introduced}} an impediment to efficient transport along Richmond Street was the curve in the street at Moyer's building works (west corner of Lennox Street, {{was part of the}} Portobello College complex until its demolition in 2006). The constant traffic in and out of Moyer's blocked the traffic at <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> spot. Despite complaints, the curve was never removed, and is there to this day.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} is that IMF programs are only {{designed to address}} poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.|$|E
50|$|Narrowing {{allows the}} {{elimination}} of values that do not satisfy a variable's constraints.

25|$|The {{entrance}} to the active site for this enzyme is made up mainly of several arginine, histidine, serine, and aspartate side-chains, with a glutamate side-chain playing a secondary role. These side-chains, to be specific Arg359, Arg528, His469, and Ser386, are conserved within each transketolase enzyme and interact with the phosphate group of the donor and acceptor substrates. Because the substrate channel is so narrow, the donor and acceptor substrates cannot be bound simultaneously. Also, the substrates conform into a slightly extended form upon binding in the active site to accommodate <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> channel.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>narrow</b> {{valley of}} the Danube around Melk is {{reminiscent}} of the great wine areas of the Rhine, with steep terraces that produce world-class Grüner Veltliner and Riesling wines. Climatically and geologically it marks the transition from the Alps to the Hungarian plains, leading to a diverse array of microclimates and terroir, with the river moderating the effects of the cold Alpine winds. As mentioned above, the Vinea Wachau Nobilis Districtus still clings to its own classification of Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd, reserved for wines that are made 100% from Wachau grapes.|$|E
25|$|This tactic {{worked and}} the Dutch, with their ranks broken, fled towards the sea. In <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> stretch of open beach, the Dutch {{suffered}} {{a large number}} of casualties and many threw themselves into the sea. Dutch ships fired volleys of artillery at Portuguese forces. Shallops and 35 launches came to the aid of the Dutch troops with reserve forces, officers and ammunition. They picked up men from the sea preventing them from drowning. Shallops continued to fire at Portuguese soldiers with muskets and cannons.|$|E

25|$|As {{detention}} {{under the}} CLTPA does not put a detainee in jeopardy of possible trial and punishment for an alleged offence, the detention is, in <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> sense, {{not a criminal}} cause or matter. Therefore, if a detainee wishes to challenge the legality of his detention, he must apply for an order for review of detention (formerly known as a writ of habeas corpus) under the civil procedure of the Supreme Court. However, it is not within the court's province to determine that a detainee should be charged and tried in open court rather than be detained.|$|E
25|$|The Helvellyn range runs broadly {{north to}} south for about 7miles, {{remaining}} above 2,000ft (600m) throughout its length. Helvellyn itself sits near the centre of this ridge and displays the characteristic form {{of many of these}} fells, namely smooth grassy slopes to the west and shattered rock to the east. Helvellyn sends out two eastward arêtes, razor-thin ridges between deep mountain corries. The southerly spur is Striding Edge, easily the most famous ridge in the district, and its northern partner is Swirral Edge. From the summit plateau of Helvellyn a rough slope drops to the start of Swirral Edge, and <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> ridge curves gracefully down and then back up over half a mile, terminating at Catstye Cam.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, Truscott's {{trial began}} in the then Supreme Court of Ontario in Goderich before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was {{represented}} by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper's death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. Key to <b>this</b> <b>narrow</b> window was the autopsy doctor's testimony that the decomposition of Lynne's body {{and the state of}} partially digested food in her stomach indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Mr. Justice Ferguson, then sentenced Truscott to death (to hang).|$|E
