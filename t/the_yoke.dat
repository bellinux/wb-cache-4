5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. <b>The</b> <b>yoke</b> is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make <b>the</b> <b>yoke</b> impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} with adult humans investigated {{the effects of}} response-contingent money loss (response-cost punishment) on monetary-reinforced responding. A yoked-control procedure was used to separate the effects on responding of the response-cost contingency {{from the effects of}} reduced reinforcement density. Eight adults pressed buttons for money on a three-component multiple reinforcement schedule. During baseline, responding in all components produced money gains according to a random-interval 20 -s schedule. During punishment conditions, responding during the punishment component conjointly produced money losses according to a random-interval schedule. The value of the response-cost schedule was manipulated across conditions to systematically evaluate the effects on responding of response-cost frequency. Participants were assigned to one of two yoked-control conditions. For participants in <b>the</b> <b>Yoked</b> Punishment group, during punishment conditions money losses were delivered in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> component response independently at the same intervals that money losses were produced in the punishment component. For participants in <b>the</b> <b>Yoked</b> Reinforcement group, responding in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> component produced <b>the</b> same net earnings as produced in the punishment component. In 6 of 8 participants, contingent response cost selectively decreased response rates in the punishment component and the magnitude of the decrease was directly related to the punishment schedule value. Under punishment conditions, for participants in <b>the</b> <b>Yoked</b> Punishment group response rates in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> component also decreased, but the decrease was less than that observed in the punishment component, whereas for participants in <b>the</b> <b>Yoked</b> Reinforcement group response rates in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> component remained similar to rates in the no-punishment component. These results provide further evidence that contingent response cost functions similarly to noxious punishers in that it appears to suppress responding apart from its effects on reinforcement density.

40|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to an {{interlocking}} fixed-ratio 150 fixed-interval 5 -minute schedule of food reinforcement and then to yoked variable-ratio schedules in which individual ratios corresponded exactly to the ratios of responses to reinforcement obtained on the interlocking schedule.

Response rates were highest in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> VR condition and lowest in <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> VI, while intermediate rates characterized the interlocking schedule. Break-run patterns of responding were generated by the interlocking schedule for all subjects, while both <b>the</b> <b>yoked</b> VR and VI schedules produced comparatively stable local rates of responding.
