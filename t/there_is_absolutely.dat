This scenario is uninteresting {{from the point of}} view of this theorem, and physically unrealistic (there will always be wind). In the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that at all times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft. This corresponds to the above statement that there will always be p such that f(p) = 0.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> no {{evidence}} that Gregory was a fool, and much {{to prove that he}} was intelligent and accomplished. Moreover, Gregory Cromwell was not created Baron Cromwell of Oakham by letters patent until December 1540 and did not receive any royal grants before February 1541. His courtesy title of Lord Cromwell was forfeited after his father's arrest, although he did continue to receive the profits from the property alienated to his use and his heirs by his father in November 1538. This property included the manors and lordships of Oakham and Langham (Rutland), Clapthorne, Hackleton and Piddington (Northamptonshire), and Blaston (Leicestershire), with the advowson of Blaston church, and the manors of North Elmham and Beetley (Norfolk). Gregory was still receiving the profits from Langham in April 1541, his entitlement was then being questioned and which was later resolved in his favour.|$|E
25|$|First of all, {{the law of}} the pursuer only {{applies to}} a {{spontaneous}} act, whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, {{the law of the}} pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> no proof that withdrawing from certain territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite—that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and that would mean that Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will continue.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to who is really {{the topic of the}} machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not make much sense to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan of the}} Chapel holds to the Gothic {{tradition}} of the T form, but the proportions of the interior, the arrangement of bays and buttresses outside, and the carving, are distinctly classical. Perhaps it was difficult owing to the disturbed state {{of the country to}} get carvers outside Oxford; in any case he had to use up old material. For some reason or other, perhaps because it contains swags and Classic capitals, it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Certainly he was in Oxford in 1656, not being elected to the Gresham Professorship till 1657, but from then onwards {{he spent most of his}} time in London, and probably did not return till his election to the Savilian Professorship in 1661. It is possible that he was interested in the matter, as an amateur: his father had very strong architectural leanings, and may have imbued his son with like interests: but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> no evidence in support of the theory, nor is there anything to show that he had any interest in architecture before his appointment to the post of Assistant Surveyor General in 1662, when the Chapel was practically completed. Beyond details of carving, there is little resemblance to his work, and the building lacks the unity and feeling for proportion and scale which are the chief characteristics of Wren's style.|$|E

Based on 85 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} a [...] "Rotten" [...] rating from critics, with 19% positive reviews and an average rating of 3.7 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "The inevitable Fatal Attraction comparisons aside, Obsessed is a generic, toothless thriller both instantly predictable and instantly forgettable." [...] Another review aggreatator, Metacritic, gave the film a weighted mean score of 25 out of 100, based on ten reviews from mainstream critics. A common complaint about the film was that, unlike most [...] "deranged stalker"-themed films, Obsessed did not explain why Lisa was so determined to seduce Derek, who showed no interest in her at all. Variety John Anderson and The Hollywood Reporter Kirk Honeycutt criticized Lisa's lack of motive and backstory. Stella Papamichael of Digital Spy called the film predictable and blamed the well-defined morality of the characters. She wrote, [...] "Unlike the bunny-boiling '80s classic Fatal Attraction, the characters are drawn in 2D. They are either good or bad, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> no attempt to understand what drives them either way." [...] Liz Braun from Jam! lambasted the lack of character development in Obsessed and called it [...] "a chemistry-free movie". Jason McKiernan of Filmcritic.com described the film as [...] "so steeped in the formula of the psycho-sexual suspense flick that it works as both a thriller and a comedy" [...] and [...] "very good trash".|$|E
