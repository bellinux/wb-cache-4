5|$|A novel {{adaptation}} of The Fifth Element, written by Terry Bisson, {{was published by}} HarperPrism in 1997. There were rumors after the film's release {{that it would be}} followed by a sequel, tentatively titled Mr. Shadow. In 2011, Besson stated that a sequel was never planned, and that he has no desire <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP {{would not be able to}} finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} in Feyenoord Stadium, Rotterdam, with an {{attendance}} of 39,776. Only nine minutes into the game, Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by 23-year-old reserve goalkeeper Nigel Spink, who had only played one match for the club in five years since joining from Chelmsford. Spink went on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> of his best performances for the club against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce, which included Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Other key players in this Villa side included Tony Morley, Gordon Cowans and Dennis Mortimer.|$|E

This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{a cousin}} {{introduced}} Hu Die to Pan Yousheng (潘有声), a young employee of a Shanghai trading firm. Hu Die was careful about {{her personal life}} and their relationship progressed slowly until autumn 1935, when they announced their impending marriage. Their wedding {{was the most important}} social event in Shanghai of that year. Famous film stars served as bridesmaids and groomsmen, and child stars were their flower girls and page boys. Hu Die was ready to retire from the film industry, as was customary at the time after an actress' marriage, but with her husband's support, she signed a contract with Mingxing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> film per year. She only made one more film under the new contract, before the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the hard-fought Battle of Shanghai completely destroyed Mingxing and other Shanghai studios in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Laird {{began his}} {{football}} {{career as a}} trainee at Plymouth Argyle, progressing through the club's centre of excellence. He spent a total of eight years on the club's books, but only managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> first–team appearance for the club. In 2006, he was loaned out to Tiverton Town, playing a total of 20 games for the club, scoring four times. He was later loaned to Torquay United in September 2007, making two appearances for the side. Another loan spell followed, this time to Stevenage in late 2007. Laird impressed under manager Peter Taylor and signed on a permanent basis {{at the start of}} February 2008 for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation that he was going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E

Having uncovered the truth behind Ross's actions, Diamond pulls a gun on the officer and chases him through the cellars underneath the café. Wounding Ross with one of his bullets, Diamond eventually corners him, only to be shot dead by Johnny – an undercover detective who has successfully infiltrated the gang. Johnny informs Ross that the authorities are already aware of Miles' location and that he {{and the rest of the}} gang will soon be apprehended. Ross returns to his former life as an ordinary beat constable.|$|E

5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but did not want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained {{the rights to the}} United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|Steven Spielberg, {{one of the}} film's {{executive}} producers, {{visited the}} director and the writers during pre-production {{to look over the}} script and the artwork. He provided Favreau with a collection of classic Western films. Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> properly. The films included Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, and Destry Rides Again. Spielberg made several other suggestions: a main enemy alien, Jake's final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien, and that Jake and Ella's first kiss should occur in the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Crowther {{spent nine}} years at his local club Stockport County {{moving through the}} youth system, before making his first team debut for the club on 2 January 2006 in a 2–2 draw against Cheltenham Town, where aged just 17, he came on as a {{substitute}} and was made captain, making him the youngest captain in the club's history. He went on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> other senior appearance for Stockport before the club were approached by Liverpool requesting {{an opportunity to take}} both Crowther and Greg Tansey on trial with a view to take them to a tournament in Milan, and agreed deals with Stockport for both players subject to satisfactory performances from the players at the tournament. The players both went to the tournament and Crowther joined Liverpool on 9 July 2007, with Tansey deciding to stay at Stockport. Crowther featured for the successful Liverpool reserve team during the 2007–08 season. On 18 August 2009, it was confirmed that he had left Liverpool by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> litre of birch syrup.|$|E
5|$|Lilly Wachowski, after {{completing}} her gender transition, {{decided to take}} some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana {{came up with the idea}} of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All My Children. Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> feel connected but also isolated and alone.|$|E

5|$|Saggers was in {{stronger}} form {{following his}} tour to England. On 10 December 1948, Saggers, included in AL Hassett's XI for Test trial matches and benefits, {{as well as}} continuing his career at New South Wales, scored 38 for the latter against Queensland. At the same time, he aided Jack Moroney in his own comeback to cricket at New South Wales by suggesting he subtract three years from his age when he submitted his registration form. Overall in the 1948–1949 season he scored 300runs from nine matches, his highest season total, at 25.00, and taking 21catches and six stumpings. Following the South Africa tour of 1949–1950 he returned to Australia again for one final season from 1950–1951, however played only one match, scoring five runs and taking two catches. Through his entire first-class career of 77appearances from 1939 until 1951, he was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>one</b> century in a tour match against Essex and eight half-centuries for New South Wales, ending with 1,888runs {{at an average of}} 23.89, together with 146catches and 75stumpings.|$|E
