5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or {{that one of them}} offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Automated camera {{technology}} {{might be}} used as in other nations to enforce traffic violations, but some argues that it violates the Constitution's Sixth Amendment, which provides that in “all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to be confronted with <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> against him.”.|$|E
5|$|Göring's body, {{as those}} of the other {{executed}} men, was displayed at the execution ground for <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> of the executions. The bodies were cremated at Ostfriedhof, Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the Isar River.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> less <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> says, and <b>the</b> slower <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> speaks, <b>the</b> {{more control}} they can {{maintain}} {{under the pressure}} of a crafty opponent. The key for a witness is to understand the facts that they believe to be the case and not add additional thoughts to those facts, lest they be used to undermine the testimony. Sticking to the brief known facts is key for <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> making it difficult for the cross-examiner to make <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> appear confused, biased or deceitful. The cross examiner will assume <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> has been told that and begin asking supporting questions about where <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> was, what time it was, what <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> saw, what they said, and sooner or later upon asking again <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> may use a different word that will give the cross-examiner a chance to ask the question again doubtfully and pointedly implying contradiction. <b>The</b> <b>witness</b> will try typically to explain and clarify, which sometimes reveals weakness in <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> statements of fact. Other times <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is just being truthful but undermined for the purpose of casting doubt to the jury and or judge.|$|R

5|$|In Boston, a visibly {{sick man}} from the Netherlands arrives at an office building, only to {{collapse}} and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing <b>the</b> <b>witnesses,</b> another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to leave the building, only to be stopped by Walter (John Noble), who sees the man spray out blood and realizes there is a contagion. The building is quarantined with Walter's son Peter (Joshua Jackson), FBI agent Olivia (Anna Torv), {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> still inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} at 5 Buckingham Gate, Kensington (Adare); at Ashley Place, Westminster (Adare); at Victoria Street, Westminster (Lindsay). There was a ledge 4 inches wide below the windows (Adare); a ledge 1½ inches wide (Lindsay); no foothold at all (Lindsay); balconies 7 feet apart (Adare); no balconies at all (Lindsay). The windows were 85 feet from the street (Lindsay); 70 feet (Lindsay); 80 feet (Home); {{on the third floor}} (Adare); on the first floor (Adare). It was dark (Adare); there was a bright moonlight (Lindsay). Home was asleep in one room and <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> went into the next (Adare); Home left <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> in one room and went himself into the next (Adare).|$|E

50|$|In the US, a {{party has}} {{the option of}} discrediting a witness through {{impeachment}} by cross-examining <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> about facts that reflect poorly on <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> credibility or, in some cases, by introducing extrinsic evidence that reflects negatively on <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> truthfulness or knowledge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> for <b>the</b> Defence (or <b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> for <b>the</b> Defense) is a 1913 melodramatic {{novel by}} A.E.W. Mason. It was adapted by Mason from a 1911 play he had written. In 1919 {{it was made}} into an American silent film <b>The</b> <b>Witness</b> for <b>the</b> Defense {{directed}} by George Fitzmaurice.|$|R
50|$|The {{general rule}} is that the proponent of a witness may not attempt to build up <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> {{credibility}} prior to being impeached. The rationale is that <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is presumed trustworthy. It also speeds proceedings by not spending time bolstering when the other side may not even impeach <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b>|$|R
5|$|A person named Shekhar {{approaches}} Shankar {{and through}} him, he informs Mallikharjun, the local Superintendent of police {{that he is}} the witness of the murder of environmentalist Prakash by Damodar. Damodar influences all <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> including Shekhar before Shankar could arrest him. He later comes to know that Raja Rao's son Bharath, the previous district collector committed suicide along with his wife, who was a friend of Prakash, because of defamation and personal attacks when Bharath tried to stop the power project.|$|E
5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann were two of <b>the</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, who was one of <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
50|$|After opening statements, the plaintiff/prosecution {{calls its}} first <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> plaintiff/prosecution conducts a direct {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> and then defense conducts a cross examination of <b>the</b> same <b>witness.</b> After cross-examination, plaintiff/prosecution {{has the opportunity}} to conduct a redirect examination of <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> If they do, defense is given the chance to recross <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> After either all four types of exams have been conducted or one party abstains from doing redirect or recross respectively, <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> steps down from the stand. This process is then repeated for two more plaintiff/prosecution <b>witnesses.</b> With <b>the</b> conclusion of testimony from <b>the</b> third plaintiff <b>witness,</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff rests. The Defense then calls three <b>witnesses</b> in <b>the</b> same manner described above for the plaintiff/prosecution.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, if the cross-examining party {{seeks to}} {{introduce}} evidence of a felony not involving dishonesty or false statement, its success in impeaching <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> will depend on whether <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is <b>the</b> defendant or not. If <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is defendant, <b>the</b> burden is on the prosecution {{to show that the}} probative value of the impeachment (demonstrating <b>the</b> defendant <b>witness's</b> propensity to lie) outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.|$|R
25|$|The {{court did}} not err in refusing to order {{production}} of a defense alibi <b>witness,</b> where <b>the</b> defense contended that <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> was under subpoena but no evidence was introduced to show that <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> was under subpoena, and no evidence was introduced to show <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> was ever served with a subpoena to testify.|$|R
5|$|In Washington, FBI Division Chief Scott Blevins informs Dana Scully that, {{unbeknownst to}} her, Fox Mulder has {{requested}} travel expenses to Sioux City {{based on a}} tabloid article about Ruby's disappearance. Blevins also shows Scully an X-File on the disappearance of Mulder's sister Samantha. When Scully asks Mulder about the travel expenses, he explains that Lake Okobogee {{was the scene of}} a series of UFO sightings in 1967; Darlene Morris, then a member of a Girl Scout troop, was one of <b>the</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In all {{criminal}} prosecutions, {{the accused}} shall enjoy {{the right to}} a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.|$|E
5|$|It {{is at this}} point, {{with the}} {{questioning}} of Acoli, that the accounts of the confrontation begin to differ (see <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> section below). However, in the ensuing shootout, Trooper Foerster was shot twice {{in the head with}} his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.|$|E
50|$|If a {{statement}} is testimonial, the person making the statement must generally {{be available for}} cross examination. An exception to this rule is if <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is unavailable. But even where <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is unavailable, <b>the</b> defendant {{must have had a}} prior opportunity to confront <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> through cross examination. The latter requirement, cross examination, is discussed below.|$|R
50|$|Van Alden {{tries to}} {{transport}} <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> to New York, {{but he needs}} medical attention en route. At a dentist's office, as <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is dying, Van Alden tortures him until he reports Jimmy Darmody's involvement. Arnold Rothstein learns that <b>the</b> <b>witness,</b> a distant family member, has died, and sends Lucky Luciano to Atlantic City to deal with Darmody.|$|R
50|$|C: The {{interests}} of justice require {{that it is}} important that <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> testifies, and that <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> would not testify if the order were not made.|$|R
5|$|Sunglasses: The first {{sunglasses}} {{were invented}} in 12th century China when medieval Chinese magistrates wore smoke-colored lenses to conceal {{their eyes and}} feelings during trials while questioning <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> and accused. They were a crude slab of smoked quartz that was made {{to block out the}} light from the sun.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Alexandrian text-type, but with a large number of Byzantine readings.

5|$|The final witness {{called for}} the defence was Coventry. He {{was one of the}} non-playing members of the party who had {{witnessed}} no cheating, understood little about gambling and, as a non-soldier, knew nothing of Article 41 of the Queen's Regulations. When cross-examined by Clarke, Coventry confirmed that {{as far as he was}} aware, <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> had all decided to watch Gordon-Cumming's play on the second night, despite their claims to the contrary.|$|E
50|$|Even where <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> is unavailable, <b>the</b> {{defendant}} {{usually has}} a right to cross-examine <b>the</b> <b>witness.</b> An exception to this rule, forfeiture by wrongdoing, is discussed below.|$|R
50|$|It is the prosecution's {{burden to}} prove, by a {{preponderance}} of evidence, that the defendant secured <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> unavailability for <b>the</b> purpose of preventing <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> to testify.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>witness,</b> amidst much laughter, {{was here}} {{severely}} instructed by the Court that the asking of questions {{was not the}} function of a <b>witness.</b> <b>The</b> <b>witness</b> must answer.|$|R
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is cited}} in all critical {{editions of the}} Greek New Testament (UBS3, UBS4, NA26, NA27). In NA27 it belongs to <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> consistently cited of the first order.

5|$|The suspect list {{drawn up}} by Nove's team {{included}} Nicholas Jacobs, who would be tried for the murder and acquitted in 2014, based on the statements gathered during the second investigation.

5|$|A charter {{purporting}} {{to be from}} King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the Textus Roffensis, {{as well as a}} copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century Liber Temporalium. Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a grant of land near the city of Rochester to Justus' church. Among <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 80 FBI agents {{conducted}} {{interviews with}} potential witnesses daily. [...] No verbatim records of <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> interviews were produced; instead, the agents {{who conducted the}} interviews wrote summaries that they then submitted. Witnesses were not asked to review or correct the summaries. Included in some of <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> summaries were drawings or diagrams of what <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> observed. Witnesses {{were not allowed to}} testify at the court hearings.|$|R
50|$|During direct examination, if the {{examining}} attorney who called <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> finds that their testimony is antagonistic or {{contrary to the}} legal position of their client, the attorney may request that the judge declare <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> hostile. If <b>the</b> request is granted, the attorney may proceed to ask <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> leading questions. Leading questions either suggest the answer ("You saw my client sign the contract, correct?") or challenge (impeach) <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> testimony. As a rule, leading questions are generally only allowed during cross-examination, but a hostile witness is an exception to this rule.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they did not condemn {{witnesses}} as perjurers until other <b>witnesses</b> directly incriminated <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses.</b> Thus if <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses</b> testified that one person killed another, and other <b>witnesses</b> testified that <b>the</b> victim or the alleged murderer was with <b>the</b> other <b>witnesses</b> on that day in a particular place, then they did not condemn <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses</b> as perjurers. But if <b>the</b> other <b>witnesses</b> testified that <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses</b> were with <b>the</b> other <b>witnesses</b> on that day in a particular place, then they did condemn <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses</b> as perjurers and executed <b>the</b> first <b>witnesses</b> on <b>the</b> other witnesses' evidence.|$|R
