5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine <b>transaminase</b> and aspartate <b>transaminase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a <b>transaminase.</b> The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A <b>transaminase</b> converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
40|$|What {{antiepileptic}} drugs {{cause elevation}} of liver <b>transaminases?</b> Bottom line: Older antiepileptic medications that induce liver enzyme pathways {{may be associated}} with elevated <b>transaminases,</b> but rarely cause hepatotoxicity (SOR: B, based on cohort studies). Elevation of liver <b>transaminases</b> is unlikely with most new antiepileptic agents (SOR: C, disease-oriented outcomes) ...|$|R
25|$|Physicians should measure <b>transaminases</b> {{periodically}} {{in patients}} receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, <b>transaminases</b> should be monitored within 4 to 8 week after initiating treatment with diclofenac.|$|R
40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor α (TNFα) antagonists {{are effective}} {{for the treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but concerns remain about their safety in the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The influence of treatment with the TNFα antagonist infliximab on levels of HCV viraemia and serum <b>transaminases</b> in a 38 -year-old patient with RA and HCV was examined to assess the safety of the drug. After starting infliximab treatment, the patient’s clinical symptoms improved significantly (28 -joint Disease Activity Score (DAS 28) of less than 3) and levels of <b>transaminases</b> were normal. At the 14 th injection of infliximab, the levels of HCV viraemia and <b>transaminases</b> were significantly elevated. After stopping the infliximab injections, the levels of <b>transaminases</b> returned to normal with infusion of glycyrrhizinate derivatives within 3 months. Evidence is provided of aggravation of serum <b>transaminases</b> and progression of viraemia during treatment with infliximab in a patient with RA and HCV infection...|$|R
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine <b>transaminase</b> in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E
25|$|To further {{elucidate}} {{the causes of}} jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler {{to look at other}} liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine <b>transaminase,</b> aspartate <b>transaminase,</b> gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Vigabatrin is {{also used}} to treat {{seizures}} in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA <b>transaminase</b> inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA <b>transaminase,</b> so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.|$|E
40|$|Glutamine {{metabolism}} {{is largely}} controlled by two enzyme pathways: 1) Conversion of glutamine to glutamate catalyzed by glutaminases, followed by conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate by a glutamate-linked aminotransferases (or by {{the action of}} glutamate dehydrogenase); and 2) conversion of glutamine to α-ketoglutaramate (KGM) catalyzed by glutamine-utilizing <b>transaminases</b> (aminotransferases), followed by conversion of KGM to α-ketoglutarate {{by the action of}} ω-amidase. The former pathway has been well documented and intensively studied for over 60 years, whereas only recently has research focused on the latter pathway, its importance in homeostasis and the control of anaplerotic metabolites. The glutamine <b>transaminases</b> are of fundamental importance 1) as repair enzymes (salvage of α-keto acids), 2) in nitrogen and sulfur homeostasis (closure of the methionine salvage pathway), 3) in 1 -carbon metabolism, and 4) in metabolism of seleno amino acids. As a result of their broad substrate specificity the two principal mammalian glutamine <b>transaminases</b> (i. e. glutamine <b>transaminases</b> L and K) have also been characterized as kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I and KAT III, respectively), responsible for the production of neuroactive kynurenate. The glutamine <b>transaminases</b> are also active with a variety of sulfur- and selenium-containing amino acids. Some of the products derived from the transamination of these amino acids may also be neuroactive (e. g. certain sulfur-containing cyclic ketimines) as well as chemopreventive (e. g. the α-keto acids derived from seleno amino acids). Of relevance to human health and disease, the glutamine <b>transaminases</b> may contribute to the bioactivation (toxification) of halogenated alkenes (and possibly other xenobiotic electrophiles), some of which are environmental contaminants. Finally, the role of the glutamine <b>transaminases</b> and ω-amidase in cancer biology has been little studied. However, the "glutamine addiction" of many tumors suggests that the glutamine <b>transaminases</b> together with ω-amidase may have a fundamental and influential role in regulating cancer progression. 18 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Vigabatrin, {{brand name}} Sabril, is an {{antiepileptic}} drug that inhibits {{the breakdown of}} γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by acting as a suicide inhibitor of the enzyme GABA <b>transaminase</b> (GABA-T).

25|$|The enzyme {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase normally converts {{the amino}} acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. If this reaction {{does not take}} place, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through the minor route, a <b>transaminase</b> pathway with glutamate. Metabolites include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic {{hepatitis}} (also {{known as}} shock liver) results from reduced {{blood flow to}} the liver as in shock, heart failure, or vascular insufficiency. The condition is most often associated with heart failure but can also be caused by shock or sepsis. Blood testing of a person with ischemic hepatitis will show very high levels of <b>transaminase</b> enzymes (AST and ALT). The condition usually resolves if the underlying cause is treated successfully. Ischemic hepatitis rarely causes permanent liver damage.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of valproate is not fully understood, traditionally, its anticonvulsant effect {{has been attributed to}} the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The GABAergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the anti-manic properties of valproate. In animals, sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of the inhibitory synaptic neurotransmitter, GABA, possibly by inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes, such as GABA <b>transaminase,</b> succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the re-uptake of GABA by neuronal cells.|$|E

25|$|An {{elevation}} in serum bilirubin {{level of}} more than 2 times ULN with associated <b>transaminase</b> rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity {{and is likely to}} lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped (Hy's Law). This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or Gilbert syndrome) would not lead to jaundice. Other poor predictors of outcome are old age, female sex, high AST.|$|E
25|$|Vigabatrin was {{developed}} in the 1980s with the specific goal of increasing GABA concentrations in the brain in order to stop an epileptic seizure. To do this, the drug was designed to irreversibly inhibit the GABA <b>transaminase,</b> which degrades the GABA substrate. Although the drug was approved for treatment in the United Kingdom in 1989, the authorized use of Vigabatrin by US Food and Drug Administration was delayed twice in the United States before 2009. It was delayed in 1983 because animal trials produced intramyelinic edema, however, the effects were not apparent in human trials so the drug design continued. In 1997, the trials were temporarily suspended because it was linked to peripheral visual field defects in humans.|$|E
500|$|Wilson's {{disease may}} be {{suspected}} {{on the basis}} of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate <b>transaminase,</b> alanine <b>transaminase</b> and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure. If there are neurological symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is usually performed; this shows hyperintensities in {{the part of the brain}} called the basal ganglia in the T2 setting. MRI may also demonstrate the characteristic [...] "face of the giant panda" [...] pattern.|$|E
40|$|<b>Transaminases</b> are {{valuable}} enzymes for industrial biocatalysis and enable {{the preparation of}} optically pure amines. For these transformations they require either an amine donor (amination of ketones) or an amine acceptor (deamination of racemic amines). Herein <b>transaminases</b> are shown to react with aromatic β-fluoroamines, thus leading to simultaneous enantioselective dehalogenation and deamination to form the corresponding acetophenone derivatives {{in the absence of}} an amine acceptor. A series of racemic β-fluoroamines was resolved in a kinetic resolution by tandem hydrodefluorination/deamination, thus giving the corresponding amines with up to greater than 99 [*]% ee. This protocol is the first example of exploiting the catalytic promiscuity of <b>transaminases</b> as a tool for novel transformations...|$|R
50|$|The liver has <b>transaminases</b> to {{synthesize}} and break down amino acids and to convert energy storage molecules. The concentrations of these <b>transaminases</b> in the serum (the non-cellular portion of blood, also called plasma) are normally low.

With this kind of methodology {{there is no need for}} isolation of intermediates, and thus unnecessary work-up steps can be omitted and formation of waste is prevented. Amine <b>transaminases</b> were successfully combined with other enzymes for multi-step synthesis of valuable products: With ketoreductases all four diastereomers of a 1, 3 -amino alcohol could be obtained, and the use of a lipase allowed for the synthesis of natural products in the form of capsaicinoids. Amine <b>transaminases</b> were also successfully combined with metal catalysts based on palladium or copper. This methodology allowed for the amination of alcohols and the synthesis of chiral amines such as the pharmaceutical compound Rivastigmine. These examples show that the use of amine <b>transaminases</b> in multi-step one-pot reactions is possible, and hopefully this concept can be further developed and applied to make industrial processes more sustainable and efficient in the future.
