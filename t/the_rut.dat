5|$|In feral sheep, rams may fight during <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> to {{determine}} which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and spend most of <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> {{on the periphery of}} larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> males {{establish}} territories, {{ranging from}} , which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight {{for access to}} females, which they do by twisting and levering {{at each other with}} their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.|$|E

5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{elements}} of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 4 - 19 that focused on the aggregate tests related to the permanent deformation and moisture susceptibility of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements. Five coarse and six fine aggregates were used in this research program. The effect of these aggregates on the HMA pavement performance was assessed by constructing and testing test sections in the Indiana Department of Transportation/Purdue Accelerated Pavement Testing (INDOT/Purdue APT) facility located in West Lafayette, Indiana. The relationships between the aggregate properties and the HMA pavement performances were analyzed using statistical and regression analyses. The uncompacted voids content of coarse aggregate was found related to <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of coarse-graded HMA mixtures. The higher the uncompacted voids content value, the higher the resistance of HMA pavements against <b>rutting.</b> <b>The</b> uncompacted voids content of fine aggregates was related to <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of fine-graded HMA mixtures. <b>The</b> <b>rutting</b> resistance increases with the uncompacted voids content of the fine aggregate. This study also observed that the in-place binder film thickness was related to <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of fine-graded HMA pavements. The thicker the binder film, <b>the</b> lower <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> resistance. <b>The</b> methylene blue value (MBV) and the amount of material passing the 0. 075 mm sieve (p 0. 075) of the fine aggregate were related to the stripping potential of fine-graded HMA mixtures. <b>The</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of <b>the</b> fine-graded HMA mixtures under wet conditions was also related to the uncompacted voids content of the fine aggregate. This study also found that the in-place binder film thickness and methylene blue value of p 0. 075 were significantly related to <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of <b>the</b> fine-graded HMA mixtures tested under wet conditions.

5|$|Special {{behavioral}} {{features of}} the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, {{with the exception of}} rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during <b>the</b> <b>rut.</b> Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E

40|$|Rutting {{is one of}} {{the major}} distresses of {{flexible}} pavement. It is defined as the formation of longitudinal depressions along the wheel paths caused by the progressive movement of materials under traffic loading in the asphalt pavement layers or in the underlying base through consolidation or plastic flow. This structural damage has a negative financial impact to the economy. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> behaviour of bituminous materials with different air void contents was investigated. The dynamic cyclic compression testing was carried out to establish nonlinear material models with multiple regression technique. With the specified material models, finite element analysis was carried out to study <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> behaviour of <b>the</b> wearing course materials with different air void contents in a flexible pavement structure. The simulation result shows that <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> depth is small at the air void contents of 4. 5 - 8 % for wearing course materials. However, for the air void contents above or below this range, <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> resistance reduces, and thus <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> depth increases. To verify this simulation result, wheel tracking tests were performed to obtain laboratory data, and the test data was found to be very close to the simulated one. This proved that the developed nonlinear model is applicable to simulate <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of bituminous mixture and it is a convenient and economical method to be used for the design of bituminous mixtures for both new and rehabilitated pavements.

5|$|Sheep {{and goats}} are closely related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> whereas rams do not.|$|E
25|$|Dominant stags follow {{groups of}} hinds during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> from August into early winter. The stags may {{have as many}} as 20 hinds to keep from other, less {{attractive}} males. Only mature stags hold harems (groups of hinds), and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age. Stags two to four years old rarely hold harems and spend most of <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> on the periphery of larger harems, as do stags over 11 years old. Young and old stags that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than those stags in their prime. Harem-holding stags rarely feed and lose up to 20% of their body weight. Stags that enter <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period.|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during <b>the</b> <b>rut,</b> often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the calls made by female moose during <b>the</b> <b>rut</b> not only call the males but can {{actually}} induce a bull to invade another bull's harem and fight for control of it.

40|$|Rutting {{is common}} {{pavement}} distress, {{which leads to}} lower riding comfort for road users and high maintenance costs. One of the commonly used tests is the simulation test with wheel tracking devices. Here, a new rutting test system has been developed based on the “Driving Wheel Pavement Analyzer” (DWPA) to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>rutting</b> performance of asphalt mixtures. This study conducted three types of rutting tests to validate feasibility, reliability, and accuracy of DWPA test.

O. a. polii males have been noted to rise up on their hind legs when they clash with opponents, which is not common in lowland sheep and similar to the fighting habits of goats. The males commonly emit grunts while fighting and often chip their horns or break their noses.|$|E
