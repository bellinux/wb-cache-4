In pathological pregnancies, {{this process is}} incomplete. To define the fundamental events involved in spiral artery remodeling, we have studied the effect of <b>trophoblasts</b> on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Here we demonstrate {{for the first time}} that apoptosis of SMCs can be initiated by invading <b>trophoblasts.</b> When <b>trophoblasts</b> isolated from normal placenta (primary <b>trophoblasts)</b> or conditioned medium was perfused into spiral or umbilical artery segments, apoptosis of SMCs resulted. Culture of human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) with primary <b>trophoblasts,</b> primary trophoblast-conditioned medium, or a trophoblast-derived cell line (SGHPL- 4) also significantly increased SMC apoptosis. Fas is expressed by spiral artery SMCs, and a Fas-activating antibody triggered HASMC apoptosis. Furthermore, a Fas ligand (FasL) -blocking antibody significantly inhibited HASMC apoptosis induced by primary <b>trophoblasts,</b> SGHPL- 4, or trophoblast-conditioned medium. Depleting primary trophoblast-conditioned medium of FasL also abrogated SMC apoptosis in vessels in situ.

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to B. canis-induced abortion are unknown, but heavily infected <b>trophoblasts</b> are consistently observed. As <b>trophoblasts</b> responses to other pathogens contribute to placental inflammation leading to abortion, {{the aim of the}} present study was to characterize the cytokine response of canine <b>trophoblasts</b> to B. canis infection. To achieve this, <b>trophoblasts</b> isolated from term placenta of healthy female dogs were infected with B. canis, culture supernatants were harvested for cytokine determinations, and the load of intracellular viable B. canis was determined at different times post-infection. Additionally, cytokine responses were assessed in non-infected <b>trophoblasts</b> stimulated with conditioned media (CM) from B. canis-infected canine monocytes and neutrophils. Finally, cytokine response and bacteria replication were assessed in canine placental explants infected ex vivo. B. canis successfully infected and replicated in primary canine <b>trophoblasts,</b> eliciting an increase in IL- 8 and RANTES (CCL 5) secretion. Moreover, the stimulation of <b>trophoblasts</b> with CM from B. canis-infected monocytes and neutrophils induced a significant increase in IL- 8, IL- 6 and RANTES secretion. B. canis replication was confirmed in infected placental explants and the infection elicited an increased secretion of TNF-α, IL- 8, IL- 6 and RANTES.

40|$|Abstract. In {{pregnant}} Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus uurutus) used as {{an animal}} model for studying the migration of fetal <b>trophoblasts</b> and the associated changes in maternal blood vessels, intravascular <b>trophoblasts</b> migrated well beyond the blood vessels of the uterus and into the vessels of the mesometrium. They migrated beyond the decidua of the uterus, into the lumina of maternal uterine and mesometrial arteries, but not into veins. The arterial changes, which were often segmental, resembled those seen in the decidua and consisted of a replace-ment of normal smooth muscle cells by poorly differentiated stromal cells. Ultrastructurally, the <b>trophoblasts</b> were either above or below maternal endothelial cells. They occurred also as single or multiple layers within the lumina of arteries that lacked an endothelial lining. Apparent penetration of the elastic membrane by the fetal <b>trophoblasts</b> brought them into close apposition to maternal cells in the arterial wall. Histochemical studies showed heightened metabolic activity of the intravascular <b>trophoblasts</b> as suggested by strong histochemical reactions to nonspecific esterase, succinic dehydrogenase and the glycerophosphate dehydro-genase reactions.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying cellular injury when human placental <b>trophoblasts</b> {{are exposed}} to hypoxia are unclear. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mediates cell injury and fibrosis in diverse tissues. We hypothesized that hypoxia enhances the production of CTGF in primary term human <b>trophoblasts.</b> Using cultured term primary human <b>trophoblasts</b> as well as villous biopsies from term human placentas, we showed that CTGF protein is expressed in <b>trophoblasts.</b> When compared with cells cultured in standard conditions (FiO 2 = 20 %), exposure of primary human <b>trophoblasts</b> to low oxygen concentration (FiO 2 = 8 % or ≤ 1 %) enhanced the expression of CTGF mRNA in a time-dependent manner, with {{a significant increase in}} CTGF levels after 16 h (2. 7 ± 0. 7 -fold; P < 0. 01), reaching a maximum of 10. 9 ± 3. 2 -fold at 72 h. Whereas exposure to hypoxia had no effect on cellular CTGF protein levels, secretion of CTGF to the medium was increased after 16 h in hypoxia and remained elevated through 72 h. The increase in cellular CTGF transcript levels and CTGF protein secretion was recapitulated by exposure of <b>trophoblasts</b> to agents that enhance the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 α, including cobalt chloride or the proline hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine, and attenuated using the HIF 1 α inhibitor 2 -methoxyestradiol. Although all TGFβ isoforms stimulated the expression of CTGF in <b>trophoblasts,</b> only the expression of TGFβ 1 mRNA was enhanced by hypoxia.

40|$|Strategies {{to protect}} against viral infections are {{essential}} during pregnancy. Maternal-fetal transmission can have serious pathological outcomes, including fetal infection, growth restriction, birth defects, and/or death. Throughout pregnancy, the placenta (composed of polarized <b>trophoblasts</b> amid stromal and vascular arrangements) is an indispensable tissue that forms a barrier at the maternal-fetal interface. Viruses have likely evolved specific mechanisms to exploit the protective functions of placental <b>trophoblasts</b> to initiate fetal infection. Despite the severity of pathologic disease associated with fetal viral infection, little is known regarding virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. In this work, we have examined the mechanisms by which – 1) placental <b>trophoblasts</b> protect against invading viruses and 2) coxsackievirus B (CVB), a virus associated with fetal pathology, gains entry into polarized <b>trophoblasts.</b> As a model, we have used cultured primary human <b>trophoblasts</b> (PHTs) and immortalized human (BeWo) <b>trophoblasts.</b> We have found that PHTs are highly resistant to infection by six disparate viruses. PHTs transfer this resistance to non-placental recipient cells through exosome-mediated delivery of select placental microRNAs (miRNAs). We show {{that members of the}} chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C 19 MC), which are almost exclusively expressed in the primate placenta, are packaged within trophoblast-derived exosomes, and attenuate viral replication in recipient cells by inducing autophagy. To study CVB entry into placental <b>trophoblasts,</b> we have merged virological and cell biological techniques, combined with pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs directed against diverse cellular endocytic and signaling components, to characterize the pathways hijacked by CVB to promote its entry into human <b>trophoblasts.</b> We found the kinetics of CVB entry and uncoating in placental <b>trophoblasts</b> similar to those described in polarized intestinal epithelial cells. CVB entry into placental <b>trophoblasts</b> requires decay accelerating factor (DAF) binding, and is associated with the relocalization of virus from the apical surface to intercellular tight junctions. We have identified a divergent mechanism for CVB entry that is independent of clathrin, caveolae, and dynamin II but is dependent on lipid-rafts and Src family tyrosine kinase signaling. Our studies model viral transmission and infection at the maternal-fetal interface, and have the therapeutic potential for preventing prenatal infections, pre-term labor, and birth defects. ...|$|R

Pre-term placentas with histologic chorioamnionitis produced smaller amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL) than those without chorioamnionitis (P< 0 · 001). To examine the mechanism involved in the suppression of placental endocrine func-tions induced by chorioamnionitis, we initially confirmed the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, i. e. the CD 14 molecule, on <b>trophoblasts</b> by Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. We then stimulated purified <b>trophoblasts</b> with LPS, which is the major agent which induces inflammatory responses in the host via the LPS receptor.

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal {{conflict between the}} maternal organism and fetus.

40|$|Mother-to-child {{transmission}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) {{is the leading cause}} of HIV infection in infants. Direct infection of trophoblasts—cells forming the placental barrier—may cause this transmission. Entry of HIV- 1 into <b>trophoblasts</b> is unusual for this retrovirus, because it is associated with endocytosis. However, given that <b>trophoblasts</b> express no or few receptors/coreceptors required for virus internalization, the mechanism underlying this event remains ambiguous. In the present study, we show that HIV- 1 entry and infection of polarized <b>trophoblasts</b> are independent not only of CD 4 but also of envelope (Env) glycoproteins gp 120 and gp 41. Virus internalization, cytoplasmic release, reverse transcription, integra-tion, and HIV- 1 gene expression occurred with both fusion-incompetent and Env-deficient viruses. Importantly, fusion-independent infection was observed when we used viruses produced in a natural cellular reservoir (i. e., primary human cells). Finally, HIV- 1 requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans for uptake in <b>trophoblasts.</b> To-gether, our findings illustrate that HIV- 1 utilizes an unusual pathway for entering human polarized <b>trophoblasts.</b> More than 2 million children are living with HIV- 1 worldwide, and 90 % of these infections resulted from transmission from the mother [1] occurring in utero...|$|R

However, no data are available to address whether trophoblast-related ERBB 2 expression might also be linked to genomic amplification. MethodsDual color silver as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were carried out to evaluate frequency and degree of ERBB 2 gene and chromosome 17 copy numbers in first trimester placental cell columns and isolated <b>trophoblasts.</b> Proliferative EGFR+ and differentiated HLA-G+ <b>trophoblasts</b> were identified or separated by means of in situ immunofluorescence co-stainings and magnetic beads cell isolation, respectively.

Accordingly, HLA-G+ <b>trophoblasts</b> highly express ERBB 2 on protein level. Finally, ERBB 2 copy number variations occur independently of aneuploidy as the majority of ERBB 2 amplifying cells were cytogenetically diploid for chromosome 17.

Results: HLA-G expression was increased in the infected <b>trophoblasts</b> and BeWo cells compared to uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with IL- 10 decreased HLA-G expression compared to infected cells while no change in treatment of uninfected cells compared with uninfected cells.
