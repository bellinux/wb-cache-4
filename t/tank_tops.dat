Subsequent variations on the theme include the monokini, tankini, string bikini, thong, slingshot, minimini, teardrop, and micro.|$|E
25|$|Undergarments are {{generally}} of two types, {{those that are}} worn to cover the torso {{and those that are}} worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments {{are generally}} worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by females today include bras and panties (known in the United Kingdom as knickers), while males often wear briefs, boxer briefs or boxer shorts. Items commonly worn by both sexes include T-shirts, sleeveless shirts (also called singlets or <b>tank</b> <b>tops),</b> bikini underwear, thongs, and G-strings.|$|E
25|$|The {{culture of}} Christmas Island is unique, {{for people of}} many {{different}} ethnicities inhabit the area. The majority of residents are Chinese, but Europeans and Malays reside there as well with small Indian and Eurasian communities too. The main languages of Christmas Island are English and Chinese. Dress is usually modest, and tourists should keep a wrap, such as a sarong or pareo, on hand to cover shorts, bathing suits, and <b>tank</b> <b>tops.</b> It is common to remove shoes when entering a house and to also avoid touching anyone's head.|$|E

25|$|Many outergarments like sundresses, <b>tank</b> <b>tops,</b> {{and formal}} evening wear are {{designed}} to be worn without bras. Fashion writers continue to suggest alternatives to bras or ways of dressing without bras, emphasising that wearing a bra is a matter of choice and not a requirement. Given the discomfort women experience with ill-fitting bras, an increasing number of women, once they are home, are switching to undershirts, jogbras, or nothing at all. Unhappy bra owners have donated thousands of bras to the Braball Sculpture, a collection of 18,085 bras. The organizer, Emily Duffy, wears a 42B and switched to stretch undershirts with built-in bras because standard bras cut her midsection.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E
500|$|An underwire bra (also under wire bra, under-wire bra, or underwired bra) is a {{brassiere}} that utilizes a thin, semi-circular {{strip of}} rigid material fitted inside the brassiere fabric. The wire {{may be made}} of metal, plastic, or resin. It is sewn into the bra fabric and under each cup, from the center gore to under the wearer's armpit. The wire helps to lift, separate, shape, and support a woman's breasts. Many different brassiere designs incorporate an underwire, including shelf bras, demi bras, nursing bras, and bras built into other articles of clothing, such as [...] <b>tank</b> <b>tops,</b> dresses and swimsuits.|$|E

The longitudinal frames at the sides fit into notches cut into the transverse frames, while the ones {{near the bottom of}} the ship are sometimes made continuous between transverse bulkheads. The transverses are connected to the shell plating at heavy angles and with a <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> are cut at the margin plate. Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> plating. Under the <b>tank</b> <b>top,</b> except for notches cut for the bottom and <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> longitudinals, the transverses are much like ordinary floor plates. The deck longitudinals furnish ample strength, even when large hatch openings must be accommodated.|$|R

500|$|In {{a single}} fashion show in 1985, there were two-piece suits with cropped <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> {{instead of the}} usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that resembled bikinis from the front and one-pieces from the back, {{suspender}} straps, ruffles, and deep navel-baring cutouts. Metal and stone jewelery pieces are now often used to dress up look and style according to tastes.

500|$|D'Angelo's {{wardrobe}} {{during the}} tour included <b>tank</b> <b>tops,</b> black leather pants, and boots. Rolling Stones Touré commented {{on one of}} the outings, [...] "The Soultronics begin each show in all black, but beyond that one requirement, each looks completely distinct. One man is in a deacon's robe, another in a long cape with a knit ski cap that says FBI. There’s a feather boa, a few badass leather coats, and Questlove's mighty Afro. There's a P-Funkish freaky flair to the Soultronics' look." [...] In contrast to D'Angelo's performing behind his keyboard when promoting Brown Sugar, his performances were more lively for Voodoo. Tour manager Alan Leeds, who headed James Brown's late 1960s and early 1970s outings, as well as Prince's Purple Rain tour in the mid-1980s, cited The Voodoo Tour as his most memorable gig.|$|E

[...] Malhotra gave her a very young, [...] "girlie" [...] look.

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel said the character had [...] "untapped potential" [...] that appeared ready to be tapped after Dean Winters left the show, and the paper expressed disappointment it was never achieved. In an interview with Orlando Sentinel about the series, New York Police Department Detective Ted Sica said Jeffries' wardrobe was too revealing for a detective, and that the real-life department would not allow her <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> and tight vests: [...] "We don't tolerate that, especially in a sex crimes unit.

500|$|Other {{developments}} in the dance industry occurred {{in response to the}} growing popularity of hip-hop. On the traveling convention circuit there were tap, ballet, and jazz dance conventions, but there were none specifically for hip-hop. The same void existed in dancewear. There was dancewear for tap, ballet, and jazz dancers but none for hip-hop dancers. Monsters of Hip Hop and Nappytabs dancewear were formed to answer to both needs. Nappytabs is the first line of hip-hop dancewear. Because their clothing is made for hip-hop dancers, they do not sell leotards, unitards, tights, or leg warmers. Their line consists of <b>tank</b> <b>tops,</b> shorts, t-shirts, sweat pants, harem pants, and hoodies. Monsters of Hip Hop (MOHH) was founded in 2003 in Baltimore, Maryland by Andy Funk, Becky Funk, and Angie Servant. The convention is dedicated exclusively to hip-hop instruction. Fatima Robinson, Stefan [...] "Mr. Wiggles" [...] Clemente, and Timothy [...] "Popin' Pete" [...] Solomon have taught classes at MOHH in the past.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios. It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers. The video ends as Brown spins, stops and looks off into the distance.|$|E

2500|$|The tankini is a {{swimsuit}} combining a <b>tank</b> <b>top,</b> mostly made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, and {{a bikini}} bottom {{introduced in the}} late 1990s. According to author William Safire, [...] "The most recent evolution of the -kini family is the tankini, a cropped <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> supported by spaghetti-like strings." [...] The tankini is distinguished from the classic bikini by the difference in tops, {{the top of the}} tankini essentially being a <b>tank</b> <b>top.</b> The tankini top extends downward to somewhere between just above the navel and the top of the hips. The word is a neologism combining the <b>tank</b> of <b>tank</b> <b>top</b> {{with the end of the}} word bikini. This go-between nature of tankini has rendered its name to things ranging from a lemonade-based martini (Tankini Martini) to server architecture (Tankini HipThread). This type of swimwear is considered by some to provide modesty closer to that of a one piece suit but with the convenience of a two piece suit, such as not needing to remove the entire suit in order to use a lavatory.|$|R

In just one major fashion show in 1985, there [...] were two-piece suits with cropped <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that are bikinis in front and one-piece behind, suspender straps, ruffles, and daring, navel-baring cutouts.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 fashion {{consultant}} Gok Wan cited a {{broderie anglaise}} top worn by Nadine Coyle {{of the group}} Girls Aloud as evidence that [...] "the folk/boho look is so hot for summer", while Marks & Spencer employed the headline [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] to summarise its summer range, which owed much to the colours and patterns of the early 1970s. At the beginning of June that year fashion writer Carrie Gorman announced that [...] "this week, shopping is about going bright and bold with a boho feel", citing, among other trends, multi-coloured <b>tank</b> <b>tops</b> ("or dress, according to your height") by Harlow, {{said to be the}} favorite label of American actress Rachel Bilson.
