5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt {{returns as}} the main {{character}} throughout The Hunter's Blades Trilogy. In The Thousand Orcs (2002), Drizzt and his friends encounter the powerful orc Obould Many-Arrows, who has employed frost giants to aid him in gaining control of the region. After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the other Companions of <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> have fallen in battle, and he sets off into the wilderness to fight all orcs in vengeance. The Lone Drow (2003) continues this storyline as the still-living Companions protect Mithril Hall from orc attacks {{without the aid of}} Drizzt. He is reunited with his friends in The Two Swords (2003).|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an incendiary bomb in the London Blitz. Despite much lobbying for <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> be rebuilt, the government decided against doing so. The main musical functions of the Queen's Hall were {{taken over by the}} Royal Albert Hall for the Proms, and the new Royal Festival Hall for the general concert season.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{a recall}} vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>To</b> have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.|$|E
5|$|Ms. Miller stops Dr. Cox in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> {{insist that}} she is not crazy, when they are {{interrupted}} by J.D. Cox breaks into a rapid-fire delivery ("The Rant Song") of the litany of annoying things J.D. does, with some help from Janitor. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller that if she can get J.D. to leave him alone, she'll get the tests she wants. Ms. Miller yells at J.D., and an impressed Dr. Cox agrees to schedule a CT scan.|$|E
5|$|Other {{alterations}} and additions {{were made}} during the 17th century, including a modest brick house added onto the west end in 1639, perhaps intended as a home for Sir Alexander's bailiff, as he himself no longer used the hall as his main residence by that time. The house was built at 90° to the timber-framed building, to which it was later joined. During the Civil War Sir Alexander, as a Royalist, was imprisoned and suffered financial hardship. Reduced means eventually forced his heir, John Radclyffe, into selling <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Colonel John Birch in 1662, thus ending more than 300 years of his family's occupation.|$|E

5|$|Public baths {{were built}} {{to the rear}} of the building, {{accessed}} via Cyprus Street. In 1940 the new Stretford Library was opened on King Street, and the public hall was rendered surplus. The building re-opened in March 1949 as the Stretford Civic Theatre, with a well-equipped stage for the use of local groups. After the Stretford Leisure Centre opened in 1977 now Stretford Sports Village, the Cyprus Street Baths wing fell into disuse, and was demolished. The remainder of the building began to fall into disrepair, despite being designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987, until Trafford Council refurbished and converted <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> serve as council offices in the mid-1990s. It was re-opened in 1997, once again named Stretford Public Hall.|$|E
5|$|With 142 Queen's Scouts as Guard of Honour, {{and live}} {{broadcast}} by the BBC (commentator Richard Dimbleby), Baden-Powell House was opened on 12 July 1961 by Queen Elizabeth II. Afterwards, she toured {{the house with}} the Chief Scout and the president of The Scout Association, her uncle Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. A black marble panel with gold lettering was put on the balcony in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> commemorate the event.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The {{first order of}} business was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by the credentials committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the credentials committee caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The credentials committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards down <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> was {{considered}} <b>to</b> be unsympathetic in appearance {{to the local}} countryside, {{it was decided to}} change its exterior. This was designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership. Work on recasing <b>the</b> Dennys <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> make it look more like a French château began in 1989 and was completed in 1991.|$|R
25|$|The {{hall was}} rebuilt and re-opened in 1901. It was in use {{throughout}} World War I; In 1915, David Lloyd George addressed {{a meeting in}} <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> discuss the production of munitions, while in 1919 a Roll of Honour took place there for soldiers who had been decorated for their service during the war. The Bristol Corporation, which became Bristol City Council, bought the building for £65,000 in 1919.|$|E

Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910, {{during the}} first {{annual meeting of the}} Finnish Building Company, the {{membership}} voted to rent the downstairs of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the Finnish Publishing Company, who occupied the basement until the summer of 1912 when it moved to its own building next door. Of note, was the first Finnish-Canadian newspaper Työkansa (The Working People), which was published by the Finnish Publishing Company. Between 1910 and 1914, the basement of the hall also housed several co-operative restaurants and a billiards room.|$|E

Passenger cars grew along with them, first getting longer {{with the addition of}} a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored a single pair of doors at one end of the car in the car's vestibule; compartmentized cars on American railroads featured a long hallway with doors from <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> the compartments.|$|E
25|$|Two of the film's {{characters}} created minor {{waves in}} the media before its release. The first was Don Roritor, which many took to be a jab at producer Lorne Michaels. Michaels is famous for creating Saturday Night Live, and was responsible for bringing the Kids in <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>to</b> television. He is also known for a demeanor that some interpret as detached, and Mark McKinney mirrors his speech patterns almost exactly as the cold-hearted Roritor. However, Michaels produced the film, so he was fully aware of how he was depicted.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, two {{separate}} vigilante groups, the Merchants Committee and the Citizens Committee, {{began to call}} for immediate action to rid the town of the bunco men.
