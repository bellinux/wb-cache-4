25|$|The New England colonies {{were the}} center of early American literature. The revolutionary period {{contained}} political writings by Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. In the post-war period, Thomas Jefferson's United States Declaration of Independence solidified {{his status as a}} key American writer. It was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the nation's first novels were published. With the War of 1812 and an increasing desire to produce uniquely American literature and culture, a number of key new literary figures emerged, perhaps most prominently Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe. In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) started a movement known as Transcendentalism. Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) wrote Walden, which urges resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> organized society. The political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her world-famous Uncle Tom's Cabin. These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography, of which the best known example from this period was Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.|$|E

500|$|In June 1942, Post editor Ben Hibbs became {{supportive}} of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell {{two months to}} complete the works. By October, the Post was worried about Rockwell's progress on the Four Freedoms and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on Freedom of Worship, his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that {{was inspired by the}} phrase [...] "Each according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> his own conscience." [...] His Arlington, Vermont, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the Episcopal Church. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with The Post who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by [...] "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his fez, was too obviously foreign to offend." [...] The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. [...] The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.|$|E

[...] This was met with some resistance, and some detractors labeled him Pelagian for teaching that an unregenerate man could feel such conviction and desire for salvation, even with the influence of the Law and the Holy Spirit. [...] In the same year, responding to Arminius' theological positions, his colleague Petrus Plancius began to openly dispute him. During a gathering of ministers, Arminius insisted he was not teaching anything in contradiction to the Heidelberg Confession and other standards of orthodoxy, that early church theologians held similar views, and that he utterly repudiated the heresy of Pelagianism.

The title of [...] "princeps" [...] had been used by the indigenous peoples of Northern Spain and its use appears in Galician and Cantabrian inscriptions, in which expressions like [...] "Nícer, Príncipe de los Albiones" [...] (on an inscription found in the district of Coaña) and [...] "princeps cantabrorum" [...] (over a gravestone of the municipality of Cistierna, in Leon).
