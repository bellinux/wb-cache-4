5|$|On {{the opening}} day of free agency, Hodgson signed a one-year {{contract}} with the Nashville Predators. Hodgson made the opening night roster of the Predators to begin the 2015–16 season. He was used primarily in a depth role, centering the fourth-line. After posting 8 points in 39 games, Hodgson was placed on waivers by the Predators on January 13, 2016. Hodgson passed through waivers unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals the following day. Hodgson was not offered a new contract by the club, and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On October 3, it was announced that Hodgson had retired and would be working within the Predators organization, coaching for <b>their</b> <b>Little</b> Preds Learn to Play Program.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{a series}} of {{newspaper}} supplements in late 1928, Wallez founded a supplement for children, Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), which subsequently appeared in Le Vingtième Siècle every Thursday. Carrying strong Catholic and fascist messages, many of its passages were explicitly anti-semitic. For this new venture, Hergé illustrated L'Extraordinaire Aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet), a comic strip authored {{by one of the}} paper's sport columnists, which told the story of two boys, one of <b>their</b> <b>little</b> sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé was unsatisfied, and eager to write and draw a comic strip of his own. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium—such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter Léon Degrelle, stationed there to report on the Cristero War.|$|E
5|$|Hypnotized, {{released}} in Britain as A Quack Hypnotist, is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on May Smalley and Jack, who loves her, who attend a traveling show that comes to <b>their</b> <b>little</b> town. The show consists of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician and proves to be a popular show, but the hypnotist who is becomes interest in May. The hypnotist lures May away by telling her {{that he has a}} message for her from the spirit world and later gets her to leave town with him. Jack knocks the magician down and takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May back to their hotel, where he rescues her. Aside from William Russell's role in the film, the production and cast credits are unknown. The film was released on December 30, 1910, it was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to <b>their</b> <b>little</b> island and go to sleep.|$|E

25|$|Before they tackled Shostakovich's work, Eliasberg had {{the players}} go through {{pieces from the}} {{standard}} repertoire—Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov—which they also performed for broadcast. Because the city was still blockaded at the time, the score was flown by night in early July for rehearsal. A team of copyists worked for days to prepare the parts despite shortages of materials. At rehearsal, some musicians protested, not wanting to waste <b>their</b> <b>little</b> strength on an intricate and not very accessible work.

25|$|Michael Faraday, in {{his essay}} The Chemical History of a Candle (1860), {{suggested}} that the raisins in Snap-dragon act like miniature wicks.

Nevertheless, children often burnt <b>their</b> <b>little</b> hands or mouths playing this game, which may have led to the practice mostly dying out in the early 20th century. In some families, this tradition continues to be practiced and enjoyed even into the 21st century.|$|E

Griffith D. Compton donated his land to incorporate and create the city of Compton in 1889, but he did stipulate that a certain acreage be zoned solely for agriculture and named Richland Farms. In January 1888, a petition supporting the incorporation of Compton was forwarded to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who in turn forwarded the petition to the State Legislature. On May 11, 1888 the city of Compton was incorporated with a population of 500 people. The first City Council meeting was held on May 14, 1888.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} points made by dam expansion opponents is that raising the dam will not create more water (in fact it will actually cause some water loss due to evaporation) but merely increases the capacity to store it. As a result, the reservoir will rarely be filled, as no matter how much Reclamation expands the dam, the river's flow will not increase. The cost of the dam raise is projected at $500 million-$1 billion. One of the expansion's most staunch opponents is the Winnemem Wintu tribe, almost all of whose land was inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. Raising the dam would destroy much of <b>their</b> <b>little</b> remaining land.|$|E
25|$|During June 1990, Graney, Hayward and Moore {{travelled}} to London {{and recorded}} I Was the Hunter... and I Was the Prey with Blair on bass guitar, Ross on guitar, and Vause on piano. The album {{was produced by}} Vinall at a Croydon home studio run by former Procol Harum organist Matthew Fisher. The cover by Western shows Graney with full 'Hickock' curled moustache and velvet pomp. It was not issued until May 1992, due to problems with the label, under the name Dave Graney with the Coral Snakes. In mid-1991, the band had moved back to Melbourne with a line-up of Blair, Graney, Moore, and Hayward; with Robin Casinader on keyboards (ex-the Wreckery). In July 1992, they released a live album, Lure of the Tropics on the Torn & Frayed label on Shock Records. It was recorded at St Kilda's Prince of Wales Hotel. A week earlier the group had performed <b>their</b> <b>Little</b> Big Horn Show and first presented the title track.

25|$|On November 18, 1678, {{after just}} over a month of {{preparations}} at Fort Frontenac, La Salle dispatched Captain La Motte and Father Louis Hennepin together with 15 men and supplies in a vessel of 10 tons. Their mission was to begin selecting a site {{for the construction of}} Le Griffon and to erect necessary structures for shelter, storage, and defense. Because the wind was strong from the north, they sailed close to the north shore of the lake, putting in for the nights in various bays along the way. Somewhere near present-day Toronto they were frozen in and had to chop {{their way out of the}} ice. From there they struck out across the lake toward the mouth of the Niagara River. They arrived late on December 5, but the weather was rough and they did not want to run the surf and outflow of the river at night, so they stayed a few miles off shore. On December 6, they landed safely on the east bank of the river at about where Lewiston, New York is today. They attempted to sail further upstream, but the current was too strong. Ice flowing down the river threatened to damage <b>their</b> <b>little</b> brigantine and after a cable was broken, they hauled the vessel ashore and into a small ravine for protection.|$|E
