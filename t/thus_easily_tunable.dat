40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new access method to {{efficiently}} retrieve the trajectories of objects moving in networks. Its structure is based on a combination of data partitioning and indexing with composite B +-trees. This permits exploiting the availability, robustness and high performance of built-in index structures in existing systems. This method can be easily integrated in any RDBMS or ORDBMS, which is an essential aspect particularly for industrial or commercial applications. Unlike the existing approaches, our approach relies on the expected query size and on the data size to be indexed, which can be known in advance or estimated giving the fact that we deal with historical data. <b>Thus,</b> it is <b>easily</b> <b>tunable</b> and adapts to any spatial distribution of moving object trajectories. The experimental evaluation under an off-the-shelf DBMS show that our approach significantly outperforms a classical 2 D R-tree based method...|$|R

Non-restrictive conditions for the controller coefficients are derived, under which the solutions are described by a $C_ 0 $-semigroup of contractions, and are asymptotically stable. Moreover, by applying Huang's theorem we can finally even show that under these conditions the controller renders the closed-loop system exponentially stable...|$|R

We consider a simple trilayer architecture, with the outer layers acting as the source and drain and the middle layer floating. Under bias, the middle layer can be either resonant or non-resonant with the source and drain layers.
