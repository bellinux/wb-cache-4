5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range on}} the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, {{were thought to be}} extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.|$|E

25|$|Researchers from Kumamoto University {{also began}} to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were {{clustered}} in fishing hamlets along the shore of Minamata Bay. The staple food of victims was invariably fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of food poisoning, with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.|$|E
25|$|Monozygotic twins, {{although}} genetically very similar, are not genetically {{exactly the}} same. The DNA in {{white blood cells}} of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have {{on the order of}} one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome.

25|$|Research {{suggests}} that Dolichovespula queens including D. sylvestris queens mate only once or have most sperm fertilizing eggs {{come from a}} single mate. The characteristics in this species of the queens having one mate, only 1-2 queens producing eggs in a nest, and {{a high level of}} worker policing indicates individuals in the nest will be very closely related. One study estimated that the relatedness among workers was 0.68 with data collected from 10 nests of twenty workers and the queen from each. This value was calculated by analysis at 3 DNA microsatellite loci which allowed <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> determine if males were queens’ or workers’ sons. Then using a computer program, relatedness among individuals in the nest was able to be estimated. This high level of relatedness between wasps in the nest is likely what explains the eusocial behavior in this species.|$|E
25|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial (or randomized control trial; RCT) {{is a type}} of scientific (often medical) experiment which aims to reduce bias when testing a new treatment. The people participating in the trial are randomly allocated to either the group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a group receiving standard treatment (or placebo treatment) as the control. Randomization minimises selection bias and the different comparison groups allow <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> determine any effects of the treatment when compared with the no treatment (control) group, while other variables are kept constant. The RCT is often considered the gold standard for a clinical trial. RCTs are often used to test the efficacy or effectiveness of various types of medical intervention and may provide information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. Random assignment of intervention is done after subjects have been assessed for eligibility and recruited, but before the intervention to be studied begins.|$|E
25|$|As black colored wolves occur more {{frequently}} in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundra), melanism was concluded by <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> give those wolves an adaptive advantage. The mutation’s purpose {{has not yet been}} identified. Dr Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and {{there is no evidence that}} a black coat color leads to any increase in hunting success rates. Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves. A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in ten pups with dark fur out of a total of fourteen.|$|E

25|$|One of Boring's best-known {{projects}} is his 1940 {{study of the}} moon illusion. Boring and fellow researcher A. H. Holway hypothesized that the moon appears larger on the horizon because the eyes view it directly at a leveled position, while the moon overhead appears smaller because the eyes must look up. They tested this experimentally, and found that for an observer whose eyes were kept in a fixed position while a circle representing the moon moved up (through {{the use of a}} pulley system), the moon appeared to increase in size. This illusion did not occur when participants were lying down while viewing the moon, and they also found some evidence of it not occurring when viewing the moon with only one eye. These results led <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the illusion of moon shrinkage depends on the movement of the eyes in the head, not the movement of the actual head, and that it depends on binocular vision, that is, the use of both eyes together. This study exemplifies Boring’s interest in misperceptions of sensory experience.|$|E
25|$|Most Dolichovespula species {{including}} D. media mate {{only once}} or fertilize most eggs with sperm {{from a single}} male. In addition, there are only 1-2 queens per colony. These specific characteristics result in {{a high level of}} worker-worker relatedness within the colony. One study estimated this relatedness to be as high as 0.71. This was determined by analyzing 20 workers from each of 10 nests at 3 DNA microsatellite loci. The DNA analysis allowed <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> determine if males were queen’s or workers’ sons and from there calculate an estimated relatedness. There is evidence that workers in this species attempt to reproduce with about 4 reproducing workers per colony that sometimes lay eggs, however, only 7.4% of the male population are produced by the workers. It has been observed that the median wasp participates in worker policing where the queen or other workers throw worker laid eggs out of the nest or otherwise destroy them. All of this information helps to explain the high level of relatedness in the colony and that relatedness helps to explain the eusocial behavior of these wasps.|$|E
25|$|Queer {{theory is}} a field of post-structuralist {{critical}} theory {{that emerged in the}} early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Applications of queer theory include queer theology and queer pedagogy. Queer theorists, including Rod Ferguson, Jasbir Puar, Lisa Duggan, and Chong-suk Han, critique the mainstream gay political movement as allied with neoliberal and imperialistic agendas, including gay tourism, gay and trans military inclusion, and state- and church-sanctioned marriages for monogamous gay couples. Puar, a queer theorist of color, coined the term homonationalism, which refers to the rise of American exceptionalism, nationalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy within the gay community catalyzed in response to the September 11 attacks. Many studies have acknowledged the problems that lie within the traditional theory and process of social studies, and so choose to utilise a queer theoretical approach instead. One such study was conducted in Melbourne in 2016 by Roffee and Waling. By using queer and feminist theories and approaches the researchers were better equipped to cater for the needs, and be accommodating for the vulnerabilities, of the LGBTIQ participants of the study. In this case, it was a specifically post-modern queer theory that enabled <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> approach the study with a fair perspective, acknowledging all the varieties of narratives and experiences within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{methodology}} of practitioner-based enquiry this paper examines the conception, pre-production and production {{of a collection of}} interactive, new media poems. Blaikie, in Approaches to Social Enquiry, provides a summary of methodological approaches in an “attempt to highlight the complex range of choices which any <b>researcher</b> needs <b>to</b> make” (1993, p. 215). These alternative positions indicate ontological and epistemological assumptions, the relationship of <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> object of study, and the aim of the research. Blaikie goes to some lengths to deflect criticism of the dualism of his summary there is still “a fundamental choice to be made by <b>the</b> social <b>researcher,</b> a choice between very different ontological (realist v. constructivist) and epistemological (outside v. inside) positions” (Blaikie 1993, p. 203).

25|$|Jean Macfarlane {{founded the}} University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development, {{formerly}} called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927. The Institute {{was instrumental in}} initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities. The studies looked at human development during the Great Depression and World War II, unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development {{of children in the}} Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. Jean Macfarlane launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds. These studies provided the background for Glen Elder in the 1960s, to propose a life-course perspective of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of human agency asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.|$|E

2500|$|A bronze {{church bell}} with a relief Medieval Greek text, {{considered}} by Bulgarian researchers {{to be among}} the oldest extant church bells in Europe, was unearthed in Melnik in the 2000s.

The text is thought to reference Alexius Slav, thus it is dated to his rule and the construction of the bell tower. A very similar bell, also found in Melnik, bears an inscription which mentions Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) and the year 1270 specifically. However, this second bell may not have belonged to the Church of St Nicholas, but rather to another church in Melnik.|$|E
