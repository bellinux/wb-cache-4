The researcher guided the collection and analysis of the data with the phenomenologicallifeworld existentials of body, space, time, and human relation (Van Manen, 1990). Individual interviews were conducted with each youth, and group interviews were conducted with each triad (a youth, their parent(s), and their teacher) to discuss <b>the</b> youth's <b>friendships</b> and <b>the</b> supports necessary to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>friendships.</b> Through phenomenological analysis of the data, four thematic statements emerged: friendships are far from perfect, to have a friend {{you have to be a}} friend, parents as choreographers of friendship, and teachers as reluctant partners in friendship facilitation.

In case of the serious problems of friendships, it is necessary for parents and teachers to intervene the problems directly. However, our researches suggest that, in normal situations, it is also important for parents and teachers to give regard to the students'growth among friends, and to give effects to <b>the</b> <b>friendships</b> indirectly...|$|R

Variability in responses to questions about beliefs and expectations in both same- and cross-gender friendships was examined to investigate three theoretically derived hypotheses: (1) cross-gender and same-gender friendships are different types of personal relationships, (2) distinctions between same- and cross-gender conceptions vary across age, and (3) conceptions vary as a function of <b>the</b> <b>friendships</b> of girls versus <b>the</b> <b>friendships</b> of boys. <b>The</b> strongest support was obtained for the first hypothesis, although some support was obtained for <b>the</b> notion that <b>friendships</b> involving girls are viewed to differ stereotypically from friendships with boys.
