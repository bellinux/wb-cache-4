5|$|In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> USAF {{need for an}} interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing.

The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E

When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according to the Star Tribune, of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes needed to win the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union. The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race. His campaign manager, Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E

5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors {{the plot of the}} 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman in the role of Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa.

5|$|HMS Swordfish was {{developed}} <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> requirement of Royal Navy's Submarine Committee {{for a large}} submarine capable of operating with the fleet at a surfaced speed of 20 knots. Most of the earlier British submarines had been single-hulled vessels built by Vickers, and the Navy was interested in evaluating other designs. Captain Roger Keyes, Inspecting Captain of Submarines, had previously served as naval attaché in Italy and had kept abreast of Italian submarine developments, which notably included double-hulled submarines designed by Cesare Laurenti of Fiat-San Giorgio. Three boats of the S class were ordered first and Laurenti was invited to submit a design to meet the RN requirement.|$|E

5|$|M-139 was {{designated}} as a state trunkline by 1931 from US31 at Scottdale to US12 in Benton Harbor. In late 1953 or early 1954 M-139 was extended westward along US12 and then northward along Paw Paw Avenue <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>a</b> new bypass routing of US31 north of Benton Harbor. US31 was rerouted to follow {{what is now the}} I-196 freeway in 1963. At that time, US31 was then routed along I-94 and M-139 to Scottdale. The following year, the concurrency was removed when M-139 was truncated to end at I-94/US31. The northern extension on Paw Paw Avenue was turned back to local control, truncating the northern end of M-139 to the intersection with BL I-94 (previously US12).|$|E
