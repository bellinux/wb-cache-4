50|$|In static <b>timing</b> <b>analysis,</b> {{the word}} static {{alludes to the}} fact that this <b>timing</b> <b>analysis</b> is carried out in an input-independent manner, and purports to find the {{worst-case}} delay of the circuit over all possible input combinations. The computational efficiency (linear in the number of edges in the graph) of such an approach has resulted in its widespread use, even though it has some limitations. A method that is commonly referred to as PERT is popularly used in STA. In fact, PERT is a misnomer, and the so-called PERT method discussed in most of the literature on <b>timing</b> <b>analysis</b> refers to the critical path method (CPM) that is widely used in project management. While the CPM-based methods are the dominant ones in use today, other methods for traversing circuit graphs, such as depth-first search, have been used by various timing analyzers.|$|E
