500|$|The {{song was}} played by Madonna {{as a part}} of the promotional campaigns for the Confessions on a Dance Floor album, in London's night clubs, {{including}} the Koko Club and G-A-Y. During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced [...] "Ladies and Gentleman! <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun." [...] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour. Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses. As the final chorus approached, Madonna went to the front of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna swiveling around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine. The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off. In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Jump" [...] was sampled in the song [...] "Into the Groove" [...] during which Madonna performed stunts in the air.|$|E

"We {{will lay}} your advice to heart; and we <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> meanwhile, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> {{to see us}} in this foul den, which I dislike less because of {{moisture}} and dirt--these being familiar to me--than because of the lively reptiles which hold their nightly revels in it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, it wasn't. The {{lawyers were}} all wrong about it. As far as I can see, lawyers always are wrong. About those nine lacs of rupees for the Sawab, Finlay was all wrong.

Despite being ahead {{on two of}} three judges' scorecards after six rounds, he told his corner he could not go on due to an injury he had sustained in training. The Belfast boxer took the microphone and revealed this might be his swansong.

I would especially like to thank Dr. Tanja Karp for her guidance and willingness to always discuss any questions I had. I {{would also like to}} thank my wonderful parents whose love and support has been constant and unwavering. My in-laws have also been great to me throughout this dissertation. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> all the encouragement, but most of all <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>coming</b> close to my computer while I finished!! I thank God for giving me the wonderful opportunity and experience I had at Texas Tech, and for providing wisdom and encouragement when I needed it most. Lastly and most importantly I would like to thank my loving wife. Her support and encouragement was crucial in me finishing this dissertation. Her patience with me while I spent the late nights was unbelievable. <b>Thank</b> <b>you.</b> I owe you one!...|$|R

It was very kind, as you always are.' Mr. Bernard took the hint, rose, bowed, and retired.|$|R

Many of these individuals have been imprisoned, tortured, or killed for their political beliefs.

PRIVILEGED TO SERVE THE SOCIETY I became a member of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) in 1995, 2 years after its foundation. By searching through the ESTS archives handed over to me by Detlev Branscheid, I came across my own application form as it was transmitted by fax to the secretariat in Heidelberg (Fig. 1). My sponsors were Toni Lerut and Jean-Marie Wihlm, the first and the second treasurer of this society, respectively. The signature of Jean-Marie was still missing and I do not know whether he has ever completed my form. So I may not have been a full ESTS member at all…. !

I want to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> all <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to this conference and to acknowledge that traveling at all, let alone to D. C., is not easy for many of us these days. We aren’t used to thinking about coming to a NASPAA conference as a high-risk activity (although {{in the past four years}} I’ve been through a hurricane in Miami and a traffic accident in Boise). Your presence is a real statement of your commitment to this organization and to the field. I want to talk to you today about some of the challenges facing both the practice and the teaching of public administration and public affairs that have helped shape my priorities <b>for</b> the <b>coming</b> year and that are shaping the planning for next year’s conference in Los Angeles. I have been spending a fair amount of time thinking about two challenges and two concepts.

There {{was still}} in his face {{something}} of savagery,--an expression partly of anger and partly of resolution to tame the thing with which he was angry. Violet did not regard the anger half so keenly as she did that resolution of taming. An angry lord, she thought, she could endure, but she could not bear the idea of being tamed by any one.|$|E

6000|$|Entering the house, Mr. Staples {{led the way}} to the dining-room, {{where there}} was a large empty table {{in the middle of the}} room, and in the deep bay of the window a smaller one, laid out with wine and dessert, where sat 'old Fulbert.' Having always heard him so called, the {{brothers}} were surprised to find him no more than elderly. He must have been originally a thorough florid handsome Underwood, and had the remains of military bearing, though with an air of feebleness and want of health, and a good deal of asthmatic oppression on his breath. He did not rise, but held out his hand, saying, 'Good evening. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to see a sick man.' ...|$|E

[...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> so much <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico...
