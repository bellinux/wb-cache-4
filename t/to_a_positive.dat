5|$|Development {{began in}} July 2006 after work was {{completed}} on Titan Quest, with preparatory work beginning prior to this. Staff members returned while assuming different roles {{to the original}} game: Michael Verrette produced, Michael Sheidow acted as art director, the script was written by Dean O'Donnell, while Arthur Bruno took over as main designer. Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. The concept was to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay experience. It also went for a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> critical reception and favorable sales.|$|E

5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} {{treasure}} Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty {{writes that the}} figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that Morgan left away {{with the majority of}} the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> welcome from the town's inhabitants.

5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> reception.

Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|Quadrophenia was {{released}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> reception {{in both the}} UK and the US, but the resulting tour was marred with problems with backing tapes replacing the additional instruments on the album, and the stage piece was retired in early 1974. It was revived in 1996 with a larger ensemble, and a further tour occurred in 2012. The album made {{a positive impact on}} the mod revival movement of the late 1970s, and the resulting film adaptation, released in 1979, was successful. The album has been reissued on compact disc several times, and seen a number of remixes that corrected some perceived flaws in the original.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of}} the Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E

5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{was written by}} Josh Mancell from Mutato Muzika, while the sound effects were created by Universal Sound Studios (consisting of Mike Gollom, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears). The {{characters}} were designed by Charles Zembillas of American Exitus, Incorporated. Clancy Brown provided the voice of Doctor Neo Cortex, while Brendan O'Brien voiced the dual role of Crash Bandicoot, Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nitrus Brio and Vicki Winters voiced Coco Bandicoot. The game was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> response from the game industry. The game went into the alpha stage in August 1997. Around that time, Dan Arey, the lead designer of , joined Naughty Dog and streamlined the level design. A death animation in which Crash is squashed into a stunned head and feet was altered for the Japanese version of the game due to its resemblance to the severed head and shoes left by a serial killer loose in Japan at the time.|$|E
5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E

25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal substitutionary view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses on the moral change of people, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal substitutionary paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death on our behalf, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> final judgment based on what Christ has done for us and our trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that we ourselves possess.|$|E
