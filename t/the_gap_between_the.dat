5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day.

5|$|On July 1, 1919, the M-65 {{designation}} {{was used}} on two, discontinuous {{roads in the}} southern part of the Lower Peninsula. The southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area in Monroe County; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the original M-65 was redesignated as part of US23.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the M-83 {{designation}} {{was used}} for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The Thumb area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two roads was eliminated within a year. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing The Thumb area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, {{even though it is}} part of the main route.|$|E

5|$|The current {{designation}} {{was assigned}} in 1929 as a second, disconnected section of highway. This new routing ran from US10/US23 in Clio {{by way of}} Frankenmuth to Reese. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sections was filled in a year later when M-84 in Tuscola County was redesignated as part of M-83. After this change, M-83 continued north from Reese through Gilford and Akron to Unionville. There it ran concurrently along M-29 to Bay Port, connecting the two segments.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of I-94 in the Port Huron {{area was}} dedicated on October 14, 1964, signaling {{the completion of}} the highway between Marysville and the Blue Water Bridge.
