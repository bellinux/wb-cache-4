5|$|Capcom {{discovered}} a few business principles through {{their experience with}} development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of US$103 million for fiscal year 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. Resident Evil 4 was a case in point, beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions {{by the time of}} its 2005 release. The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; Resident Evil 4 was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. <b>To</b> <b>wit,</b> Viewtiful Joe 2 started development shortly after the release of Viewtiful Joe and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a cooperative gameplay mode. Viewtiful Joe 2 debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.|$|E

50|$|Say Anything is a {{board game}} {{designed}} by Dominic Crapuchettes and Satish Pillalamarri. It {{was released by}} North Star Games in 2008 as a follow up <b>to</b> the award-winning <b>Wits</b> & Wagers. Say Anything is very similar <b>to</b> <b>Wits</b> & Wagers except players answer open-ended subjective questions instead of trivia questions. The goal of Say Anything is to get people talking about interesting things and laughing.|$|R

25|$|While Lois {{had started}} to become {{suspicious}} of Superman's secret identity during the Golden Age (as early as Superman #7 in 1940), her suspicions reached their peak during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. <b>To</b> <b>wit,</b> various stories from this era show Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his Superman robots or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.|$|E
25|$|Soviet espionage succeeded most in {{collecting}} scientific and technologic intelligence about advances in jet propulsion, radar and encryption, which impressed Moscow, but stealing atomic secrets was the capstone of NKVD espionage against Anglo–American science and technology. <b>To</b> <b>wit,</b> British Manhattan Project team physicist Klaus Fuchs (GRU 1941) {{was the main}} agent of the Rosenberg spy ring. In 1944, the New York City residency infiltrated top secret Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico by recruiting Theodore Hall, a 19-year-old Harvard physicist.|$|E

25|$|In McOndo narratives, {{cities and}} city life are realistically portrayed as places and {{circumstances}} rendered virtual ("non-places") by the technologies of the Internet, cellular telephones, and cable television; virtual space has supplanted physical {{space in the}} city. <b>To</b> <b>wit,</b> the writer Ana María Amar Sánchez said that cities have become interchangeable, homogeneously indistinguishable from each other, especially when seen from a distance, whilst riding in a speeding automobile travelling a highway {{en route to a}} shopping center; seen so, the city appears virtual, an image in the screen of a computer or a television set.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{there is}} the class of persons to whom the term notary is {{restricted}} in common parlance, <b>to</b> <b>wit,</b> those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private persons and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order {{that they may be}} within easy reach of private individuals; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.|$|E
25|$|The {{cathedral chapter}} {{was founded in}} 834 and its members, the canons (Domherr) enjoyed {{personal}} immunity from jurisdiction of the secular local rulers. The chapter wielded the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the North Elbian part of the archdiocese, <b>to</b> <b>wit</b> Hamburg, Ditmarsh, Holstein, and Stormarn. Thus until the breakthrough of the Reformation the chapter appointed the priests serving in the city's parishes. Cathedral, chapter and canonry were maintained by numerous prebends comprising urban real estate and feudal dues and soccage collected from dependent farmers in many so-called capitular villages in the afore-mentioned areas. Holsatian aristocracy and Hamburg's patriciate provided {{for most of the}} canons.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Wu {{became a}} {{director}} {{in his own}} right. His directorial debut, Wrath of the Sword, was released the same year. In 1971, Wu released one of his seminial works, The Deaf And Mute Heroine. He concentrated on directing in the 1970s, directing several movies – such as Young Tiger (1973) and <b>Wits</b> <b>To</b> <b>Wits</b> (1974). <b>Wits</b> <b>To</b> <b>Wits</b> has been noted {{as one of the}} precursors of the knockabout comedy kung fu genre that was later made famous by Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan. Another movie Wu directed, Manchu Boxer (1974), featured Sammo Hung, then a young choreographer and later one of the trend-setters of Hong Kong cinema. This marked the beginning of a strong working relationship between the two, which would become prominent towards the 1980s. He co-directed with his former mentor Chang in several movies – The Water Margin (1972), The Pirate (1973), All Men Are Brothers (1975) and The Naval Commandos (1976).|$|R

25|$|One such {{dialogue}} of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, {{and one of}} Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue can be taught. Socrates responds by stating {{that he does not}} know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; <b>to</b> <b>wit,</b> he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.|$|E
25|$|The {{incorporation}} {{was conducted}} incognito to foreign nations, including Korea, as the decision {{had never been}} announced by the central government to the international community. The Korean response to reports of the verbal notice by a local Japanese official were shock and disbelief, and orders were issued to investigate {{the truth of the}} report. While the result of the investigation is obscured in silence, apparently lending momentum to the Japanese claim, the Japanese Resident-General residing in Seoul, in 1906, makes an inquiry into which islands are administered by Ulleungdo (sic.), in the older designation prior to the 1900 Korean Imperial Decree No 40, to which the Internal Ministry relays facts consistent with the 1900 Imperial Decree No 41, <b>to</b> <b>wit</b> Uldo County administers Uldo proper, Jukdo, and Seokdo.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 a {{concordat}} {{was entered}} into between the Holy See and Portugal, pending {{the execution of}} which both the vicars Apostolic and the authorities of the diocese were to enjoy pacific possession of the places they actually held. But the Crown of Portugal undertook manifestly too great a burden, <b>to</b> <b>wit,</b> {{to provide for the}} spiritual needs of the whole of India, and consequently the concordat remained a dead letter. In 1854 the Royal Missionary College of Bomjardim at Sernache, Portugal was founded for the training of secular priests for the Portuguese missions beyond the seas. Meanwhile the missions of the diocese had been greatly weakened by secessions to the vicars Apostolic. The missions were situated in British territory and as beyond the clergy there were scarcely any Portuguese subjects to be found throughout the diocese there was no particular inducement or the people to cling to the see.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the Paulist Fathers assumed {{responsibility}} for the parish until this reverted temporarily to the archdiocese in 1969. Since 1973 {{responsibility for}} Holy Trinity Catholic Church has belonged to the Jesuits. The parish's Jesuits also run the Catholic chaplaincies <b>to</b> <b>Wits</b> University and the University of Johannesburg, and as such they minister to the spiritual needs of Catholic students at these institutions.|$|R

25|$|Progressive {{educational}} and political philosophies changed religion’s {{role in the}} education imparted. During the 18th century, most universities were strongly connected to either a Catholic or a Protestant church, thus the professors’ and the students’ religion determined employment and matriculation. In the 19th century, religion was deleted from the “compulsory curriculum”; in France, Napoleon’s secular Université de France troubled Roman Catholics, because it threatened their educational monopoly. <b>To</b> <b>wit,</b> the Loi Falloux (Falloux Law) of 1850 attempted to reinstate some educational power to the Roman Catholic Church, but, by then, the Université de France had de facto substantive control of French higher education. Like-wise, in the UK, the new universities (i.e. the University of London), were non-denominational, and the Oxford Act of 1854 rid Oxford and Cambridge universities of required religion with a concomitant decline in chapel attendance, and of religion as integral to a university education.|$|E

He also attended the “Merciless Parliament” on 3 February 1388 where he received a writ of supersedeas omnino noted above.

The form of oath to state that they shall keep the peace, and shall with all their might oppose any who do the contrary, that they shall to the end of this parliament side with the five following lords, <b>to</b> <b>wit</b> Thomas duke of Gloucester; Henry earl of Derby; Richard earl of Arundel and Surrey; Thomas earl of Warwick; and Thomas earl marshal; if any man will do aught against their bodies, and shall maintain them to the death against every man without exception, saving always their allegiance to the king, the prerogative of the crown, the laws and good customs of the realm.|$|E
25|$|David Hume {{acknowledged}} {{that there are}} events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that ‘all events have a specific course or reason.’ Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally {{be divided into two}} kinds, <b>to</b> <b>wit,</b> Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”. Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”. Hume later goes onto say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume’s separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas {{is often referred to as}} “Hume’s Fork”.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} ago good news from {{the king and queen}} reached our Apostolic See {{relating}} that, at great cost and following difficult negotiations, they had obtained a concession from the Sultan of Babylon (that is, Cairo), who to the intense shame of Christians occupies the Holy Sepulchre of the Lord and the other Holy Places beyond the sea that were sanctified by the blood of this same Redeemer, <b>to</b> <b>wit</b> that friars of your Order may reside continuously in the church known as the Sepulchre and celebrate there Solemn Sung Masses and the Divine Office in the manner of the several friars of this Order who are already present in this place; moreover, this same Sultan has also conceded to the King and Queen the Cenacle of the Lord, the chapel where the Holy Spirit was manifested to the Apostles and the other chapel in which Christ appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection, in the presence of Blessed Thomas; and also the news of how the Queen built a convent on Mount Zion where, as is known, the Cenacle and the said chapels are located; where for some time she has had the intention of supporting twelve friars of your Order to assure the divine Liturgy in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, along with three laymen charged with serving the friars and seeing to their needs.|$|E
