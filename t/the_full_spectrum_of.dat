Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

40|$|Multiphoton quantum {{interference}} underpins fundamental {{tests of}} quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. Consequently, the detrimental effect of photon distinguishability in multiphoton interference experiments can be catastrophic. Here, we theoretically prove that accessing the spectral properties of an arbitrary number of photons initially distinguishable in their quantum states allows the scalable restoration of quantum interference in arbitrary linear optical networks, {{without the need for}} additional filtering or post selection. Even more interestingly, we show how harnessing <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>spectra</b> <b>of</b> multiphoton quantum information by spectrally resolved correlation measurements enables the characterization of multiphoton networks and states, produces a wide variety of multipartite entanglement, and increases the possibilities to achieve quantum computational supremacy. Furthermore, the multiphoton interference techniques described here pave the way to a scaling-up of multiphoton interference experiments. These results are therefore of profound interest for future applications of universal spectrally resolved linear optics across fundamental science and quantum technologies with photons with experimentally different spectral properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> {{efficiency}} <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> two industrial {{solar cell}} producers have been analysed. The {{aim was to}} account quantitatively for the different efficiency classes by appropriate extension of a one dimensional model, which is once developed for the special cell process. Lateral inhomogeneities influencing the cell efficiency significantly were determined and taken into account as far as possible. In the first step for each cell process a one dimensional model was developed which describes a representative good cell of this process. In the next step cells from <b>the</b> <b>full</b> efficiency <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> each cell producer were analysed in detail and it was attempted to integrate their properties into the model. One result {{is that in the}} majority of cases low performance is caused by more than one cell parameter. Furthermore these parameters often are laterally inhomogeneous, integration was still mostly possible by suitable averaging procedures. Which parameters are laterally inhomogeneous was found to depend on the starting material {{as well as on the}} specific production process...|$|R
