Glutathione seems {{to play an important}} role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity. Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in response to the need for tropical marine species to be used in routine ecotoxicology and <b>toxicological</b> risk <b>assessment.</b> One group of organisms that is not currently represented in routine ecotoxicology is the ecologically- and economically-critical phylum, Cnidaria. The sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella is a zooxanthellate cnidarian found throughout tropical and sub-tropical oceans, and has frequently been used as a model organism in laboratory studies. However, this is the first study to investigate the sensitivity of A. pulchella and the associated zooxanthellae to a range of contaminants, determining the sensitivity of this species in ecotoxicological investigations. Repeated 96 -h lethal toxicity tests using cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel and zinc demonstrated good result repeatability and a high sensitivity of Aiptasia pulchella compared to many other tested marine species. â€˜Severeâ€™ tentacle retraction was identified as a common and rapid sub-lethal toxicological response and was further refined. Asexual reproduction by â€˜pedal lacerationâ€™ was also observed and appeared to be inhibited by metal exposures. Subsequently, successful asexual reproduction was investigated as a potential chronic sub-lethal endpoint in 28 -d static-renewal tests using cadmium, copper, cobalt, nickel and zinc. These tests showed that adult A. pulchella were able to asexually reproduce at metal concentrations where the offspring either did not survive, or where normal tentacle development was affected. Hence, â€˜development to a juvenile stageâ€™ was assessed as an additional sub- lethal endpoint in 14 -d tests using the same metals as 28 -d reproduction tests. Finally, zooxanthellate A. pulchella use in ecotoxicological testing allows investigations of contaminant effects not only on the animal host, but also on the associated zooxanthellae. This is important for <b>toxicological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> of contaminants such as herbicides that primarily affect photosynthetic organisms, including coral symbionts. The suitability of pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll a fluorometry for <b>toxicological</b> <b>assessments</b> of in-hospite zooxanthellae of A. pulchella was assessed in 48 -h tests using the herbicides diuron and atrazine. Overall, results show that Aiptasia pulchella and the associated zooxanthellae are sensitive to a range of contaminants relative to other tested marine organisms. Mortality and quantifiable sub-lethal effects occurred at relevant trace metal and herbicide concentrations {{in the context of the}} available marine toxicity data. Refinement and standardisation of the culturing and toxicity test methods for A. pulchella described throughout this thesis would make a valuable and much-needed contribution towards improving <b>toxicological</b> risk <b>assessments</b> and water quality guidelines for tropical marine ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The goal of <b>toxicological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> {{of human}} space flight is to {{identify}} and quantify significant risks to astronaut health from air pollution inside the vehicle or habitat, {{and to develop a}} strategy for control of those risks. The approach to completing a <b>toxicological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> involves data and experience on the frequency and severity of toxicological incidents that have occurred during space flight. Control of these incidents depends on being able to understand their cause from in-flight and ground-based analysis of air samples, crew reports of air quality, and known failures in containment of toxic chemicals. <b>Toxicological</b> risk <b>assessment</b> in exploration missions must be based on an evaluation of the unique toxic hazards presented by the habitat location. For example, lunar and Martian dust must be toxicologically evaluated to determine the appropriate control measures for exploration missions. Experience with near-earth flights has shown that the toxic products from fires present the highest risk to crew health from air pollution. Systems and payload leaks also present a significant hazard. The health risk from toxicity associated with materials offgassing or accumulation of human metabolites is generally well controlled. Early tests of lunar and Martian dust simulants have shown that each posses the potential to cause fibrosis in the lung in a murine model.
