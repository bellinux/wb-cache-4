According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts <b>to</b> <b>exchange</b> the notes after the arrests, but Bogdanov tried (and failed) <b>to</b> <b>exchange</b> some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed <b>to</b> <b>exchange</b> several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery were easy <b>to</b> <b>exchange,</b> but the serial {{numbers of the}} 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>exchange</b> in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided <b>to</b> <b>exchange</b> the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E

This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
