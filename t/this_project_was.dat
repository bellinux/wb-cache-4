5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly and the range was gradually phased out.

In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting.

5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

5|$|At an {{appearance}} at the Armadillo World Headquarters, a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because {{of the success of}} the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> not completed either.

5|$|By 1927, a few roadways {{that are}} now part of M-64 were built and open to traffic. The road south of Marenisco was a county road at the time, and the highway between Silver City and Ontonagon {{was a part of the}} western segment of M-35. By the {{beginning}} of 1930, a highway called M-129 was designated south of US2 to the Wisconsin state line and north along Lake Gogebic. By the end of the year, this road was renumbered as the southern section of M-64; the northern section of M-64 was the highway previously designated as the westernmost segment of M-35. The gap between the two sections was filled in by 1932. Some curves in the roadway south of Marenisco were realigned, smoothing out the routing of the highway in late 1961. As <b>this</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> completed, the last segments of M-64 were fully paved, making the highway one of the last in the state to be fully hard-surfaced.|$|E
