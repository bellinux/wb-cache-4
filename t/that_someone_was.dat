Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> writing a radical article.

In a recent discussion of it which draws on Brentano’s, Ross’s and Chisholm’s related views, Noah Lemos concludes that “we may say that the property of being pleased <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> suffering is not an intrinsically good-making property (…) [but] it hardly follows that the property of being pleased is not (…).

5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
500|$|In 1838 Morton was {{the lone}} {{dissenter}} in Commonwealth v. Kneeland, the last time in the nation <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> convicted of blasphemy. [...] Abner Kneeland, a vitriolic former Universalist minister turned pantheist, had made statements Christians found offensive. [...] Convicted by the trial court, Kneeland had appealed, and two more highly politicized trials ended in hung juries before the conviction was upheld in appeals. [...] The full SJC took up the case in March 1836. [...] Kneeland, representing himself, argued that the statements he made did not rise to level specified by the statute, and argued that the statute violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, writing for the court majority, found that Kneeland's speech satisfied the legal definition of blasphemy, and by narrow construction found that the law did not violate the state constitution's protections of free speech and religion. [...] In his dissent Morton argued for a more liberal reading of the Article 2 of the state constitution (which addressed religious freedoms), and argued that every person [...] "has {{a constitutional right to}} discuss the subject of God, to affirm or deny his existence. [...] I cannot agree that a man may be punished for wilfully doing what he has a legal right to do." [...] Governor Edward Everett refused to pardon Kneeland, who served sixty days in prison. The case {{is now one of the}} most frequently cited American cases on blasphemy.|$|E

According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him.

She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did."

[...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings.

[...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. [...] She died in Nice, France, in 1970 at the age of 96. Barney and Brooks are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris.|$|E
