5|$|NC State went {{three and}} out after {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> after Tech incurred a {{running into the}} kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27-yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10-yard rush. NC State recovered <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40-yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12-yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense {{to return to the}} field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27-yard line.|$|E

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|After Tech's kickoff, Air Force went {{three and}} out {{and was forced to}} punt. The Hokies took over at their 34-yard line after the kick. Bryan Randall {{completed}} two quick passes to wide receiver Shawn Witten for a total of 26yards before time in the quarter ran out.

5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score more than six goals in a season, this made him more an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> race. These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness <b>and</b> hardness of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> race these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> race are of similar hardness wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> race this can cause sparking.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{ultrasonic}} motor using thrust {{ball bearing}} with dimple structure on the friction surface has been proposed. <b>The</b> bearing <b>balls</b> are rotated by the friction force caused by the ultrasonic vibration of the stator, and transfer torque to the rotor. The dimple structure on the sliding surface can hold <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> position <b>and</b> rotate <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rotor without a retainer. The newly proposed motor can avoid the friction loss between <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> retainer. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> of 2. 4 mm in radius are used and the radii of the curvature of the dimples of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm are used in this research. The radius difference changes the contact condition between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dimple structure. Fundamental motor characteristics are measured and discussed...|$|R

Seven minutes later Brugge extended their lead when Julien Cools scored. The Belgians kept attacking, but the Liverpool defence of Emlyn Hughes and Tommy Smith were able to repel the Belgians until half-time.|$|E
5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley {{managed to find}} him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, {{who was able to}} win <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E
5|$|Hassett came to {{the crease}} to join Morris, with the new ball already due. Still using the old ball, Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a {{delivery}} that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E

The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen.

I aimed to make the batter hit <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E

40|$|As {{a common}} {{practice}} in Mechanical Alloying (MA), the mixture of the work materials to be alloyed is placed in a container together with relevant milling medium. The vial and the charge materials are then moved {{in such a manner}} to create kinetic energy on the charge materials in the vial. Upon the collisions of the charge materials against each other as well as {{against the wall of the}} vial, kinetic energy is converted into impact energy. This impact energy is absorbed by the work materials which are repeatedly flattened, cold welded, fractured and re-welded - important mechanisms in MA. Since MA process utilizes energy generated by impact, it is important to understand the way on how kinetic energy of charged materials is transferred into impact energy. Four events of collision have been identified in <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> milling process: direct collision between balls, collision with sliding between <b>the</b> <b>balls,</b> direct collision between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> inner surface of the vial as well as collision with the sliding between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> inner surface of the vial. However, the most effective impact event is direct collision between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> inner surface of the vial. This paper presents a model of energy conversion and impact energy generation during the collision based on free falling experiment, which is the closest resemblance to the direct collision between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> inner wall of the vial...|$|R
