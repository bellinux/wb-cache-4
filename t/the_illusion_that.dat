5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|Dance formed his ships into a line {{of battle}} and ordered {{three or four of}} them to raise blue ensigns and the others red, giving the {{impression}} of a heavy escort by implying that the ships with blue ensigns were warships. This ruse provoked a cautious response from Linois, who ordered his squadron to shadow the convoy without closing with them. During the night, Dance held position and Linois remained at a distance, unsure of the strength of the British convoy. At 09:00, Dance reformed his force into sailing formation to put distance between the two forces and Linois took the opportunity to attack, threatening to cut off the rearmost British ships. Dance tacked and his lead vessels came to the support of the rear, engaging Marengo at long range. Unnerved by the sudden British manoeuvere, Linois turned and retreated, convinced that the convoy was defended by an overwhelming force. Continuing <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> he was supported by warships, Dance ordered his ships to pursue Linois over the next two hours, eventually reforming and reaching the Straits of Malacca safely. There they were met several days later by two ships of the line sent from India.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, nearly all discussions (and explanations) of those classic size illusions found in textbooks, the popular media, {{and on the}} {{internet}} use, instead, an older hypothesis that the visual angle is not perceivable (Gregory, 2008, Kaufman & Kaufman, 2002). They can describe and explain only a linear size illusion, which is why they do not properly describe or explain <b>the</b> <b>illusions</b> <b>that</b> most people experience.|$|R
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed {{that many of the}} Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006. Whitney sets up Vincent and Valerie as a couple without knowing they are in fact the same person.|$|E

A ritual that appears to a common yak herder as a straightforward exorcism of disease demons could be interpreted by a senior monk as a representation of conflicting tendencies {{in the mind of}} a meditating ascetic.|$|R

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the invasion, the Allies {{conducted}} Operation Bodyguard, the overall strategy designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio-traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, and Fortitude South, a major deception designed to fool the Germans into believing that the landings would take place at Pas de Calais in July. A fictitious First U.S. Army Group was invented, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton. The Allies constructed dummy tanks, trucks, and landing craft, and positioned them near the coast. Several military units, including II Canadian Corps and 2nd Canadian Division, moved into the area to bolster <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> a large force was gathering there. As well as the broadcast of fake radio-traffic, genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there. Patton remained stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais. Military and civilian personnel alike were aware of the need for secrecy, and the invasion troops were as much as possible kept isolated, especially in the period immediately before the invasion. One American general was sent back to the United States in disgrace after revealing the invasion date at a party.|$|E

25|$|For {{the film}} within a film, Angels with Filthy Souls, {{shooting}} took only one day. To create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> {{the film was}} a 1940s gangster film, the scene was filmed with black-and-white negative film and Johnny's office used authentic items from that era.|$|E

25|$|The effects expert Eugen Schüfftan created {{pioneering}} {{visual effects}} for Metropolis. Among the effects used are miniatures of the city, a camera on a swing, and most notably, the Schüfftan process, in which mirrors {{are used to}} create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>that</b> actors are occupying miniature sets. This new technique was seen again just two years later in Alfred Hitchcock's film Blackmail (1929).|$|E
