25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises {{as a consequence}} of the fact that light behaves as a two-dimensional <b>transverse</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|The wave theory {{predicted}} that light waves could interfere {{with each other}} like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed {{by means of a}} diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light, and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light {{can be explained by the}} wave theory if light were a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what he found. He later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{nonlinear}} modulation of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> propagating in a cubically nonlinear dispersive elastic medium is studied using a multiscale expansion of wave solutions. It is {{found that the}} propagation of quasimonochromatic <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> is described {{by a pair of}} coupled nonlinear Schrodinger (CNLS) equations. In the process of deriving the amplitude equations, it is observed that for a specific choice of material constants and wavenumber, the coefficient of nonlinear terms becomes zero, and the CNLS equations are no longer valid for describing the behaviour of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves.</b> In order to balance the nonlinear effects with the dispersive effects, by intensifying the nonlinearity, a new perturbation expansion is used near the critical wavenumber. It is found that the long time behaviour of the <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> about the critical wavenumber is given by a pair of coupled quintic nonlinear Schrodinger (CQNLS) equations. In the absence of one of the <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> the CQNLS equations reduce to the single quintic nonlinear Schrodinger (QNLS) equation which has already been obtained in the context of water waves.

25|$|Regarding the {{relative}} motion and the mutual influence {{of matter and}} aether, there were two controversial theories. One was developed by Fresnel (and subsequently Lorentz). This model (Stationary Aether Theory) supposed that light propagates as a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> and aether is partially dragged with a certain coefficient by matter. Based on this assumption, Fresnel was able to explain the aberration of light and many optical phenomena.The other hypothesis was proposed by George Gabriel Stokes, who stated in 1845 that the aether was fully dragged by matter (later this view was also shared by Hertz). In this model the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid for fast objects and fluid for slower objects. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, {{but it would be}} rigid enough to transport light. Fresnel's theory was preferred because his dragging coefficient was confirmed by the Fizeau experiment in 1851, who measured the speed of light in moving liquids.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the work}} of Thomas Young (1804) and Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1816), it was {{believed}} that light propagates as a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> within an elastic medium called luminiferous aether. However, a distinction was made between optical and electrodynamical phenomena so it was necessary to create specific aether models for all phenomena. Attempts to unify those models or to create a complete mechanical description of them did not succeed, but after considerable work by many scientists, including Michael Faraday and Lord Kelvin, James Clerk Maxwell (1864) developed an accurate theory of electromagnetism by deriving a set of equations in electricity, magnetism and inductance, named Maxwell's equations. He first proposed that light was in fact undulations (electromagnetic radiation) in the same aetherial medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. However, Maxwell's theory was unsatisfactory regarding the optics of moving bodies, and while he was able to present a complete mathematical model, {{he was not able to}} provide a coherent mechanical description of the aether.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{a century}} later, Young and Fresnel revived the wave theory of light when {{they pointed out}} that light could be a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> rather than a {{longitudinal}} wave – the polarization of a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> (like Newton's [...] "sides" [...] of light) could explain birefringence, and {{in the wake of}} a series of experiments on diffraction the particle model of Newton was finally abandoned. Physicists assumed, moreover, that like mechanical waves, light waves required a medium for propagation, and thus required Huygens's idea of an aether [...] "gas" [...] permeating all space.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{microwave}} {{region of the}} electromagnetic spectrum, a waveguide normally consists of a hollow metallic conductor. [...] These waveguides can {{take the form of}} single conductors with or without a dielectric coating, e.g. the Goubau line and helical waveguides. [...] Hollow waveguides must be one-half wavelength or more in diameter in order to support one or more <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> modes.|$|E
2500|$|Polarization (also polarisation) is a {{property}} applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical {{orientation of the}} oscillations. [...] In a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave,</b> {{the direction of the}} oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction. [...] A simple example of a polarized <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> is vibrations traveling along a taut string (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. [...] In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. [...] Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) in solids. [...] In some types of transverse waves, the wave displacement is limited to a single direction, so these also do not exhibit polarization; for example, in surface waves in liquids (gravity waves), the wave displacement of the particles is always in a vertical plane.|$|E
40|$|Representative {{travel times}} for 50 shocks in {{southern}} California indicate that <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> appear {{to leave the}} focus about half a second earlier, on the average, than longitudinal waves. If fault rupture is propagated with a speed {{greater than that of}} <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> the originating of such waves along a moderately extended fault segment will completely explain the observations. An exact theory is given on the simplest assumptions...|$|R
25|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> {{also known}} as shear waves, have the {{additional}} property, polarization, and are not a characteristic of sound waves.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> {{there are many}} wave motions where the oscillation {{is not limited to}} directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.|$|R
2500|$|So {{knowing the}} {{propagation}} direction (+z in this case) and η, one can {{just as well}} specify the wave in terms of just ex and ey describing the electric field. The vector containing ex and ey (but without the z component which is necessarily zero for a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave)</b> {{is known as a}} Jones vector. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the intensity of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a gas or liquid, sound {{consists}} of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A longitudinal wave {{is associated with}} compression and decompression {{in the direction of}} travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the <b>transverse</b> <b>wave,</b> also called a shear wave, occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the [...] "polarization" [...] of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of orthogonal polarizations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions. Transverse waves can be polarized, for instance. When polarization {{is used as}} a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of linear polarization. A <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as [...] "horizontal" [...] for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. Electromagnetic waves propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a polarizing filter.|$|E
25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} through gases, plasma, and liquids as longitudinal waves, also called compression waves. It requires a medium to propagate. Through solids, however, {{it can be}} transmitted as both longitudinal <b>waves</b> and <b>transverse</b> <b>waves.</b> Longitudinal sound waves are waves of alternating pressure deviations from the equilibrium pressure, causing local regions of compression and rarefaction, while <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> (in solids) are waves of alternating shear stress at right angle to the direction of propagation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>transverse</b> <b>waves,</b> {{there are many}} wave motions where the oscillation {{is not limited to}} directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.|$|R

2500|$|However, a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> {{apparently}} {{required the}} propagating medium {{to behave as}} a solid, {{as opposed to a}} gas or fluid. The idea of a solid that did not interact with other matter seemed a bit odd, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy suggested that perhaps {{there was some sort of}} [...] "dragging", or [...] "entrainment", but this made the aberration measurements difficult to understand. He also suggested that the absence of longitudinal waves suggested that the aether had negative compressibility. George Green pointed out that such a fluid would be unstable. George Gabriel Stokes became a champion of the entrainment interpretation, developing a model in which the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid at very high frequencies and fluid at lower speeds. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to support light.|$|E
2500|$|Before Newton, Christiaan Huygens had {{hypothesized}} that light was a wave propagating through an aether. Newton rejected this idea, {{mainly on the}} ground that both men apparently could only envision light as a longitudinal wave, like sound and other mechanical waves in fluids. However, longitudinal waves necessarily have only one form for a given propagation direction, rather than two polarizations like <b>transverse</b> <b>wave.</b> Thus, longitudinal waves could not explain birefringence, in which two polarizations of light are refracted differently by a crystal. [...] Instead, Newton preferred to imagine non-spherical particles, or [...] "corpuscles", of light with different [...] "sides" [...] that give rise to birefringence. [...] In addition, Newton rejected light as waves in a medium because such a medium would have to extend everywhere in space, and would thereby [...] "disturb and retard the Motions of those great Bodies" [...] (the planets and comets) and thus [...] "as it [...] is of no use, and hinders the Operation of Nature, and makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected".|$|E
2500|$|Sound can {{propagate}} {{through a}} medium such as air, water and solids as longitudinal waves {{and also as}} a <b>transverse</b> <b>wave</b> in solids (see Longitudinal and transverse waves, below). The sound waves are generated by a sound source, such as the vibrating diaphragm of a stereo speaker. The sound source creates vibrations in the surrounding medium. As the source continues to vibrate the medium, the vibrations propagate away from the source {{at the speed of}} sound, thus forming the sound wave. At a fixed distance from the source, the pressure, velocity, and displacement of the medium vary in time. At an instant in time, the pressure, velocity, and displacement vary in space. Note that the particles of the medium do not travel with the sound wave. This is intuitively obvious for a solid, and {{the same is true for}} liquids and gases (that is, the vibrations of particles in the gas or liquid transport the vibrations, while the average position of the particles over time does not change). [...] During propagation, waves can be reflected, refracted, or attenuated by the medium.|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} the {{direction}} of the oscillation relative to the propagation direction, we can distinguish between longitudinal <b>wave</b> and <b>transverse</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>waves</b> {{cause the}} medium to vibrate at {{a right angle}} to the {{direction}} of the wave or energy being carried by the medium. <b>Transverse</b> <b>waves</b> have two parts - the crest and the trough. The crest is the highest point of the wave and the trough is the lowest. The distance between a crest and a trough is half of wavelength. The wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough.|$|R
40|$|Observing the {{excitation}} {{mechanisms of}} incompressible <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> {{is vital for}} determining how energy propagates through the lower solar atmosphere. We aim to show the connection between convectively driven photospheric flows and incompressible chromospheric waves. The observations presented here show the propagation of incompressible motion through the quiet lower solar atmosphere, from the photosphere to the chromosphere. We determine photospheric flow vectors to search for signatures of vortex motion and compare results to {photospheric flows present in} convective simulations. Further, we search for the chromospheric response to vortex motions. Evidence is presented that suggests incompressible waves can be excited by the vortex motions of a strong magnetic flux concentration in the photosphere. A chromospheric counterpart to the photospheric vortex motion is also observed, presenting itself as a quasi-periodic torsional motion. Fine-scale, fibril structures that emanate from the chromospheric counterpart support <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> that are driven by the observed torsional motion. A new technique for obtaining details of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> from time-distance diagrams is presented and the properties of <b>transverse</b> <b>waves</b> (e. g., amplitudes and periods) excited by the chromospheric torsional motion are measured.
