5|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited {{directly from}} the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. It allowed {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers {{than at any other time}} before or since.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} closer to <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. He quotes local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini {{was taken to a}} command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
25|$|Later {{on in the}} 1930s, Curry began wrestling in Detroit under {{promoter}} Adam Weissmuller (uncle of Johnny Weissmuller) {{who also}} trained him for his professional career. Curry stayed in Detroit for several years developing his brutal, hardcore style of wrestling {{that made him a}} top name in the territory. Curry was so well known that he even faced legendary heavyweight pro boxer Jack Dempsey in an exhibition match in 1940. Years later Curry would often claim that he knocked Dempsey out in the match but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Curry was stopped in the second round.|$|E

5000|$|Lydia {{thought they}} were Kōichi's {{biological}} children. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> Kōichi's nieces, the daughters of his deceased sister. He adopted them after they were orphaned.|$|R
50|$|A medical {{examiner}} {{had failed to}} check Spence's statement that his recent hospitalisation was due to influenza. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Spence had <b>been</b> suffering a serious diabetic condition.|$|R
25|$|His old {{opinions}} about parliamentary reform seem still {{to cling to}} him—the only decided observation he ever made when the Bill was first explained {{to him and he}} said, ‘Well this is a new constitution’ and though he is of course very anxious for the success of your administration I am not at all clear that he is equally anxious for the measure upon which that success depends. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he never yielded at all upon the question till my own opinions had become very strong and perfectly unchangeable, and, even then, it was with the greatest difficulty that he could be reconciled to my supporting the question.|$|E
25|$|Other sources {{claim that}} an angry mob {{tried to kill}} Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. Heracleides of Pontus asserts that the {{audience}} tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. I {{can still}} hear {{the way he was}} whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E
60|$|Alma {{accepted}} {{the situation with}} an apathy <b>that</b> amazed Anna. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Alma <b>was</b> stunned by a thought {{that had come to}} her even while Anna was speaking.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Hereward's heart <b>was</b> gnawed {{with shame}} and remorse; and {{therefore}} he fancied, and not without reason, {{that all men}} pointed at him the finger of scorn.|$|R
25|$|Until {{the passing}} of the Married Women's Property Act in 1870 a wife had no {{independent}} existence under English law, and therefore no right to own property or to enter into contracts separately from her husband, or to sue for divorce, or for the control and custody of her children. Helen is misled by ideas of romantic love and duty into the delusion that she can repair her husband's conduct. Hattersley declares that he wants a pliant wife who will not interfere with his fun, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he really wants quite the opposite. Milicent cannot resist her mother's pressure, so she marries Ralph against her will. Wealthy Annabella wants only a title, while Lord Lowborough truly and devotedly loves her. The social climber Jane Wilson seeks wealth.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> {{morning of}} this eventful day, Mr. Alexander Fairford had {{received}} from his correspondent and friend, Provost Crosbie of Dumfries, a letter of the following tenor: ...|$|R
60|$|Abruptly Kurt {{left them}} and hurried {{out of the}} house. How strange that {{difficult}} feelings had arisen--emotions he had never considered at all! But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> leaving his home forever. All <b>was</b> explained in <b>that.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sir Agravaine <b>the</b> Dolorous {{was out of}} {{his element}} at King Arthur's court, and he knew it. It <b>was</b> this {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> had given him that settled air of melancholy from which he derived his title.|$|R
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b> let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in {{this book}} a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an {{understanding}} of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib [...] "originality." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> with <b>the</b> {{progress}} of the hours and days, the conviction had been borne in upon Viviette more and more forcibly that not for kingdoms and principalities could she afford to risk the discovery of her presence here by any living soul.|$|R
60|$|And now {{it must be}} told why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Sir Palamydes came to be in such a sorry case as that; for <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{locked and}} shut outside of the tower, whilst the Lady Belle Isoult was shut and locked inside thereof.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> Rollo’s father <b>was</b> {{accustomed}} to come every spring, and purchase his garden seeds at this farm; and so, {{after a few}} minutes, {{they went into the}} house, taking Rollo with them, to get the seeds <b>that</b> <b>were</b> wanted, out of the seed-room.|$|R
500|$|Further, the CBO {{reported}} in January 2017 that it expected {{enrollment in the}} exchanges to rise from 10 million during 2017 to 13 million by 2027, assuming laws {{in place at the}} end of the Obama administration were continued. Following a 2015 CBO report that reached a similar conclusion, Paul Krugman wrote: [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this report is much, much closer to what supporters of reform have said than it is to the scare stories of the critics--no death spirals, no job-killing, major gains in coverage at relatively low cost." ...|$|E
500|$|Neyer {{noted that}} [...] "Landis has {{been blamed for}} delaying the {{integration}} of the major leagues, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the owners didn't want black players in the majors any more than Landis did.

500|$|By 1958, Hand was {{suffering}} from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking. [...] "I can just manage, with not infrequent pauses, to walk {{about a third of}} a mile," [...] he wrote to Felix Frankfurter. [...] "My feet get very numb and my back painful. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> 86 is too long." [...] Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower's [...] "Commission on National Goals", but he resigned because [...] "it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do".|$|E
6000|$|The {{chaplain}} laughed. [...] "You, sir," [...] he said, [...] "are close enough!" [...] And <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>the</b> {{last few}} days, {{no amount of}} wine would unseal Mr. Warrington's lips, when the artless Sampson by chance touched {{on the subject of}} his patron's loss.|$|R
60|$|I {{set out to}} see the lumber-camp, and {{although}} I stepped forth boldly, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> with all my love for the Wild West I {{would have liked to}} be at home. But here I was, and I determined not to show the white feather.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his study}} of war correspondents, The First Casualty, Phillip Knightley wrote that [...] "in Korea, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Burchett and Winnington were a better source of news than the UN {{information}} officers, and if the allied reporters did not see them they risked being beaten on stories".|$|R
500|$|The Rules of the Game premiered on Friday, July 7, 1939, at the Colisée Theatre in Paris to a {{full house}} and later at the Aubert Palace also in Paris. It was shown on a double billing with a {{patriotic}} documentary about French history. The audience at the screening consisted {{of members of the}} right-wing organisations, who booed after a while into the screening; Paulette Dubost said people at the screening fought and one person tried to set fire to the theatre. Renoir said he [...] "depicted pleasant, sympathetic characters, but showed them in a society in the process of disintegration, so that they were defeated at the onset... the audience recognized this. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide do not care to do it in front of witnesses." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2002 {{conference for}} Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, Dr. Nancy Tuana {{asserted}} that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction; she states {{that it has been}} ignored because of [...] "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear." [...] She reasoned that this fear causes ignorance, which veils female sexuality. O'Connell states, [...] "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both are sexual and both are reproductive." [...] She reiterates that the vestibular bulbs appear {{to be part of the}} clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.|$|E
500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{second time}} Gwendolen {{proposed}} to invite her mother with Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, Grandcourt had at first been silent, and then drawled, [...] "We can't be having those people always. Gascoigne talks too much. Country clergy are always bores--with their confounded fuss about everything." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{she argued}} to herself, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{she did not}} wish to go.
