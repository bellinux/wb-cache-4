5000|$|The anti-Pauline {{context of}} the Pseudo-Clementines is recognised, but the {{association}} with Simon Magus is surprising since they have little in common. However the majority of scholars accept Baur's identification, though others, including Lightfoot, argued extensively that the [...] "Simon Magus" [...] of the Pseudo-Clementines {{was not meant to}} stand for Paul. Recently, Berlin pastor Hermann Detering (1995) has made the case that the veiled anti-Pauline stance of the Pseudo-Clementines has historical roots, that the Acts 8 encounter between Simon the magician and Peter is itself based on the conflict between Peter and Paul. Detering's belief has not found general support among scholars, but Robert M.

40|$|It is {{an irony}} {{of history that}} by late antiquity Paul had become the {{authority}} figure he never was during his lifetime. However, by the subapostolic and patristic periods Paul's apostolic authority was no longer considered quite so controversial.

It is therefore {{no surprise that the}} premier apocalyptic theologian of the New Testament would spawn several apocalyptic imitators.

40|$|The {{debate between}} AB du Toit and EP Sanders on Paul and Palestinian Judaism: The road ahead The {{aim of the}} article is to analyse the {{underlying}} structure of the critical reaction of AB du Toit against EP Sanders’s Pauline interpretation. It is shown that Du Toit’s criticism of Sanders rests on his identification of Paul’s opponents and their theology in Romans 4. This is questioned because of the dubious grounds on which his argument rests: the antithesis which is interpreted as polemical {{and the use of}} mirror reading. Secondly the underlying structures of their arguments are analysed. From this it becomes clear that there are hermeneutical and methodological differences between them which prevents Du Toit to do justice to Sanders’s interpretation. Lastly it is suggested that a movement away from a strictly ‘theological approach ’ to one which also takes the social context seriously, may be of much help in understanding what <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Paul</b> was saying...|$|E
40|$|David Sim {{has argued}} that Matthew’s {{so-called}} Great Commission (Mt 28 : 16 – 20) represents a direct anti-Pauline polemic. While this thesis may be theoretically possible and perhaps fi ts within the perspective of an earlier era in New Testament research, namely that of the Tübingen School, the evidence in both Matthew and the Pauline corpus does not support such a reading of early Christianity. In this paper, I argue that an antithetical relationship between Matthew’s Great Commission and Paul’s Gentile mission as reflected in his epistles is possible only (1) with a certain reading of Matthew and (2) with a caricature of Paul. In light {{of the most recent}} research on both Matthew’s Great Commission and <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>Paul,</b> these two traditions can be seen as harmonious and not antithetical in spite of the recent arguments to the contrary. My argument provides a further corrective to the view of early Christianity, which posits a deep schism between so-called Jewish Christianity and Paul’s ostensibly Law-free mission to the Gentiles.

Although {{the majority of the}} passage is straight-forward and uncontroversial, there are a few matters which have generated much debate. First, there are questions about the tradition of Pauline authorship for the whole of the Pastoral Epistles (PE, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus). Second, in limited circles 1 there is concern over the language of drunkard (πάροινος, v. 3). Finally, and of concern to all, is the ambiguous phrase husband of one wife (μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα) in v. 2.

However, throughout the modern era there has been ongoing debate over the validity of the traditional view. I. Howard Marshall (who theorizes against Pauline authorship) 2 provides this view of the scholarly divide: A significant minority of scholars hold that the PE are the work of Paul, whether directly or indirectly by the use of a secretary/amanuensis.

The two lines of Paul's suffering are his personal suffering - his struggle with the thorn in the flesh; and his suffering through persecution for Christ's sake. It is through his personal suffering that Paul endears himself to his readers. 2 Cor. 12 : 1 - 10 reveals {{the function of the}} thorn - it brings vindication. Paul's personal suffering merges with his suffering for Christ, and the note of joy, hope, glory and vindication is emphasized. Just as Paul shares in Christ's suffering, he will share in the victory and glory too. Paul sees his suffering in the light of Christ's suffering and the suffering of his readers in the light of his suffering. Religious Studies and ArabicM. A. (Religious Studies...|$|R

40|$|Was Paul {{the second}} founder of Christianity, {{striking}} off in directions Jesus never envisaged and teaching lessons Christ never endorsed? In this study Paul Barnett {{sets out to}} establish that, current theories aside, the apostle was a true missionary of Jesus, authentically extending the Lords mission. Barnett argues that Pauls own writings are supplemented by Lukes contemporaneously written narrative of the Acts of the Apostles. He follows Paul on a decade of travels, examining the apostle in a historic context as well as revealed by Pauls own writings. Along the way, Barnett addresses a number of questions, such as Why did Paul persecute Christians when his teacher, Gamaliel, was against it? Was Paul converted or called? Are the new perspectives on Paul true to the evidence? and Why was Romans so important as a statement of Pauls gospel?
