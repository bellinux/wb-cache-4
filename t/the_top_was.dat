5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever {{he is in a}} dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{works on}} the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died {{unexpectedly}} in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit {{at the center of}} the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support car had broken down.|$|E

With {{the exception of}} one storm producing a tornadic event, <b>the</b> overshooting <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> nearly steady-state. <b>The</b> <b>tops</b> <b>were</b> consistently high and wide, reaching maximum heights within about 5 minutes of the initiation of hail.

5|$|The 17th century Yarn Market is {{a market}} cross which was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain. The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> rung to indicate the start of trading.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded down from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men {{had to carry}} each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups {{to protect them from}} North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus {{published}} {{a revision of}} indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis. They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been {{pointed out in the}} 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> attributed to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, it is possible that P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species.|$|E

5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the visor to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, {{in order to}} differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|The stay at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> short-lived. With the October 31, 2005, BCS rankings, Texas {{remained}} {{first in}} the computer rankings, with Virginia Tech pulling even with USC for numbertwo in the computer rankings. However, USC remained atop both human polls {{and was able to}} reclaim the top overall ranking. Texas and USC won the rest of their games and faced each other in the National Championship, which Texas won41–38. This was only the 35thmeeting of the twotop-ranked teams in the history of college football, including both regular season and bowl games. The BCS system now ensures that the twotop teams in the BCS rankings face each other annually in a national championship game, but the methodology for ranking the teams remains controversial among fans and sportswriters.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 84,000 album-equivalent {{units in the}} week ending March 24, {{according}} to Nielsen Music. In addition, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was also the best-selling album of the week, ranking number 1 on Billboards Top Album Sales chart, with pure album sales of 76,000 copies (90% of overall units). It became Stefani's first number 1 and third top five album as a solo artist. The only time she previously reached <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>was</b> with her band No Doubt with their third record Tragic Kingdom (1995). With this feat, she became the fifth woman to first reach number 1 {{as part of a}} band or group, and then later earn their own solo leader. However, it also marked the lowest first week sales for one of her albums, with Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape selling 309,000 copies and 243,000 copies in their first weeks, respectively. With the release Stefani peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, up approximately 557% from her previous peak of 53, the chart's fourth-highest jump ever. The following week, Billboard reported that the album dropped 16 places on the Billboard 200, with sales decreasing 78% to 17,700 copies. For the next five weeks, the album continued to drop down the charts. In its seventh week, it jumped from number 82 to number 59, the same week she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The record was on the chart for 13 weeks; its final position for the week ending August 6, 2016, was number 114. On May 27, 2016, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was made available on vinyl exclusively at Barnes & Noble in the United States; after its release, it debuted and peaked at number 23 on the Vinyl Albums component chart.|$|E
