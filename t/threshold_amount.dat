5|$|Combat is an {{important}} part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.|$|E

25|$|The major {{component}} of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where two individuals share in common a number of consecutive SNPs, it can be projected that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> set by the testing company, then these two individuals {{are considered to be}} a match. The unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. Most companies will show the customers how many cMs they share, and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, {{the relationship between the two}} individuals can be estimated, however due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbate {{concentrations}} {{over the}} renal re-absorption threshold pass freely into the urine and are excreted. At high dietary doses (corresponding {{to several hundred}} mg/day in humans) ascorbate is accumulated in the body until the plasma levels reach the renal resorption threshold, which is about 1.5nbsp&mg/dL in men and 1.3nbsp&mg/dL in women. Concentrations in the plasma larger than this value (thought to represent body saturation) are rapidly excreted in the urine with a half-life of about 30 minutes. Concentrations less than this <b>threshold</b> <b>amount</b> are actively retained by the kidneys, and the excretion half-life {{for the remainder of}} the vitamin C store in the body thus increases greatly, with the half-life lengthening as the body stores are depleted. This half-life rises until it is as long as 83 days by the onset of the first symptoms of scurvy.|$|E

In addition, hypericin is under research as an agent in photodynamic therapy, whereby a biochemical is absorbed by an organism to be later activated with spectrum-specific light from specialized lamps or laser sources, for therapeutic purposes. The antibacterial and antiviral effects of hypericin are also believed to arise from its ability for photo-oxidation of cells and viral particles.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, one {{meteorological}} {{case study}} for two Iranian airports are presented. Attempts {{have been made}} to study the predefined <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> of some instability indices such as vertical velocity and relative humidity. Two important output variables from a numerical weather prediction model have been used to survey thunderstorms. The climatological state of thunder days in Iran has been determined to aid in choosing the airports for the case studies. The synoptic pattern, atmospheric thermodynamics and output from a numerical weather prediction model have been studied to evaluate the occurrence of storms and to verify the threshold instability indices that are based on Gordon and Albert (2000) and Miller (1972). Using data from the Statistics and Data Center of the Iran Meteorological Organization, 195 synoptic stations were used to study the climatological pattern of thunderstorm days in Iran during a 15 -yr period (1991 â€“ 2005). Synoptic weather maps and thermodynamic diagrams have been drawn using data from synoptic stations and radiosonde data. A 15 -km resolution version of the WRF numerical model has been implemented for the Middle East region with the assistance of global data from University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The Tabriz airport weather station has been selected for further study due to its high frequency of thunderstorms (more than 35 thunderstorm days per year) and the existence of an upper air station. Despite the fact that storms occur less often at the Tehran weather station, the station has been chosen as the second case study site due to its large amount of air traffic. Using these two case studies (Tehran at 00 : 00 UTC, 31 April 2009 and Tabriz at 12 : 00 UTC, 31 April 2009), the results of this research show that the <b>threshold</b> <b>amounts</b> of 30 Â°C for KI, âˆ’ 2 Â°C for LI and âˆ’ 3 Â°C for SI suggests the occurrence and non-occurrence of thunderstorms at the Tehran and Tabriz stations, respectively. The WRF model output of vertical velocity and relative humidity are the two most important indices for examining storm occurrence, and they have a numerical threshold of 1 m sâˆ’ 1 and 80 %, respectively. These results are comparable to other studies that have examined thunderstorm occurrence...|$|R
