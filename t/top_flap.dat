Two hand grenades of any type in the US arsenal could be attached on either side of each pouch, with the spoon hooked through a web strap and another web strap with snap-closure wrapped around the top. Like other pouches in the system, the ammunition pouches each attached to the web belt with a pair of slide keepers and, uniquely, an adjustable length strap with a closable hook which connected to the rectangular hook on the suspenders, intended to keep the case upright and transfer some of the weight directly to the shoulders.|$|E
50|$|Packaging of wool has {{not changed}} much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from jute, prior {{to the use of}} {{synthetic}} fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia, In South Africa woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost. Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a 280 mm label sewn onto the <b>top</b> <b>flap</b> of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale of wool packs contains 50 packs that measure 70 x 70 cm x 98 cm and have 46 cm flaps.|$|E

A <b>top</b> <b>flap</b> closed by means of a blackened brass snap and the canvas case could be attached to the webbing by means of a single slide keeper. Later production models incorporated a metal-rimmed drainage eyelet {{at the bottom of the}} pouch. Each soldier was issued one case for carrying a field dressing, and those whose duties required them to carry the standard unmounted lensatic compass carried another for that piece of equipment. Placement varied with unit standards, but this case was often mounted in one of three places. Either on the horizontal straps on the suspenders (either shoulder and either right-side up or upside down for quick access), on the pistol belt between the buckle and ammunition case, or on the piece of webbing on the side of the ammunition case intended for the attachment of grenades.|$|E

This design was modified slightly in the 1961-pattern Field Pack (See Modifications below). Common features of both including canvas construction, attachment to the pistol belt with two slide keepers and a pair of eyelets at the top of the pack for attaching the individual suspenders directly to the pack in order to keep it upright and help distribute weight to the shoulders. Both also included a web handle at the top for hand-carriage, web strap along the side with eyelets for the attachment of equipment with either slide keepers or wire hangers, and a pair of web straps at the bottom of the pack for attaching items like the poncho and poncho liner. Both also featured a clear plastic window on the inner side of the pack for inserting a card with name and service number, as well as cloth-taped edges.|$|E
50|$|Field Pack (medium) - The field pack is made {{of water}} {{repellent}} treated nylon duck and webbing, spacer fabric, and metal hardware. It {{can be used with}} or without the LC-1 Field Pack Frame. The main compartment closes by means of a drawstring secured by a plastic cord clamp. A radio pocket is located against the back on the inside. The size of the pack may be decreased for smaller loads by means of three para-cord ties, stitched to the inside bottom of the pack, and three metal D-rings located directly below the internal radio pocket. Three pockets on the outside, with strap and buckle adjustable closures and with snap fasteners for quick access, are provided for miscellaneous items. The <b>top</b> <b>flap</b> has a pocket with a hook and pile fastener tape sealed closure. Equipment hangers are located above each outside pocket and on each side. Drainage eyelets are provided {{in the bottom of the}} main compartment and the outside pockets. An envelope pocket is located at the top, back of the pack and padded with spacer cloth, into which the field pack frame is inserted when the field pack is used on the field pack frame. Buckles and straps at each side near the bottom are used for anchoring the field pack to the field pack frame. Two rectangular wire loops located at the top back of the field pack and D rings on each side at the bottom of the field pack are used to provide shoulder strap attachment when the field pack is carried without the field pack frame. A waterproof bag is supplied for the main compartment and each of the three outside pockets for keeping equipment dry.|$|E
50|$|Its {{ensemble}} {{consisted of}} a nylon pack with a cinch cord, <b>top</b> <b>flap</b> and three exterior pockets and a tubular aluminum frame with padded shoulder straps and waist belt. The Lightweight Rucksack, Nylon, OG106 (FSN 8465-782-3248) was developed in 1962 {{as a part of}} the United States Army's efforts to develop suitable equipment for use by Special Forces, long-range reconnaissance patrols, and mountain and arctic troops. Testing was conducted by the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Alaska and Panama Canal Zone. Four different patterns of the lightweight rucksack exist, with the latter two models featuring attachment points which allow the pack itself to be mounted in two and three different locations on the frame, respectively. A prototype rucksack was produced in 1962, featuring a welded frame. The 1964 model was virtually the same, but with the contract information stamped in the pack rather than sewn in on a label. The next improvement came along in 1965, when the frame was changed to a riveted version rather than a welded one. The last modification was made in 1968, with the addition of a middle horizontal back strap. In South Vietnam the lightweight rucksack replaced and augmented the M1956 and M1961 versions of combat packs and was later partially replaced by the tropical rucksack of the M1967 MLCE (Designed specifically for jungle warfare). The rucksack was typically mounted low on the frame allowing bulky equipment to be strapped above. Stocks of lightweight rucksacks were replaced in United States military service beginning in 1974 with the adoption of the ALICE equipment. Lightweight rucksacks are currently quite desirable among collectors and period reenactors alike, and often retail for anywhere between $250 and $350 USD at dedicated militaria dealers and online auctions.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{problems}} were encountered during early carrier trials. The combination of an aft cockpit and the Corsair's long nose made landings hazardous for newly trained pilots. During landing approaches {{it was found}} that oil from the hydraulic cowl flaps could spatter onto the windscreen, badly reducing visibility, and the undercarriage oleo struts had bad rebound characteristics on landing, allowing the aircraft to bounce out of control down the carrier deck. The first problem was solved by locking the <b>top</b> cowl <b>flap</b> down permanently, then replacing it with a fixed panel. The undercarriage bounce took more time to solve but eventually a [...] "bleed valve" [...] incorporated in the legs allowed the hydraulic pressure to be released gradually as the aircraft landed. The Corsair was not considered fit for carrier use until the wing stall problems and the deck bounce could be solved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wooden box}} does not only feature {{prominently}} {{in the name of}} the theatre, but also inspired the trade mark of the Puppenkiste: the representation of the two <b>top</b> cover <b>flaps</b> of a wooden box. Across the top covers, the name [...] "Augsburger Puppenkiste" [...] is printed, along with the addition [...] "Oehmichens marionette theatre". These box lids have long since become the official trade mark of the Puppenkiste. Every single film or theatre-production starts with a small sequence of the top covers being opened. In the actual theatre, the stage is covered by two enormous box lids (0,90x 2 metres). For the TV productions, special cover flaps were produced: they are smaller and modeled to fit the screen format with the aspect ratio 4:3. These very box tops were used mostly unchanged since the end of the 1950s in almost all TV productions of the Puppenkiste. For the production of [...] "Der Raub der Mitternachtssonne" [...] (The theft of the midnight sun) (1994), a so-called [...] "Insertkasten" [...] (insert box) was designed to fit the screen aspect ratio of 16:9, which is respectively longer than the usual 4:3 format.|$|R

While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|R
50|$|As {{originally}} {{described by}} Dr. Eloessar, the procedure started with cutting a 2 inch wide, U-shaped flap of {{skin on the}} side of the chest wall underneath the axilla and scapula. The section of rib under the <b>top</b> of the <b>flap</b> was also removed. The finger-like skin flap was then inserted into the cavity made in the chest wall and sown into the inner pleural lining of the chest. The edges of the incision are then brought together. The flap allows for 1) passive drainage of the pleural space and 2) negative pressure to develop in the thoracic cavity due to it being easier for air to escape than to enter the chest. The lung can then expand to the chest wall and seal the inner opening of the flap. Other surgeons have subsequently proposed modifications to the procedure.|$|R

It had a [...] side-valve engine with thermocirculation radiator (no pump) {{and the ability to}} be started by a crank handle, should the battery not have sufficient power to turn the starter motor, running from the six-Volt charging system. The windscreen wipers were powered by the vacuum ported from the engine intake manifold — as the car laboured uphill the wipers would slow to a standstill due to the intake manifold vacuum dropping to near nil, only to start working again as the top was reached and the intake vacuum increased. The windscreen opened forward pivoting on hinges on the <b>top</b> edge; two <b>flaps</b> either side of the scuttle also let air into the car. The car has a durable four-cylinder motor.|$|R
40|$|PIV {{measurements}} of the flow {{in the region of}} a flap side edge are presented for several blowing flap configurations. The test model is a NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 Hicks Mod-B main-element airfoil with a half-span Fowler flap. Air is blown from small slots located along the flap side edge on either the top, bottom or side surfaces. The test set up is described and flow measurements for a baseline and three blowing flap configurations are presented. The effects that the flap tip jets have on the structure of the flap side edge flow are discussed for each of the flap configurations tested. The results indicate that blowing air from a slot located along the top surface of the flap greatly weakened the top vortex system and pushed it further off the top surface. Blowing from the bottom flap surface kept the strong side vortex further outboard while blowing from the side surface only strengthened the vortex system or accelerated the merging of the side vortex to the <b>flap</b> <b>top</b> surface. It is concluded that blowing from the top or bottom surfaces of the flap may lead to a reduction of flap side edge noise...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{develop a}} rabbit {{experimental}} study {{to test the}} hypothesis that surgical repair of hypospadias with severe ventral curvatures might be completed in one stage, if a graft, such as buccal mucosa, could be placed over the tunica vaginalis flap used in corporoplasty for ventral lengthening, with the addition of an onlay preputial island flap to complete the urethroplasty. Materials and methods: The experimental procedure with rabbits included a tunica vaginalis flap for reconstruction of the corpora after corporotomy, simulating a ventral lengthening operation. A buccal mucosa graft was placed directly on <b>top</b> of the <b>flap,</b> and the urethroplasty was completed with an onlay preputial island flap. Eight rabbits were divided into 4 groups, sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively, and submitted to histological evaluation. Results: We observed a large number of complications, such as fistula (75 %), urinary retention (50 %) and stenosis (50 %). There were two deaths related to the procedure. Histological evaluation demonstrated a severe and persistent inflammatory reaction. No viable tunica vaginalis or buccal mucosa was identified. Conclusions: In this animal model, the association of a buccal mucosa graft over the tunica vaginalis flap was not successful, and resulted in complete loss of both tissues...|$|R
40|$|We used feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) protease (PR) as a mutational framework to define determinants for the observed substrate and inhibitor specificity distinctions between FIV and human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) PRs. Multiple-substitution mutants were constructed by replacing the residues {{in and around the}} active site of FIV PR with the structurally equivalent residues of HIV- 1 PR. Mutants included combinations of three critical regions (FIV numbering, with equivalent HIV numbering in superscript) : I 3732 V in the active core region; N 5546 M, M 5647 I, and V 5950 I in the flap region; and L 9780 T, I 9881 P, Q 9982 V, P 10083 N, and L 10184 I in the 90 s loop region. Significant alterations in specificity were observed, consistent with the involvement of these residues in determining the substrate-inhibitor specificity distinctions between FIV and HIV PRs. Two previously identified residues, I 35 and I 57 of FIV PR, were intolerant to substitution and yielded inactive PRs. Therefore, we attempted to recover the activity by introducing secondary mutations. The addition of G 6253 F and K 6354 I, located at the <b>top</b> of the <b>flap</b> and outside the active site, compensated for the activity lost in the I 5748 G substitution mutants. An additional two substitutions, D 10588 N and N 8874 T, facilitated recovery of activity in mutants that included the I 3530 D substitution. Determination of Ki values of potent HIV- 1 PR inhibitors against these mutants showed that inhibitor specificity paralleled that of HIV- 1 PR. The findings indicate that maintenance of both substrate and inhibitor specificity is a function of interactions between residues {{both inside and outside the}} active site. Thus, mutations apparently peripheral to the active site can have a dramatic influence on inhibitor efficacy...|$|R
60|$|We {{have another}} market in our French watering-place - {{that is to}} say, a few wooden hutches in the open street, down by the Port - devoted to fish. Our fishing-boats are famous everywhere; and our fishing people, though they love lively colours, and taste is neutral (see Bilkins), {{are among the most}} picturesque people we ever encountered. They have not only a quarter of their own in the town itself, but they occupy whole villages of their own on the {{neighbouring}} cliffs. Their churches and chapels are their own; they consort with one another, they intermarry among themselves, their customs are their own, and their costume is their own and never changes. As soon as one of their boys can walk, he is provided with a long bright red nightcap; and one of their men would as soon think of going afloat without his head, as without that indispensable appendage to it. Then, they wear the noblest boots, with the hugest <b>tops</b> - <b>flapping</b> and bulging over anyhow; above which, they encase themselves in such wonderful overalls and petticoat trousers, made to all appearance of tarry old sails, so additionally stiffened with pitch and salt, that the wearers have a walk of their own, and go straddling and swinging about among the boats and barrels and nets and rigging, a sight to see. Then, their younger women, by dint of going down to the sea barefoot, to fling their baskets into the boats as they come in with the tide, and bespeak the first fruits of the haul with propitiatory promises to love and marry that dear fisherman who shall fill that basket like an Angel, have the finest legs ever carved by Nature in the brightest mahogany, and they walk like Juno. Their eyes, too, are so lustrous that their long gold ear-rings turn dull beside those brilliant neighbours; and when they are dressed, what with these beauties, and their fine fresh faces, and their many petticoats - striped petticoats, red petticoats, blue petticoats, always clean and smart, and never too long - and their home-made stockings, mulberry-coloured, blue, brown, purple, lilac - which the older women, taking care of the Dutch-looking children, sit in all sorts of places knitting, knitting, knitting from morning to night - and what with their little saucy bright blue jackets, knitted too, and fitting close to their handsome figures; and what with the natural grace with which they wear the commonest cap, or fold the commonest handkerchief round their luxuriant hair - we say, in a word and out of breath, that taking all these premises into our consideration, it has never been a matter of the least surprise to us that we have never once met, in the cornfields, on the dusty roads, by the breezy windmills, on the plots of short sweet grass overhanging the sea - anywhere - a young fisherman and fisherwoman of our French watering-place together, but the arm of that fisherman has invariably been, {{as a matter of course}} and without any absurd attempt to disguise so plain a necessity, round the neck or waist of that fisherwoman. And we have had no doubt whatever, standing looking at their uphill streets, house rising above house, and terrace above terrace, and bright garments here and there lying sunning on rough stone parapets, that the pleasant mist on all such objects, caused by their being seen through the brown nets hung across on poles to dry, is, in the eyes of every true young fisherman, a mist of love and beauty, setting off the goddess of his heart.|$|R
60|$|Julia {{was amused}} with his condescension, which she thought augured perfect good-nature and affability. After all, thought Julia, if noble and {{commanding}} qualities {{are necessary to}} excite admiration or to command respect, familiar virtues induce us to love more tenderly, and good temper is absolutely necessary to contribute to our comfort. On the whole, she was rather pleased than otherwise, that Antonio could receive and return what was evidently intended for a witticism, although as yet she did not comprehend it. But Charles did not leave her long in doubt. On {{the north side of}} the Mohawk, and at about fifty miles from its mouth, is a mountain which, as we have already said, juts, in a nearly perpendicular promontory, into the bed of the river; its inclination is sufficient to admit of its receiving the name of a nose. Without the least intention of alluding to our hero, the early settlers had affixed the name of St. Anthony, who appears to have been a kind of Dutch deity in this state, and to have monopolized all the natural noses within her boundaries to himself. The vulgar idiom made the pronunciation an-TONY'S nose--and all this Charles briefly explained to Miss Emmerson and her niece by way of giving point to his own wit. He had hardly made them comprehend the full brilliancy and beauty of his application of the mountain to their driver, when they reached the pass itself. The road was barely sufficient to suffer two carriages to move by each other without touching, being from necessity dug out of the base of the mountain; a precipice of many feet led to the river, which was high and turbulent at the time; there was no railing nor any protection on the side next the water--and in endeavouring to avoid the unprotected side of the road, two wagons had met a short time before, and one of them lost a wheel in the encounter--its owner had gone to a distance for assistance, leaving the vehicle where it had fallen. The horses of Antonio, unaccustomed to such a sight, were with some difficulty driven by the loaded wagon, and when nearly past the object, took a sudden fright at its <b>top,</b> which was <b>flapping</b> in the wind. All the skill and exertions of Antonio to prevent their backing was useless, and carriage and horses would inevitably have gone off the bank together, had not Charles, with admirable presence of mind, opened a door, and springing out, placed a billet of wood, which had been used as a base for a lever in lifting the broken wagon, under one of the wheels. This checked the horses until Antonio had time to rally them, and, by using the whip with energy, bring them into the road again. He certainly showed great dexterity as a coachman. But, unhappily, the movement of Charles had been misunderstood by Julia, and, throwing open the door, with the blindness of fear, she sprang from the carriage also: it was on the side next the water, and her first leap was over the bank; the hill was not perpendicular, but too steep for Julia to recover her balance--and partly running, and partly falling, the unfortunate girl was plunged into the rapid river. Charles heard the screams of Miss Emmerson, and caught a glimpse of the dress of Julia as she sprang from the carriage. He ran to the bank just in time to see her fall into the water.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with vortices in steady two dimensional inviscid incompressible flow. In the first three chapters, separated vortex flows are considered {{in the context of}} inviscid flow past two dimensional airfoils for which the action of the vortex is to induce large lift. In the fourth and last chapter, we consider vortices in uniform flow {{in the absence of any}} physical bodies. In chapter I, we consider two configurations of vortices for flow past a flat plate with a forward facing flap attached to its rear edge. In the first case, case (a), we consider a potential vortex in the vicinity of the airfoil, while for case (b), we consider a vortex sheet coming off the leading edge of the plate and reattaching at the leading edge of the flap such that the region between the vortex sheet and the airfoil is stagnant. For case (a), the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation is used to find exact solutions to the flow problem. It is found that by suitably placing a potential vortex of appropriate strength it is possible to satisfy the Kutta condition of finite velocity at both the leading edges of the plate and the flap in addition to satisfying it at the trailing edge, provided the plate flap combination satisfies a geometric constraint. The action of the potential vortex is to create a large circulatory region bounded by the airfoil and the streamline that separates smoothly at the leading edge of the plate (due to the Kutta condition) and reattaches smoothly at the leading edge of the flap (from the Kutta condition again). The circulation induced at infinity for such a flow and hence the lift on the airfoil is found to be very large. For case (b), where the vortex sheet location is unknown, a hodograph method is used to find exact solutions. It is found that once a geometric constraint is satisfied, flows exist for which the Kutta condition is satisfied at the trailing edge of the plate-flap combination. As in (a), large values of lift are obtained. However, in both cases (a) and (b), the adverse pressure gradient of <b>top</b> of the <b>flap</b> is recognized as a source of potential difficulty in the experimental realization of the calculated flow. In chapter II, successive modifications are made to the airfoil considered in chapter I. Exact solutions are once again obtained by a variation of the hodograph method of chapter 1. The lift for these airfoils is found to be significantly larger than the one in chapter 1. Because the trailing edge is no longer a stagnation point, it is felt that these flows may be easier to realize experimentally. Chapter III {{is concerned with}} the so-called Prandtl-Batchelor flow past the plate-flap geometry of chapter I. The flow consists of an inner region which has a constant vorticity. The region outside of the airfoil and the vortex sheet coming off the leading edge of plate and reattaching at the leading edge of the flap (as in chapter I) is once again irrotational. The common boundary between the exterior flow and the inner flow, i. e. the vortex sheet, is unknown a priori and is determined by continuity of pressure, which translates into a nonlinear boundary condition on an unknown boundary. By extending the function theoretic approach of complex variables to this problem, we reduce the entire problem into one of determining one unknown function of one variable on a fixed domain from which everything else can be calculated. This is then solved numerically. Our calculations provide what we believe to be the first such calculation of a Prandtl-Batchelor flow. The calculations also provide a more realistic model for the vortex sheet flow considered in chapter I. Chapter IV deals with a steadily translating pair of equal but opposite vortices with uniform cores and vortex sheets on their boundaries, moving without the presence of any physical boundary. The solutions were found for such flows using the function theoretic approach introduced earlier in chapter III for flows where the velocity on the vortex sheet is not a constant. The solutions form a continuum between the hollow vortex case of Pocklington (1898) and those of Deem & Zabusky (1978) and Pierrehumbert (1980) who consider uniform core with no vortex sheet. The iterative scheme for numerical calculation, however, turns out to have severe limitations, as it fails to converge for the cases with no vortex sheet or when the vortex sheet strength is small. In the last section of the chapter, a more traditional approach due to Deem & Zabusky is taken to calculate a pair of touching vortices with uniform core and no vortex sheet on the boundary and an error in Pierrehumbert's (1980) calculations is pointed out. In appendix I, we point out some errors in Pocklington's paper on the motion of a hollow vortex pair. The errors are corrected and the results are found to be then in agreement with results using the method in chapter IV. ...|$|R
