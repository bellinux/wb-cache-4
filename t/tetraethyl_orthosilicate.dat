50|$|Although very {{important}} in inorganic chemistry and geochemistry, the orthosilicate ion is rarely seen in organic chemistry. Two silicate compounds, however, are used in organic synthesis: <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> or TEOS is used to link polymers, and is especially important {{in the manufacture of}} aerogels. Tetramethyl orthosilicate or TMOS is used as an alternative to TEOS, and also has a number of other uses as a reagent. TEOS is preferred over TMOS as TMOS decomposes to produce high concentrations of toxic methanol. Inhaling TMOS can result in toxic build-up of silica in the lungs.|$|E
50|$|The {{black coating}} on the tiles was Reaction Cured Glass (RCG) of which tetrasilicide and {{borosilicate}} glass {{were some of}} several ingredients. RCG was applied to all but {{one side of the}} tile to protect the porous silica and to increase the heat sink properties. The coating was absent from a small margin of the sides adjacent to the uncoated (bottom) side. To waterproof the tile, dimethylethoxysilane was injected into the tiles by syringe. Densifying the tile with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> (TEOS) also helped to protect the silica and added additional waterproofing.|$|E
50|$|In 2015 a {{prototype}} electrode was demonstrated {{that consists of}} sponge-like silicon nanofibers increases Columbic efficiency and avoids the physical damage from silicon's expansion/contractions. The nanofibers were created by applying a high voltage between a rotating drum and a nozzle emitting a solution of <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> (TEOS). The material was then exposed to magnesium vapors. The nanofibers contain 10 nm diameter nanopores on their surface. Along with additional gaps in the fiber network, these allow for silicon to expand without damaging the cell. Three other factors reduce expansion: a 1 nm shell of silicon dioxide; a second carbon coating that creates a buffer layer; and the 8-25 nm fiber size, which is below the size at which silicon tends to fracture.|$|E
50|$|The {{sol-gel process}} {{has a long}} history of use for {{synthesis}} of silicate systems and other oxides and it has become a widely spread research field with high technological relevance, for example for the fabrication of thin films, coatings, nanoparticles and fibers. Sol-gel processing technology at low temperatures, an alternative to traditional melt processing of glasses, involves the synthesis of a solution (sol), typically composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors followed by the formation of a gel by chemical reaction or aggregation, and lastly thermal treatment for drying, organic removal, and sometimes crystallization and cooling treatment. The synthesis of specific silicate bioactive glasses by the sol-gel technique at low temperatures using metal alkoxides as precursors was shown in 1991 by Li et al. For the synthesis of bioactive glasses, typical precursors used are <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate,</b> calcium nitrate and triethylphosphate. After hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions a gel is formed which subsequently is calcinated at 600-700̊ C to form the glass. Based on the preparation method, sol-gel derived products, e.g. thin films or particles are highly porous exhibiting a high specific surface area. Recent work on fabricating bioactive silicate glass nanoparticles by sol-gel process has been carried out by Hong et al. In their research, nanoscale bioactive glass particles were obtained by the combination of two steps; sol-gel route and co-precipitation method, wherein the mixture of precursors was hydrolyzed in acidic environment and condensed in alkaline condition separately, and then followed by a freeze-drying process. The morphology and size of bioactive glass nanoparticles could be tailored by varying the production conditions and the feeding ratio of reagents.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The aim of {{this study}} was to study the {{interaction}} between the silica and cobalt crystallites using a model of Co 3 O 4 -nanocubes whose surface was modified with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate.</b> The model systems were prepared in two steps, viz. synthesis of the cobalt(III,II) oxide nanocubes via the sodium dodecylsulphate assisted oxidative precipitation and a surface modification of the nanocubes with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate.</b> The obtained morphology and in particular the average crystallite size of Co 3 O 4 nanocubes is affected by the temperature at which the reagents are mixed, the rate at which they are mixed as well as the time of reaction. The modification of the surface of the Co 3 O 4 -nanocubes with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate</b> resulted in the formation of Co-O-Si ligands on the surface of Co 3 O 4. This was confirmed in addition to (amorphous) SiO 2 using Fourier transformer infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. The surface treatment did not yield the formation of crystalline silica or a crystalline cobalt silicate phase as indicated by the absence of characteristic diffraction bands using XRD. Furthermore, there was no hard-to reduce material (e. g. cobalt silicate) as the TPR profiles showed only two peaks corresponding to the reduction of Co 3 O 4 to metallic cobalt. The reduction behaviour of Co 3 O 4 nano-cubes was, however, affected by the surface treatment with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate.</b> A shift in the reduction profile towards higher temperatures was observed with increasing SiO 2 loading. This occurs as a result of increased activation energy for the reduction of the model catalysts upon modifying with <b>tetraethyl</b> <b>orthosilicate,</b> which might be ascribed to a strong interaction between cobalt and silica. Surface modification of Co 3 O 4 with SiO 2 prohibits sintering and the silica species may act as spacers between the cobalt particles. The Co-O-Si species are still present after the reduction of these model materials and during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The Fischer-Tropsch activity is improved with a maximum activity improvement of about 15 times. The activity enhancement is larger than what is expected based on the increased metal surface area indicating that Co-O-Si surface species may also act as a promoter for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis...|$|E
