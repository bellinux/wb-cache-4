25|$|The belated firman, {{permitting}} the building, finally arrived on 27 October 1898, after attempts of Templers <b>to</b> <b>baffle</b> the planned constructions, however, {{too late for}} an imperial attendance in the laying of the cornerstone.|$|E
25|$|The plot is {{a typical}} Wodehouse romance, with Psmith inveigling himself into the idyllic castle, where there are the usual crop of girls to woo, crooks to foil, imposters to unmask, haughty aunts <b>to</b> <b>baffle</b> and {{valuable}} necklaces to steal. Among the players is Psmith's good friend Mike, married to Phyllis and {{in dire need of}} some financial help; the ever-suspicious Rupert Baxter is on watch as usual.|$|E
25|$|In the 1939 season, however, Mitchell {{did not do}} {{much work}} because Derbyshire's pace attack was so {{consistently}} effective and he failed to take 100 wickets {{for the first time}} in 11 seasons. Moreover, when he refused to rejoin the team after World War II, the Derbyshire committee declined to give Mitchell the benefit he had been due to receive in 1940. He did, though, continue <b>to</b> <b>baffle</b> batsmen for Hickleton Main well into his fifties.|$|E

25|$|Muralitharan {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>baffle</b> batsman {{outside the}} shores of Sri Lanka, irrespective of the team's performance. In Sri Lanka's humiliating drubbing {{at the hands of}} India in 1993–94, where all three Tests were innings defeats, Muralitharan was the sole success, with 12 wickets in the rubber. His perseverance in the face of some astronomical scores by the fearsome quartet of Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Navjot Sidhu and Vinod Kambli was {{in sharp contrast to the}} submission with which his team-mates played the series.|$|E
25|$|Leopold put {{pressure}} on Great Britain by threatening to cede {{his part of the}} Low Countries to France. Then, when sure of British support, he was in a position <b>to</b> <b>baffle</b> the intrigues of Prussia. A personal appeal to Frederick William II led to a conference between them at Reichenbach in July 1790, and to an arrangement which was in fact a defeat for Prussia: Leopold's coronation as king of Hungary on 11 November 1790, preceded by a settlement with the Diet in which he recognized the dominant position of the Magyars. He had already made an eight months' truce with the Turks in September, which prepared the way for the termination of the war begun by Joseph II. The pacification of his eastern dominions left Leopold free to re-establish order in Belgium and to confirm friendly relations with Britain and the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|Outside the US, {{the episode}} also {{prompted}} a polarized response. The BBC's Entertainment reporter Kev Geoghegan {{felt that the}} episode was [...] "emotionally satisfying" [...] and that [...] "the show was wrapped up rather nicely". Michael Deacon in The Daily Telegraph was [...] "beatifically surprised" [...] at the [...] "great" [...] ending. Shane Hegarty in The Irish Times felt that the final scene was [...] "somewhat of a letdown", comparing it to the recent similar ending of Ashes to Ashes and contrasting it with the last ever episode of The Sopranos. He remarked: [...] " [...] was not about mystery, but its final scene was so inscrutable that fans are still squinting {{in an effort to}} figure it out. Losts finale, though, was not too obtuse." [...] Some reviewers ended puzzled about the meaning of Lost. Tim Teeman in The Times referred to [...] "a global scratching of heads" [...] in his review but concluded [...] "The questions are ceaseless: it may be healthier, as one online fan put it, 'to just accept it and move on. Steve Busfield and Richard Vine of The Guardian spoke positively about the episode, saying that the series would [...] "continue <b>to</b> <b>baffle,</b> infuriate and delight fans for an eternity". Conversely, the TV critic Charlie Brooker, also writing for The Guardian, remarked that [...] "The End" [...] plot [...] "made less sense than a milk hammock", while the comedian Danny Baker called the episode [...] "an outrage".|$|E

60|$|The officer {{attended}} the Deputy {{to the door}} of his cabriolet, and in his hearing Caron bade the coachman drive to the Porte St. Martin. This, however, {{was no more than a}} subterfuge to which he was resorting with a view <b>to</b> <b>baffling</b> the later possibility of their being traced. Ombreval naturally enough plied him with questions as they went, to which La Boulaye returned such curt answers that in the end, discouraged and offended, the nobleman became silent.|$|R
2500|$|The Fragile {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Mojo called it [...] "an impressively multi-textured, satisfyingly violent sonic workout", and Alternative Press found it [...] "nothing short of astounding". Edna Gundersen of USA Today called it [...] "meticulously honed and twisted <b>to</b> <b>baffle,</b> tantalize, disarm and challenge the listener", and wrote that [...] "the coats of polish ... can't camouflage Trent Reznor's perverse and subversive paths to musical glory." [...] Ann Powers of Spin called the album [...] "a good old-fashioned strap-on-your-headphones experience". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that, although he [...] "doesn't approach suicide {{as he did}} on" [...] The Downward Spiral, [...] "Reznor can hide {{in the studio and}} piece together music that's as cunning, and disquieting, as his raw anger used to be." [...] Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly viewed that, even [...] "if [...] emotional palette is limited, it remains broader than any of his metalhead peers", and that, [...] "right now, hard rock simply doesn't get any smarter, harder, or more ambitious than this." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that, despite its length, [...] "this is a profoundly challenging and moving work that strikes at the hollowness of most contemporary pop-rock with bullwhip force." [...] The Guardians Adam Sweeting praised it as [...] "a fearsomely accomplished mix of monster riffing, brooding melodies and patches of minimalist soul-searching". Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield felt that the album's [...] "excess is Reznor's chosen shock tactic here, and what's especially shocking is how much action he packs into his digital via dolorosa." ...|$|E

40|$|Particle {{suspension}} in liquids is a {{unit operation}} commonly {{encountered in the}} process industry. Although it is usually carried out in baffled stirred tanks, there are some specific applications where the presence of baffles may be undesirable. In the present work solid−liquid suspensions are investigated in a radially stirred unbaffled tank provided with a top cover. The minimum impeller speed at which all solid particles get suspended (Njs) and the relevant power requirements (Pjs) are assessed. The dependence of these two parameters on physical properties (liquid viscosity, particle concentration, and size) and system geometrical configurations (impeller diameter and clearance) is investigated, and a correlation for the Njs estimation is proposed. Results mark some notable differences with respect <b>to</b> <b>baffled</b> tanks: Njs appears to be almost independent of particle diameter, a feature that may suggest the adoption of unbaffled tanks when large heavy particles are to be dealt with. Also, Njs was found to decrease as liquid viscosity increases, once again marking a favorable discrepancy with respect <b>to</b> <b>baffled</b> vessels. As concerns the system geometrical configuration, a tank stirred by a D = T/ 3 six-bladed Rushton turbine offset by T/ 3 from the tank bottom {{is found to be}} the most convenient configuration among those investigated in this work. Present results are finally compared with literature information on solids suspension in baffled or unsteadily agitated unbaffled systems. In both cases, top-covered unbaffled stirred vessels are found to be a convenient choice, provided that mixing times are not a controlling factor...|$|R
