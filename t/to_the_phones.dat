50|$|Verizon Wireless {{disabled}} certain {{features on}} the V3m including the ability to transfer data files {{to and from the}} phone via Bluetooth (a specific protocol called OBEX).

In the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proceeding the Second Computer Inquiry, the FCC ruled that telecommunications carriers could no longer bundle CPE with telecommunications service, uncoupling the market power of the telecommunications service monopoly from the CPE market, and creating a competitive CPE market.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results and conclusions of a study on speech segmentation system for Arabic speech. Automatic phonetic segmentation {{is the problem of}} automatically locating the boundaries between the sounds corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> that make up a fragment of speech. The developed system accepts a speech utterance and its orthographic transcription, and generates its phonemic transcription and the segmentation information of the utterance. The system was trained using a corpus of Arabic TV news. A phonetic dictionary was also developed using orthographic-to-phonemic transcription rules. The corpus is used to develop context-independent hidden Markov models for the Arabic phonemes. The system was validated against manually segmented speech utterances...|$|E
