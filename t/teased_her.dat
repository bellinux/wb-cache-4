5|$|Revithi {{arrived at}} the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9April , where the athletes had already {{assembled}} for the following day's race. She {{attracted the attention of}} the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri <b>teased</b> <b>her,</b> predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E

Yuki takes an early interest in Yoshino when she believes Yoshino to be a boy, though remains on good terms with Yoshino even after learning of Yoshino's assigned sex, and gives Shuichi and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls <b>teased</b> <b>her</b> and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{married her}} third husband, Charles F. Blair, Jr., 11 years her senior, on 12 March 1968.

A few years after her {{marriage}} to Blair, O'Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of The Quiet Man, a story is recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford <b>teased</b> <b>her</b> about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help run his business. Blair died in 1978 while flying a Grumman Goose for his airline from St. Croix to St. Thomas, crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the U.S.|$|E

2500|$|While {{encouraged}} by her family, Walker's wardrobe choices were often met with criticism. Once, a schoolteacher, she was assaulted {{on her way}} home by a neighboring farmer and a group of boys, who chased her and attacked her with eggs and other missiles. Female colleagues in medical school criticized her choices, and patients often gawked at her and <b>teased</b> <b>her.</b> She nevertheless persisted in her mission to reform women's dress. Her view that women's dress should [...] "protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it" [...] made her commitment to dress reform as great as her zeal for abolitionism. She famously wrote to the women's journal, The Sibyl: A Review of the Tastes, Errors, and Fashions of Society, about her campaign against women's fashion, amongst other things, for its injuries to health, its expense, and its contribution to the dissolution of marriages. Her literature contributed to the spread of her ideas, and made her a popular figure amongst other feminists and female physicians.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 Dec 2012, after {{numerous}} rumors {{on whether}} she had tied the knot 2 months ago, {{in an interview with}} the press, she declared that now it can be said that she is married and has worn a wedding ring for two months. Some paparazzi pointed out that this can be easily recognized when she started wearing a more plain ring which matches the ring on Otto's (her husband) left hand though she may have intended to wear it on her right hand (yet, wearing ring on the right hand is actually a tradition in some Europe countries including the Netherlands). It is also expected that Thu Minh would never hold a big wedding celebration involving the public and the press in Vietnam since she is well known for being quite secretive in her love life. This could be a reason that she may have chosen to celebrate this only with some close friends and families − to avoid the public attention. Besides, because Thu Minh only has contact regularly with very few co-workers at a personal level, the news, hence, was not widespread and was under cover for a while. Till now, the public only acknowledges her husband's face and he is a Dutch businessman (Her husband's name has recently been revealed as Otto). Her husband appeared on the event she held on 21 December 2012 as an event to introduce her husband and celebrate the ended year 2012. In this event, he also spoke sincerely in Vietnamese though not much to thank the press, but expressed his willing to keep their relationship secretive. He also called Thu Minh his wife and <b>teased</b> <b>her</b> for being talkative ...|$|E
