40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the interrelation between <b>teat</b> anatomy and machine milking in dairy buffaloes raised in Switzerland. A 3 -min pre-stimulation induced milk ejection before cluster attachment in most cases and caused an optimal milk removal during machine milking. In an additional experiment, longitudinal cross-section ultrasound was obtained before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation. <b>Teat</b> wall thickness, <b>teat</b> diameter, cisternal diameter and <b>teat</b> canal length were evaluated. It was observed that 3 -min pre-stimulation dramatically reduced <b>teat</b> canal length whereas all the other anatomical parameters remained unchanged. The vacuum needed to open the <b>teat</b> canal was also measured before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation by using a special <b>teat</b> cup with only the mouthpiece of the liner remaining {{on the top of the}} <b>teat</b> cup (no liner, no pulsation). Without pre-stimulation but after wetting the <b>teat</b> canal by stripping one squirt of milk out of the <b>teat,</b> no milk could be withdrawn with a vacuum up to 39 kPa. However, after pre-stimulation, milk flow occurred in all buffaloes at a vacuum between 16 and 38 kPa. In the last experiment, the <b>teat</b> tissue was examined in slaughtered buffaloes and compared with <b>teat</b> tissue of cows. No difference was noted in histological sections and <b>teat</b> canal length was similar in cows and buffaloes. Proximal to the <b>teat</b> canal, the <b>teat</b> did not pass into an open cistern but the lumen was collapsed. In conclusion, buffaloes need to be well pre-stimulated because the tissue above the <b>teat</b> canal provides additional <b>teat</b> closure before milk ejection.

5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11â€“14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears.

5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six <b>teats</b> for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

40|$|Winter {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} rapid dehydration and cracking of <b>teat</b> tissue, thus increasing mastitis risks. The objectives of these three winter trials were to compare application of a new novel commercial winter <b>teat</b> dip (1 % iodine, 50 % glycerine) to three existing commercially available winter <b>teat</b> dips and best management winter milking practices. Overall results for the 3 trials showed similar <b>teat</b> skin and end conditions (except <b>teat</b> skin in trial 5) for the 1 % iodine, 50 % glycerine dip as compared to 3 commercial winter <b>teat</b> dips.

40|$|The <b>teat</b> canal is {{the primary}} {{physical}} and chemical barrier to invasion of mastitis pathogens into the udder (Hamann, 1987). Between milkings, the smooth muscles surrounding the <b>teat</b> duct should be contracted and the <b>teat</b> canal tightly closed to impede bacterial passage from the <b>teat</b> orifice into {{the interior of the}} gland (Nickerson, 1994). A teat-end in good condition is an important resistance factor to bacterial colonization of the mammary gland (Michel et al., 1974). Changes in <b>teat</b> tissue by milking, <b>teat</b> canal integrity, and <b>teat</b> tissue pliability may favour penetration of bacteria into the udder (Oâ€™Shea et al., 1987). Veterinarians and others require a simple and reliable method for evaluating <b>teat</b> health in dairy herds. A complete protocol for systematic evaluation of <b>teat</b> condition in commercial herds is proposed by a group of international experts on <b>teat</b> condition (Mein et al., 2001). The new protocol includes an assessment of teat-end callosity (TEC). The evaluation of teat-end callosity is based on a research classification system.

50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{work in a}} {{way that}} is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the <b>teat</b> by creating a pressure difference across the <b>teat</b> canal (or opening at the end of the <b>teat).</b> Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow. The vacuum applied to the <b>teat</b> causes congestion of <b>teat</b> tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of <b>teat</b> and relieve congestion in the <b>teat</b> tissue.

40|$|Application of an {{iodophor}} <b>teat</b> dip {{before and}} after milking is a common practice in the dairy industry as an effective method of preventing mastitis by reducing microbial populations at the <b>teat</b> end.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a new conditioning component in iodophor <b>teat</b> dips containing either 0. 5 % or 1. 0 % iodine. Two experiments were conducted during late winter (133 cows) and during summer (104 cows) to evaluate two new iodophor <b>teat</b> dips developed by KO Manufacturing, Inc., Springfield, Mo. The two <b>teat</b> dips contain a nontraditional conditioning agent designed to sustain the lipid bilayer of the <b>teat</b> skin and improve skin condition. Dinerin (0. 5 % iodine) was equally effective as Westfalia-Surge Derma-Kote during the winter study in preventing new mammary infections based on the number of new clinical cases of mastitis and somatic cell counts. <b>Teat</b> and <b>teat</b> end condition were similarly maintained by both <b>teat</b> dips during the winter study.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>teat</b> end health and skin conditioning performance of two experimental heptanoic acid based <b>teat</b> dips vs the commercial product Remain Gold Â® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic acid <b>teat</b> dips KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar <b>teat</b> end health and <b>teat</b> skin conditioning to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in <b>teat</b> end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate skin conditioning performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported <b>teat</b> skin studies rely on comparing <b>teat</b> dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage.
