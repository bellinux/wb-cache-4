40|$|<b>Trunk</b> media <b>gateway.</b> This {{contribution}} updates/replaces {{the previous}} GMI 2002 Implementation agreement for Megaco/H 248 for a Media Gateway Controller/Trunking <b>gateway</b> using IP <b>trunks</b> (document: MSF-IA-MEGACO. 003 -FINAL) {{and has been}} amended and updated to include interoperability issues seen at GMI 2004. The goal of the MSF is to promote multi-vendor interoperability {{as part of a}} drive to accelerate the deployment of next generation networks. To this end the MSF looks to adopt pragmatic solutions in order to maximize the chances for early deployment in real world networks. To date the MSF has defined a number of detailed Implementation Agreements and detailed Test Plans for the signaling protocols between network components and is developing additional Implementation Agreements and Test Plans addressing some of the other technical issues such as QoS and Security to assist vendors and operators in deploying interoperable solutions. The MSF welcomes feedback and comment and would encourage interested parties to get involved in this work program.

50|$|The first {{catamaran}} {{was built}} in Norway between the autumn of 2005 and the spring of 2006. The routing was across Skagerrak, on the Northern Sea after the channel Rhine-Main-Danube to Vienna. For this and due to the weight, the shipyard of Norwegian Båtservice Mandal developed a high speed catamaran in aluminium with a hydrojet which {{can also be used}} in summer at low tide. The sinking depth in water guaranteed by the contract is 80 cm. To minimize the impact of the waves, complex model tests of the Austrian Institute for Maritime Technology (Schiffbautechnische Versuchsanstalta) took place. The catamaran is totally climate-controlled, and can accommodate 106 passengers and crew (a captain, two sailors and catering staff).On May 14, 2007, the Twin City Liner failed in Vienna, in the district of Erdberg, on the right bank of the Danube Canal and had to be rescued by firemen from Vienna. After repair and administrative authorization, it was returned to service. A similar accident occurred July 28, 2009, when the captain tried to avoid a floating tree <b>trunk</b> near the <b>gateway</b> Erdberg.|$|R
