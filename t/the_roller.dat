5|$|As {{construction}} progressed {{with the}} theme park in early 2013, {{the owners of the}} park gave no details about <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster other than that it would be the largest roller coaster in India. Even after <b>the</b> <b>Roller</b> Coaster Database reported that a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster would be built at the park, the owners still released no details. In April 2013, the first pieces of <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster were erected. By the end of August, all of the coaster's track was installed. Then {{in the third quarter of}} 2013, Adlabs Imagica released the details of Nitro.|$|E
5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster {{track and}} {{attraction}} buildings began in September 2008. Superior Rigging & Erection built the supports and track. The ride's layout {{was completed in}} December 2008, and construction on other parts of <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster continued into early 2009. SeaWorld began previewing the attraction in early May 2009, before it was officially opened on May 22.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, Universal {{confirmed}} that <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster would not open as originally planned {{and said it}} would open in the summer.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an end-effector and {{a method for}} manipulating deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-effector, designed for applications in the U. S. Postal Service, comprises two parallel rollers with gripping sur-faces, where <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> are pushed towards each other. When the end-effector comes onto contact with any portion of the deformable object, <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> turn inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between <b>the</b> <b>rollers.</b> When sufficient material is caught between <b>the</b> <b>rollers,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> stop rotating, whereby <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> then hold <b>the</b> graspable portion of the object allowing the object to be maneuvered by the robot.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a new class}} of end-effectors that can be used with robotic and material handling devices for grabbing and holding deformable objects with undefined shapes such as sacks and bags. These end-effectors can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack and regardless of the sack orientation and position. The first prototype end-effector, designed for U. S. Postal Service, has two <b>rollers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rollers</b> are pushed toward each other by the force of a spring. When <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> are powered to spin, the inward spinning of <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> causes <b>the</b> sack material to be dragged in between <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> due to <b>the</b> friction between the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> and <b>the</b> sack material. The spring pushes <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> toward each other with sufficient force to hold the sack material in place be...|$|R
50|$|One of the draw-backs of the {{distribution}} of <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> is that <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> cannot be stacked efficiently to save space; thus transport capacity is wasted.|$|R

50|$|Many pouch {{laminators}} {{require the}} use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps prevent the hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up <b>the</b> <b>rollers.</b> <b>The</b> carrier prevents <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> inside <b>the</b> laminator.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> other <b>roller</b> screw types above, loads are {{transferred}} from the nut through <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> to <b>the</b> screw (or in the reverse order).

5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added with fire, crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of <b>the</b> <b>roller</b> coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E
50|$|A scrollerwheel is a {{mechanical}} device {{composed of a}} number of rollers (four or more) and connective bands under tension, which wrap around and weave between <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> forming a self-supporting cluster possessing a central <b>roller.</b> <b>The</b> cluster of <b>rollers</b> is bound by the connective bands {{in such a way that}} the static friction between <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> and bands prevent <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> from slipping as they roll and orbit <b>the</b> central <b>roller.</b> Scrollerwheels are related in operational principle to rolamite linear bearings (developed at Sandia National Labs in the late 1960s), and like them, they display only rolling friction, and not the kinetic friction inherent in most mechanical bearings.|$|R
50|$|Needle roller {{bearings}} use {{very long and}} thin cylinders. Often the ends of <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> taper to points, and these are used to keep <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> captive, {{or they may be}} hemispherical and not captive but held by the shaft itself or a similar arrangement. Since <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> are thin, <b>the</b> outside diameter of the bearing is only slightly larger than the hole in the middle. However, <b>the</b> small-diameter <b>rollers</b> must bend sharply where they contact the races, and thus the bearing fatigues relatively quickly.|$|R
50|$|RollersSimilar in colour to the bee-eaters but {{resembling}} crows in {{size and}} shape are <b>the</b> <b>rollers,</b> family Coraciidae. Among the most well-known is <b>the</b> lilac-breasted <b>roller</b> and <b>the</b> European <b>roller.</b> They hawk for insects from perches.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rollers</b> are {{stabilized}} and {{restrained by}} a flange {{on the inner}} ring, against which their large end slides, which stops <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> from popping out due to the [...] "pumpkin seed effect" [...] of their conical shape.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rollers</b> act as <b>the</b> “threads” of the nut assembly, causing axial {{movement}} of the rotating screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation spins <b>the</b> <b>rollers,</b> which spin <b>the</b> bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|R
50|$|Inverted roller screws {{operate on}} the same {{principles}} of standard roller screws except that {{the function of the}} nut and screw is reversed in relation to <b>the</b> <b>rollers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rollers</b> move axially within the nut, which is elongated to accommodate the full extent of screw shaft travel. The threaded portion of the screw shaft is limited to the threaded length of <b>the</b> <b>rollers.</b> <b>The</b> non-threaded portion of the screw shaft can be a smooth or non-cylindrical shape. The ring gear is replaced by gear teeth above and below the threaded portion of the screw shaft.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a novel robotic end-effector and {{a method for}} grasping deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry, such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-ef-fector, designed for applications in the U. S.

When the end-effector comes into contact with any portion of the deformable object, <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> turn inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between <b>the</b> <b>rollers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rollers</b> stop rotating when a graspable por-tion of the material/object is caught in between, allowing the ob-ject to be maneuvered by the robot. The object is released when <b>the</b> <b>rollers</b> turn outwardly. <b>The</b> end-effector described in this ar-ticle can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack, re-gardless of the sack’s orientation. Experimental evaluation of the end-effector has proven the design and implementation remark...|$|R

It reopened as Borg Assimilator – the first coaster {{in the world}} to be themed to Star Trek – on March 20, 2004. After Cedar Fair purchased Carowinds in 2006, Paramount themes were soon removed from the park, and the ride was renamed Nighthawk. It is one of only three Flying Dutchman models still in existence from Vekoma.|$|E
5000|$|Buckle folders work {{by feeding}} the paper {{at high speeds}} until it can move no further; the {{reaction}} of the paper is to buckle.
