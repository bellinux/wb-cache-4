25|$|In 1854, {{a disease}} {{spread through the}} cattle of the Xhosa. It was {{believed}} to have spread from cattle owned by the Settlers. Widespread cattle deaths resulted, and the Xhosa believed that the deaths were caused by ubuthi, or witchcraft. In April, 1856 two girls, one named Nongqawuse, went to scare birds out of the fields. When she returned, she told her uncle Mhlakaza that she had met three spirits at <b>the</b> <b>bushes,</b> <b>and</b> that they {{had told her that}} all cattle should be slaughtered, and their crops destroyed. On the day following the destruction, the dead Xhosa would return and help expel the whites. The ancestors would bring cattle with them to replace those that had been killed. Mhlakaza believed the prophecy, and repeated it to the chief Sarhili.|$|E

The town maintains Blanco's tradition and is now an attraction. In Sarchí, national and international tourists can visit the country's traditional artisan shops. Geometrically painted oxcarts, furniture, and other crafts are some of the artisanal products built in Sarchí. In the municipality of Palmares, there is a large festival every January. The festival has been going on since 1987 and has live music, horse parades, and other traditional events that attract nearly 20,000 visitors each year. Many visitors and businesses go to San Carlos in April each year for an annual cattle market.

[...] The Americans opened fire first with the artillery, and then with musket volleys. [...] The battle continued for about 45 minutes, at which point the Americans were running low on ammunition. [...] Moultrie had begun a withdrawal when the British were also observed to retreat, leaving the field to the Americans. [...] A company of light horse militia chased after the British, very nearly cutting them off from their boats. [...] They successfully captured 26 men, but were unable to hold all of them due to their small numbers.|$|E

2500|$|The newly {{appointed}} Governor-General Camilo de Polavieja now {{fully aware that}} the main weight of the revolution is in Cavite, decided to launch a two-pronged assault which will defeat the revolutionaries led by Aguinaldo. He ordered [...] General José de Lachambre with a much bigger force to march against Silang {{to take on the}} Katipuneros from the rear, while he himself will engaged the Filipinos head on. On February 17, 1897, Aguinaldo ordered soldiers to plant dynamite along the bridge and place pointed bamboo sticks in the river beds below the bridge. Several hours later, 12,000 Spaniards began to cross the bridge. The trap was sprung and the dynamite was detonated, killing several Spanish troops and injuring many more. The rebels then emerged from <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>and</b> fought hand-to-hand, repelling consecutive waves of enemy troops charging across the river. During this fight Edilberto Evangelista {{was shot in the head}} and died. The province of Cavite gradually emerged as the Revolution's hotbed, and the Aguinaldo-led katipuneros had a string of victories there. After the battle, the demoralized Spanish soldiers retreated towards Muntinlupa.|$|E

Meanwhile, Amor is sneaking around in disguise, spying on Marte. He is eventually discovered hiding in <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>and</b> interrogated by Marte, who fails to recognize him, but is suspicious of his riddles about love. When Marte orders the soldiers to capture him, Amor escapes into a cleft in the mountain. The cleft then opens revealing the Prison of Jealousy. Shackled inside, is Desengaño (Disillusion), an old man [...] dressed in animal skins. Marte and Dragón fearfully enter the grotto and find the masked personifications of Fear, Suspicion, Envy, Anger, and Bitterness. Desengaño and the masked figures warn Marte that when love is pursued it turns into disillusion. Desengaño holds up a magic mirror in which Marte sees Venus and Adonis embracing. Unable to face the truth, Marte runs away. There is a sudden earthquake, and the allegorical figures, the vision in the mirror, and the grotto all disappear.|$|E
2500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Joe Tiernan claims that Cleary {{was part of}} the three-man IRA unit that ambushed and killed part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) corporal Robert McConnell in the garden of his home at Tullyvallen, near Newtownhamilton. Cleary and his team hid in <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> <b>and</b> when McConnell appeared, Cleary shot him twice in the head, killing him. McConnell had allegedly been a member of both the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade and the Glenanne gang, both of which carried out sectarian killings. In 1993 Yorkshire Television aired a programme, The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre, which implicated McConnell in the 1974 Dublin car bombings. The narrator also claimed McConnell was an Intelligence Corps agent with links to Captain Robert Nairac. RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir affirmed this in an affidavit and named McConnell as the perpetrator of a series of sectarian attacks. He also alleged that McConnell had been set up by the Intelligence Corps who passed on confidential information about McConnell to the IRA, through Nairac, in an attempt to infiltrate the organisation. [...] Upon receiving this information, the IRA ordered the execution of McConnell.|$|E
