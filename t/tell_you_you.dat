In January 2017 he said “Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> {{take on the}} {{intelligence}} community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments. Later that month he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.|$|E
500|$|Balked again, Butler {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, [...] "Yes, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> cowardly hound, why I took them , and I'll meet you wherever you want to. I took them because I, as governor of the State, {{could not afford to}} create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{physical}} attractiveness {{and sexual}} appeal were widely acknowledged. [...] "He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful", {{in the words}} of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, [...] "I'm straight as an arrow and I got to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence." [...] His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as [...] "the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl." [...] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as [...] "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America." [...] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.|$|E

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> can't do that." ...|$|E

I'll let others evaluate that." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an April 23, 2010, {{debate for}} the Republican gubernatorial primary, Gibbons further {{confused}} his actual stance on Yucca Mountain by taking positions both favoring and opposing the federal waste dump over a two-minute period of time. [...] "Gibbons then {{said he believed}} nuclear waste can be transported safely and that 'I can <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> can store it safely.'" [...] However, when questioned by the moderator, Gibbons said he supported shutting down the Yucca Mountain facility.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} month, United Nations human rights experts {{called for an}} end to extrajudicial killings of {{suspected}} drug dealers, about 900 of whom had been executed since the May election, accusing Duterte of [...] "incitement to violence and killing, a crime under international law". In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations. He announced in a news conference on August 19: [...] "You now, United Nations, if you can say one bad thing about me, I can give you 10 [...] I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> are an inutil ("useless" [...] in Filipino street language.). Because if you are really true to your mandate, you could have stopped all these wars and killing [...]" [...] Asked about possible repercussions, he stated: [...] "What is ... repercussions? I don't give a shit to them." [...] He said that the UN had acted against protocol: [...] "You do not just go out and give a shitting statement against a country." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint {{managing}} director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: [...] "t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility {{and he had the}} authority". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched A Current Affair on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for A Current Affair to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: [...] "You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: [...] "I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of me as I was to get rid of him".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this goal, Nietzsche parodied a passage from the New Testament, which the Nietzsche-Archiv, headed by Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, decided to suppress so {{that there would be}} no doubt as to the strict correctness of Nietzsche's use of the Bible. According to Nietzsche, one of the thieves, who was also being crucified, said, [...] "This was truly a divine man, a child of God!" [...] Nietzsche had Christ reply, [...] "If you feel this, you are in Paradise, you are a child of God." [...] In the Bible, only Luke related a dialogue between Christ and the thief in which the thief said, [...] "This man has done nothing wrong" [...] to which, Christ replied, [...] "Today I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> will be with me in Paradise." [...] (Luke 23: 39-43) Nietzsche had the thief speaking the words that the centurion later spoke in Luke 23: 47, Matthew 27: 54, and Mark 15: 39. In these passages, Christ was called the Son of God by the soldier. The Nietzsche Archives' suppression was lifted in later editions and now appears exactly as Nietzsche wrote.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up magazine on September 2, 2011, Kevin McCall revealed {{that he had been}} collaborating [...] "heavily" [...] with Brown on the album. Later that month, producer David Banner told NeonLimeLight.com that the album will [...] "bring people back to the clubs" [...] and that it will [...] "change the way people look at R". He also revealed details of a song that he and Brown recorded for the album, saying: [...] "When I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> know how they don't play that much R in the club no more?...The song that me and Chris made, they are going to play it like they used to play Jodeci. Like they used to play Keith Sweat. The song that me and Chris made is so jamming". On January 7, 2012, Brown revealed via his official Twitter account that there was only two weeks left of recording sessions for the album, tweeting [...] "LAST TWO WEEKS of me finishing FORTUNE! I'm excited for all the fans to hear my real music". The tweet was soon followed up by another, with the singer tweeting [...] "Dub step records on my album sounding crazy!!!!". However, the tweet was later removed, suggesting that Brown gave away too much details about the album.|$|E
