One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, {{the band}} began {{recording}} their thirteenth studio album, entitled A Brief Crack of Light, in Newcastle's Blast Studio. The album recording {{was completed in}} February 2011 and mixing began in March. In late May 2011, the group announced a change of plan for the new album; another recording session was planned for June in order to record new songs that had emerged. Those songs were mixed in July 2011 and included, along with songs from the first session, for the new album. The album was released in February 2012.

500|$|The {{damage done}} by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the {{destruction}} of property. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it is a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E

500|$|On {{his role}} in the episode, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan, elaborated, [...] "I think what's funny is that he always gets what's coming to him. Like a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> happens to him, but he's like that to other people. So it's like in real life…what goes around comes around." [...] The episode {{features}} a guest-starring appearance by Kayla Ewell, who would eventually become most known for her role on The Vampire Diaries. The episode also features a guest appearance by James Jordan, as Lucky, the janitor. In season 3, Jordan would become the first actor to have two different roles on Veronica Mars when he was cast as Tim Foyle, a teaching assistant.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> {{to have to deal}} with." [...] He added, [...] "You {{want to make sure that}} it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E

500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different {{and did not want}} all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> that had happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E
500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is a <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father.

I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E

500|$|Singer {{described}} the Apt Pupils premise as a [...] "study in cruelty". He {{prepared for the}} film by reading books like the 1996 history book Hitler's Willing Executioners, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt [...] "guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did". He referred to how young Todd Bowden's interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} the infectious nature of evil... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept." [...] The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot's executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. [...] "It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them," [...] Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as [...] " [...] idea that the collective awfulness of this <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood".|$|E

2500|$|With {{the second}} part of the Disarmament Conference {{starting}} in January 1933, Baldwin attempted to see through his hope of air disarmament.

The band has been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and performed at several notable music festivals, including participating in the second annual Lollapalooza tour in 1992 and co-headlining Big Day Out in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|This period {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind Is a <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste; Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also began working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks.
