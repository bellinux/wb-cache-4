The baseline configuration is wedged. C 17510 high strength, high conductivity beryllium copper alloy developed for BPX is proposed for the conductor. These design choices were made after considering a number of alternative structural concepts {{and a variety of}} conductor materials. FIRE's high elongation and double null plasma results in high overturning moments. The use of a large compression ring and the large centering forces provides adequate frictional wedging pressures to support the inner leg out-of-plane (OOP) forces. Studies of the pulse length indicate flat top time of 12 sec at peak field and nuclear heat. Non-linear friction simulations have been performed to confirm OOP load support. Structural criteria for the FIRE reactor require demonstration of adequate ductility of the conductor material. Examination of the elastic plastic behavior of the coils for overloaded conditions, 13 T, and 14 T, has been used to satisfy this criteria, and demonstrate margin. Discussions of primary load paths and evaluation of primary stresses are presented.

HYPER is a 1 000 MWth leadbismuth eutectic (LBE) -cooled ADS. In this paper, the neutronic design characteristics of HYPER are described and its transmutation performances are assessed for an equilibrium cycle. The core {{is loaded with}} a ductless fuel assembly containing transuranics (TRU) dispersion fuel pins. In HYPER, a relatively high core height, 160 cm, is adopted to maximise the multiplication efficiency of the external source. In the ductless fuel <b>assembly,</b> 13 non-fuel <b>rods</b> are used as <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> to maintain the mechanical integrity of assembly. As the reflector material, pure lead is used to improve the neutron economy and to minimise the generation of radioactive materials. In HYPER, to minimise the burn-up reactivity swing, a B 4 C burnable absorber is employed. For efficient depletion of the B- 10 absorber, the burnable absorber is loaded only in the axially-central part (92 cm long) of the 13 <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> of each <b>assembly.</b> In the current design, {{the amount of the}} B 4 C absorber was determined such that the burn-up reactivity swing is about 3. 0 % ∆k.

40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, {{subject to}} monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present in the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The position of the cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> or Track rods are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system. Just as its name suggests a <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ties</b> vehicle’s steering rack to the steering arm. <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> may get fail due to varying forces and bumping of vehicle during steering. The forces from the steering are also considered during the static condition of car. Vibration and buckling of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> has been continuously a concern which may lead to structural failure if the resulting vibration and stresses are undesirable and excessive. So research work is aimed to assess buckling strength and compare buckling performance of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> for different materials. Finite element models of the <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> also analyzed to obtain stiffness and stress distributions in each component. Based on the experimental test results, theoretical calculation results and finite element analysis with NASTRAN results, stiffness values are validated.

In buckling analysis, the load factor obtained for different materials were compared and critical buckling load is calculated and is validated by theoretical calculations...|$|R
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|R
