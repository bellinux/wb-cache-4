5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E

She was hit six times during the battle, five times by 30.5cm shells and once by a 28.3cm shell, suffering casualties of 26 killed and 46 wounded.|$|E
5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} no less important, the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era. The games created <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> and in-depth D simulation yet, and featured support for up to six-players in cooperative mode. Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC followers and written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs. Black Isle produced a more combat-oriented series, Icewind Dale, soon thereafter.|$|E

This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> predictor of long-term effects.|$|E

5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{as they were in}} a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E

5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{made his}} second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third {{successful}} lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the lunar module Antares to <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> landing {{of the entire}} Apollo program. He became the fifth and, {{at the age of}} 47, the oldest man to walk on the moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock remained <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> timekeeper {{until the}} 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, {{the development of}} microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> source available, it must {{be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, there is often doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
