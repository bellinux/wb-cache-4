5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was moved <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>location</b> on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line.

5|$|Yerevan Square, {{where the}} robbery took place, was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet {{authorities}} in 1921, {{and a large}} statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956. Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens, near Yerevan Square. Created by the sculptor Iakob Nikoladze, it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were moved <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>location.</b> The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the final moments of the Soviet Union—and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>location</b> before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>location</b> in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation.

5|$|The {{original}} {{post office}} opened in 1847 and {{was run by}} church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory. The building, which now forms part of a Grade II* listed private dwelling, {{is thought to be}} the second-oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847. The post office briefly moved <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>location</b> in The Street under the stewardship of local schoolmistress Fanny Harris (who operated the service from 1926); however, it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub-postmistress Irene Bugden and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976. Fanny Harris (then 92 years old and the village's oldest inhabitant) and Robin Leigh-Pemberton were passengers on the first postbus service on 4 March 1974. A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20years until it was closed in the 1990s. Today, the village retains only the Blacksmiths Arms and a traditional red post box.|$|E
