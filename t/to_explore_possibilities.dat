Seven years after India's independence in 1947, the Philippines and India signed a Treaty of Friendship on 11 July 1952 in Manila {{to strengthen the}} friendly relations existing between the two countries. Soon after, the Philippine Legation in New Delhi was established and then elevated to an Embassy. However, due to foreign policy differences {{as a result of}} the bipolar alliance structure of the Cold War, the development of bilateral relations was stunted. It was only in 1976 that relations started to normalise when Aditya Birla, one of India's successful industrialists, met with then President Ferdinand E.

500|$|In {{his book}} Approaching the Possible, Jo Storm saw the episode's title hinting at an [...] "inevitable" [...] story line about the sexual tension between O'Neill and Carter {{that has been}} looming since the {{beginning}} of the series. The characters [...] "break the rules of conduct for their jobs" [...] (fraternization) made the episode [...] "seem completely unnatural", while it allowed the writers <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the narrative. Jo Storm also credited the writers for breaking the [...] "boring" [...] convention of getting either only one or all teammembers caught in a time loop. The producers enjoyed having O'Neill and Teal'c instead of the usual intellectual combination of Carter and Daniel solve the puzzle. Peter DeLuise regarded the episode as [...] "funnier" [...] and [...] "more lighthearted" [...] than usual episodes.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{start of}} the nuclear weapons program {{occurred}} in 1948. In February, the FOA's board decided to turn defense research toward work on nuclear weapons, {{perhaps because of the}} divisions that occurred between FOA and AB Atomenergi. Only {{a few days after the}} decision, the Commander-in-Chief, Nils Swedlund, assigned the FOA <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> <b>possibilities</b> for Sweden to acquire nuclear weapons. The exploration was carried out quickly, and on May 4, 1948, the report was finalized with Gustaf Ljunggren (Chief of FOA 1, Department of Chemistry) and Torsten Magnusson (Chief of FOA 2) as signatories. Central in the investigation was that they advocated for investing in nuclear weapons based on plutonium rather than on highly enriched uranium (U-235) since the uranium option turned out to be technically more difficult. The investigation also included a summarized plan for a Swedish nuclear weapons project with primary estimates of time and expenses. According to the report,the time framework was determined by the installation of reactors, mining of the raw material for them and production of plutonium in the reactors rather than the construction of the nuclear weapon itself. The contributing factor for this estimate was [...] the misestimated critical mass of a plutonium pit, believing it to be 20–50kg instead of the actual 6kg.|$|E
