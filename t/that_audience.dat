5|$|All That Glitters, after {{initially}} capturing 20% {{of viewers}} in major markets in its opening weeks, had lost {{about half of}} <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> midway through its run. The series was cancelled after 13 weeks, last airing on July 15, 1977. Although the show was panned, it and Lear, along with Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, are credited with expanding the subject matter that television producers were able to explore with lessened fear of antagonizing sponsors or viewers.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh {{went against}} the {{expectations}} of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not {{willing to work with}} him after his two previous flops. He also believed <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} share of audience, the {{broadcast}} represented over 50% {{of the total}} audience share on the night, surpassing the previous record of 30% achieved on the same 14 May 2009 show. The Griffin edition squeezed the audience of Newsnight (BBC Two) to 300,000 viewers compared to its normal 700,000 to 1million, while a repeat showing of Piers Morgan's Life Stories on ITV1 attracted 700,000 viewers, a 5% share. The Times noted <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> figures for the show led the BBC's weekly total, ahead of Strictly Come Dancing on Saturday night.|$|E

Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is pressed with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who had put her up for adoption.|$|E
25|$|Non dialogical (unidirectional. For example, presenters on TV are {{not able}} to adapt their {{discourse}} to the reactions of the audience, since they are visible to a wide audience but <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> is not directly visible to them.

25|$|Due to the unpopularity of the American-led {{invasion}} of Iraq among Greeks, {{it had been}} expected by the media <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> members would protest against the war during {{the entrance of the}} American delegation into the stadium by booing; however, the Americans did receive a warm welcome, much to the pleasant surprise of US news anchors covering the event as well as NBC Sports anchor Bob Costas.|$|E
25|$|The {{stage is}} mostly bare, {{or with a}} few drama-related items. One item, called a Kalivilakku (kali meaning dance; vilakku meaning lamp), {{can be traced back}} to Kuttiyattam. In both traditions, the {{performance}} happens in the front of a huge Kalivilakku with its thick wick sunk in coconut oil, burning with a yellow light. Traditionally, before the advent of electricity, this special large lamp provided light during the night. As the play progressed, the actor-dancers would gather around this lamp so <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> could see what they are expressing.|$|E
25|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} {{constructed}} the language, {{and what it was}} based on. Gary Kurtz stated that the Skeksis language was conceived by author Alan Garner, who based it on Ancient Egyptian, while Odell stated it was he who created it, and that it was formed from Indo-European roots. This idea was dropped after test screening audiences found the captions too distracting, but the original effect can be observed in selected scenes on the various DVD releases. The language of the Podlings was based on Serbo-Croatian, with Kurtz noting <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> members fluent in Polish, Russian and other Slavic languages could understand individual words, but not whole sentences.|$|E

25|$|Prophetic gestures, {{also known}} as sign-acts or {{symbolic}} actions, {{was a form of}} communication in which a message was delivered by performing symbolic actions. Not unique to the book of Jeremiah, these were often bizarre and violated the cultural norms of the time (e.g. Ezekiel 4:4–8). They served the purposes of both drawing audience and causing <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> to ask questions, giving a prophet the opportunity to explain the meaning of the behavior. The recorder of the events in the written text (i.e. the author of the text) had neither the same audience nor, potentially, the same intent that Jeremiah had in performing these prophetic gestures.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s Mayer's output {{increased}} and in 1975 her first major collection appeared in Treble Poets 2. She {{continued to have}} poems published in magazines and anthologies and appeared regularly at poetry readings, on one occasion speaking at the Aldeburgh Festival. Further collections were published including two for children, with many poems written specifically for <b>that</b> <b>audience,</b> and 2013 saw a selection of her poems translated into Norwegian. In 2005 her Prague Winter was published, a short account in prose and poetry of the events leading to Mayer's departure from Prague, and the people she left behind. On BBC radio she has featured in episodes of Poetry Now (1987) and Time For Verse (1990), when Carol Ann Duffy presented poems written and read by Mayer.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their best not to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E
500|$|An {{extended}} version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews. The Hollywood Reporter said <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> expectations were coloured by [...] "the [...] establishment skepticism that preceded Titanic" [...] and suggested the showing reflected {{the desire for}} original storytelling.

5000|$|Content-first marketing's {{primary goal}} is to engage with audiences around {{specific}} behaviors. These behaviors are then linked to specific businesses, products, services or brands [...] "outside" [...] {{the experience of the}} narrative. The key is that the content, the [...] "programming" [...] <b>that</b> the <b>audience</b> experiences and enjoys, does not directly or indirectly sell to them. The philosophy of content-first marketing is <b>that</b> <b>audiences</b> naturally gravitate to content that interests them. They form intellectual and emotional bonds with the content and seek it out. This interest is associated with specific behaviors <b>that</b> the <b>audience</b> either actively engages in or aspires to engage in.|$|R

500|$|His {{first big}} break, however, came {{with his second}} Broadway part in The Royal Hunt of the Sun, a play by Peter Shaffer about the {{destruction}} of the Inca empire by conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He said of this performance, [...] "Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> and had his mind blown." [...] For that part, Carradine won a Theatre World Award for Best Debut Performance in 1965.|$|E
500|$|After {{rehearsal}}s began, Steinbeck {{wrote to}} Hammerstein {{to express his}} delight at the adaptation. He became more dismayed as the play was slowly revised in rehearsal and during the tryouts. According to Traubel, the play was being [...] "cleaned up... as scene after scene became emasculated". The revisions made Suzy's profession less clear, and also fudged the nature of Fauna's house. One revision removed Suzy's police record for [...] "vagrancy". These changes were sparked by the fact <b>that</b> <b>audience</b> members at the tryouts in New Haven and Boston were uncomfortable with the setting and Suzy's role; {{by the time the}} revisions were completed, the script could be read to say that Suzy was merely boarding at Fauna's.|$|E
500|$|In mid-July 2006, New Line Cinema {{revealed}} {{that it would}} not be showing any advance screenings for critics. After the film opened, the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 68% based reviews from 171 critics, with the consensus: [...] "Snakes on a Plane lives up to its title, featuring snakes on a plane. It isn't perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be." [...] At the website Metacritic, which uses a normalized rating system, the film earned a mixed rating of 58% based on 31reviews by mainstream critics.
