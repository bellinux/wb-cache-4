50|$|The term {{cabbage worm}} is {{primarily}} used {{for any of}} four kinds of lepidopteran whose larvae feed on cabbages and other cole crops. Host plants include broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, radishes, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas</b> and kohlrabi. This small group of similar pest species is known to agriculturists as the cabbage worm compte butterflies (family Pieridae, type genus Pieris, garden whites).|$|R
500|$|The farm gardens grew {{a variety}} of crops, {{adapting}} to the market; in 1900 this included oats, rye, corn, wheat, buckwheat, carrots, mangolds, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> radishes, sugar beets, potatoes, apples, cabbages, rye, oat, and wheat straw, hay, corn stalks and silage. The farm rotated its grain production to grow better vegetables. At one time the farm had [...] of asparagus, which sold for 35 to 50 cents per bunch.|$|R
5000|$|Canola was {{developed}} through conventional plant breeding from rapeseed, an oilseed plant already used in ancient civilization as a fuel. The word [...] "rape" [...] in rapeseed {{comes from the}} Latin word rapum meaning turnip. <b>Turnip,</b> <b>rutabaga,</b> cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mustard, and many other vegetables {{are related to the}} two natural canola varieties commonly grown, which are cultivars of B. napus and B. rapa. The change in name serves to distinguish it from natural rapeseed oil, which has much higher erucic acid content.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, some farmers {{cultivated}} the first vegetable gardens, but growing vegetables {{did not become}} common until the early 19th century, when the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the merchant ships staying away. Resident Danes, who brought the tradition of vegetable gardens with them, were usually the first to start growing vegetables. Popular early garden vegetables included hardy varieties of cabbage, <b>turnip,</b> <b>rutabaga,</b> and potato. They were generally prepared in Iceland as boiled accompaniments to meats and fish, and sometimes mashed with butter.|$|E
50|$|These species overwinters as an adult, {{emerging}} in late spring. There is one generation {{in the northern}} part of their range and two in the south. The adults and nymphs are consumers of a wide range of cruciferous plants(Brassicaceae), feeding mainly on the flowering parts. Among cultivated crops the bugs damage cabbage, radish, <b>turnip,</b> <b>rutabaga,</b> horseradish and rape. They can also develop on many species of wild cruciferous plants and on nasturtiums. Natural enemies include a number of species of parasitoid wasps in the family Scelionidae, some species of predatory bugs in the family Nabidae, a rare parasitic fly Clytiomya continua, some spiders and ants. They can be controlled by crop rotation, the destruction of cruciferous weeds and the use of insecticides.|$|E

On pronotum {{they have}} granulate sculpture and unique pattern of 7 longitudinal grooves. Ventral surface is with fine microsculpture, pubescent. Larvae are with long 3 segmented urogomphi and simple (non lobate) 8th tergum. They have four-segmented legs and a 10 segmented abdomen (with the 10th segment being a bit reduced). Helophorus larvae may damage wheat, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> and rapeseed.|$|R
50|$|Turnip {{lanterns}} are an old tradition; since inaugural Halloween festivals in Ireland and Scotland, <b>turnips</b> (<b>rutabaga)</b> {{have been}} carved out {{and used as}} candle lanterns. At Samhain, candle lanterns carved from turnips — samhnag — {{were part of the}} traditional Celtic festival. Large turnips were hollowed out, carved with faces, and placed in windows, used to ward off harmful spirits. At Halloween in Scotland in 1895, masqueraders in disguise carried lanterns made out of scooped-out turnips.|$|R
25|$|There are {{typically}} {{two types of}} vegetables in okroshka. The first must have a neutral taste, such as boiled potatoes, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> carrots, or fresh cucumbers. The second must be spicy, consisting of mainly green onion {{as well as other}} herbs—greens of dill, parsley, chervil, celery, or tarragon. Different meat and poultry can be used in the same soup. The most common ingredient is beef alone or with poultry. If it is made with fish, the best choice would be tench, European perch, pike-perch, cod, or other neutral-tasting fish.|$|R

40|$|NY ranks {{number one}} in the country in {{production}} of fresh cabbage, and number two in processing cabbage. Valued at over $ 62 million per year, cabbage and other crucifers (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, radishes, kale, collards, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> <b>turnip</b> and mustard greens, Chinese cabbage, and several other specialty vegetables) rank second in economic importance among New York vegetables, just after potatoes. Because cabbage represents the great majority (84 %) of acres of crucifers in NY, the information in this Crop Profile pertains to this crop, except where explicitly noted. Crucifers are attacked by a wide variety of pests, and pest management is complex and costly for these extremely important vegetable crops. While producers use a variety of insecticides of varying classes, organophosphates, including chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, endosulfan, and oxydemeton-methyl, play a very important role in cabbage insect management. Organophosphates and carbamates are the only effective materials currently available for control of cabbage maggots. Their use in rotation with other classes of insecticides greatly aids in resistance management and control of diamondback moth and onion thrips, two of the most difficult insect pests to manage in cabbage. Aphid control without organophosphates could be significantly more problematic and expensive. Without the registration o...|$|R
40|$|To {{throw some}} light on the subject of succulence for winter {{fattening}} of lambs, with especial reference to the use of corn silage in that capacity, a series of experiments was conducted during three winters, beginning December, 1906. These experiments were planned to indicate the principal results attending the feeding of succulent feed to fattening lambs and to furnish a comparison between the old time special crops for this purpose, and corn silage, the only succulent feed practicable for winter use on an extensive scale. The immediate objects of the work were as follows: 1. To compare a ration of grain and hay for fattening lambs with rations containing succulent feed. 2. To compare sugar beets, mangels, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> cabbage, and corn silage as sources of succulence for fattening lambs. 3.

50|$|Circa 1940 {{electricity}} was reestablished at the farm. It {{was used}} until the utility company power {{was brought to}} the farm in the 1940s after the war. During 1943, 1944, and 1945, Henry and Arthur Studebaker grew vegetables at the farm for sale to local residents. They had a 2 acre garden in the eastern portion of the field south of the orchard and north of the current visitor center parking lot. They grew vegetables to sell door to door in Dune Acres. They grew asparagus, lima beans, yellow and green snap beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery (white), kale, leaf lettuce, endive, cantaloupe, watermelons, okra, green onions, leeks, parsnips, peas, green and red peppers, red, white, and sweet potatoes, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, red rhubarb chard and white Swiss chard, Jerusalem and butternut squash, red and yellow tomatoes, <b>turnips,</b> <b>rutabagas,</b> kohl robi, cicely, sweet corn (yellow bantam and country gentleman), horseradish, dill, sage, chives, and parsley.|$|R

40|$|This {{station has}} experimented {{during the past}} season with several root crops, among which were the Long Red Mangel, Medium Red, Golden Tankard, Yellow Swedish <b>Turnip,</b> <b>Rutabagas,</b> and Carrots. These were planted on one acre of August plowed meadow sod ground, disced twice November 1 st in order to kill insects. In the spring it was plowed twelve inches deep and {{thoroughly}} pulverized by the disc and harrow. The seed was planted {{in the last days}} of May and first day of June, in small ridges, two feet apart, with a Planet Jr. seeder. Cultivation the first time was done with a hand cultivator. The few weeds in the rows were pulled by hand. After that, cultivation was done four times with a one horse Planet Jr. cultivator; at the last cultivation the earth was turned toward the rows. At this, time the ground between the rows was entirely shaded with the tops. The few remaining weeds, after the last cultivation, were removed with hand and hoe; comparatively little hand work was done. A good stand was obtained of all roots, except the carrots, which are most difficult to start, being slow of growth when young, and requiring more hand work than most roots...|$|R
25|$|The term {{root crops}} refers to any edible {{underground}} plant structure, but many root crops are actually stems, such as potato tubers.

50|$|The {{tuberous}} crop {{known as}} the potato originated in the southern region of Peru. The potato served as the principal staple crop for the Inca Empire and was met with similar popularity in the Spanish Empire. Spanish armies and workers adopted the crop as a staple because of the relative ease associated with its production. Peasants also adopted the crop as the 16th century progressed. The potato continued to spread rapidly throughout Europe where, by the 19th century, it had replaced the <b>turnip</b> and <b>rutabaga</b> as the principal food staples.|$|R

5000|$|The {{two years}} prior to the {{revolution}} (1788-89) saw meager harvests and harsh winters, possibly because of a strong El Niño cycle [...] caused by the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland. The Little Ice Age also affected farmers' choices of crops to plant; in other parts of Europe, peasant farmers had adopted the potato as its staple crop. The potato had been introduced to France during the 16th century and despite resistance had largely supplanted the <b>turnip</b> and <b>rutabaga</b> in France. Despite encouragement from individuals like Antoine Parmentier and Louis XVI, grain was still a much more popular staple crop in France. This was partially because potatoes were seen as more difficult to transport and store than grain.|$|R
