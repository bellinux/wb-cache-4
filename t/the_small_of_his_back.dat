5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and the wound was not serious.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the name}} is called, the tautu'ava walks towards the person indicated, keeping his left hand with the palm {{outwards}} firmly lodged in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Immediately he hears the 'ava title called and {{is aware of the}} status of the individual named, the tautua'ava, if the chief to be served is the holder of an important chief title, raises the cup above his head and advances towards the chief.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no {{antidote}} currently available for ricin poisoning, vaccination is possible by injecting an inactive form of protein chain A. This vaccination is effective for several months due to the body's production of antibodies to the foreign protein. In 1978 Bulgarian defector Vladimir Kostov survived a ricin attack {{similar to the one}} on Georgi Markov, probably due to his body's production of antibodies. When a ricin-laced pellet was removed from <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> it was found that some of the original wax coating was still attached. For this reason only small amounts of ricin had leaked out of the pellet, producing some symptoms but allowing his body to develop immunity to further poisoning.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest of}} four {{children}} (one of whom died in infancy), Blair grew up in Pittsburgh's Hill District. Although he was <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> siblings at birth, he was the largest child in his class {{by the time he}} started at Manchester Academic Charter School, where he attended kindergarten through eighth grade. Both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parents played basketball at Schenley High School, which was located in North Oakland/Schenley Heights until 2008, and his uncle ran the nearby Ammons Recreation Center, where he learned to play the game.|$|R
50|$|Clegg, a Kingsville recruit, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> players <b>of</b> <b>his</b> era. He {{spent three}} seasons at Footscray before ending up at Yarraville where {{he won the}} J. J. Liston Trophy in 1963.|$|R

25|$|The exaggerated walk, {{with one}} hand on <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and his torso bent almost 90 degrees at the waist was a parody of a fad from the 1880s and 1890s. Fashionable young men of the upper classes would affect a walk with their right hand held fast to the base of their spines, and with a slight lean forward at the waist and a very slight twist toward the right with the left shoulder, {{allowing}} the left hand to swing free with the gait. (Edmund Morris, in his biography The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, describes a young Roosevelt, newly elected to the State Assembly, walking into the House Chamber {{for the first time in}} this trendy, affected gait, somewhat to the amusement of the older and more rural members.) Groucho exaggerated this fad to a marked degree, and the comedy effect was enhanced by how out of date the fashion was by the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Percy Jackson {{learns that}} Kronos' forces are {{preparing}} to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides {{that it is time}} for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (<b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back).</b> Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's next Great Prophecy.|$|E

5000|$|Ascapart (also spelled Ascupart, Ascapard, Ascopard, [...] "Ascopart" [...] and Asgapard) was {{a legendary}} giant from English folklore, {{supposedly}} conquered by Bevis of Hampton, though so huge as to carry Bevis, his wife, and horse under his arm. He was 30 feet tall but <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> land, and was defeated after his club (made from a whole tree) was swung at Sir Bevis and became stuck in soft ground. Rather than slaying the giant however, Sir Bevis {{decided to make}} him his Squire. Later Ascapart betrayed Bevis and took his wife Josiane, who was imprisoned with Ascapart as her jailer. For this Ascapart was killed by Bevis' friends when they freed Josiane.|$|R

500|$|Wanda {{returns home}} and the men cross Persia and Afghanistan, driving through Herat to Kandahar and Kabul. They had driven 5,000 miles (8,000 km) in a month. There are comic touches, as when [...] "The {{proprietor}} Abdul, a broken-toothed demon of a man, conceived a violent passion for Hugh. We sat with him drinking coffee... 'Arrrh, CAHARLESS, soul of your father. You have ill-used your motor-car.' He hit Hugh a violent blow of affection in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> {{just as he was}} drinking his coffee. 'Urggh!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Workman {{fired at}} Schultz twice. One bullet struck him {{slightly}} below his heart, and ricocheted through his abdomen before exiting <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Schultz collapsed onto the floor, and Workman joined Weiss {{in the back}} room of the restaurant. Both men then fired several times at Schultz's gang members: Otto Berman, Schultz's accountant; Abe Landau, Schultz's chief henchman; and Schultz's bodyguard, Bernard [...] "Lulu" [...] Rosencrantz. Berman collapsed immediately after being shot. Landau's carotid artery was severed by a bullet passing through his neck, while Rosencrantz was hit repeatedly at point blank range with 00 lead buckshot. Nevertheless, both men rose to their feet and returned fire, driving the assassins out of the restaurant. Weiss jumped into the getaway car and ordered the driver to abandon Workman. Landau chased Workman out of the bar and emptied his pistol at him, though he missed. Workman fled on foot, and Landau finally collapsed onto a nearby trash can.|$|E

5|$|Subtitled Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung ("Fantasy in {{the form}} of a quadrille on {{favourite}} themes from Der Ring des Nibelungen"). Fauré admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> details <b>of</b> <b>his</b> scores, but he was one of the few composers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.|$|R
50|$|Davis was {{regarded}} {{by many as}} one of the finest athletes ever from the state of Georgia, but due to <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> school, his chances for exposure were relatively low.

60|$|Gamaliel did {{straighten}} up, {{as though}} Miss Lucretia had applied {{a lump of}} ice to <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> So it is when the literary deities, vestal or otherwise, return to their Stratfords.

60|$|Frank soothed {{the wounded}} {{feelings}} of the old clerk, and explained that by stuffy he meant interesting.

6000|$|... "My father {{world have}} thought I {{was a fool}} to go off serenading," [...] he answered, flushing.

25|$|Although he {{had lost}} his {{stereoscopic}} vision, he could still see fine print and the hairs on <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> <b>small</b> insects. <b>His</b> reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on insects.|$|R
50|$|Collins's {{search for}} {{background}} information for Armadale {{took him to}} the Norfolk Broads and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> village <b>of</b> Winterton-on-Sea. <b>His</b> novel The Moonstone was serialised in All the Year Round from January to August 1868.

25|$|Joye {{is one of}} the composers {{mentioned}} in Guillaume Crétin's famous poem Déploration sur le trépas de Jean Ockeghem written on the death of Johannes Ockeghem in 1497; in it he {{is one of the}} angels welcoming Ockeghem into Heaven. The composers mentioned by Crétin have long been used as a list of those considered most famous in the late 15th century, thus indicating Joye's reputation, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works which have survived.|$|R
60|$|Thirlwell saw it {{was time}} to interfere. An Indian never forgets an injury, and Drummond had {{inherited}} his father's grim Scottish stubbornness.

He was {{particularly}} violent, and paid no attention whatever to Bradley.|$|E
50|$|De Courcy's force {{advanced}} on Downpatrick, {{the chief}} {{seat of the}} Dál Fiatach dynasty who then ruled Ulaid.

The papal legate, Cardinal Vivian, {{had been on a}} visit to Ulster when this attack happened and he called for the withdrawal of de Courcy's forces, however this went unheeded.|$|R
30|$|Our patient showed {{improvement}} on conservative management only. The authors feel that is {{primarily due to}} <b>the</b> <b>small</b> size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lesion and because his initial Glasgow Coma score was not very low. The authors further speculate that the patient’s excellent response to conservative treatment might also be due to his young age. A {{number of studies have}} already highlighted the positive correlation that exists between younger age group patients and their increased recovery rates following traumatic brain injuries [12, 13].|$|R
