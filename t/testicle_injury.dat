Foram realizadas oito coletas de sêmen de sete reprodutores soropositivos para o LVC: quatro antes dos animais sofrerem dano testicular e quatro depois. Entre as coletas realizadas na mesma semana, em uma, o ejaculado era lavado, para retirada do plasma seminal, e na outra, não. O DNA pró-viral do LVC foi identificado pela reação em cadeia da polimerase Nested (PCR Nested), e pelo isolamento viral. O vírus foi isolado em 7, 1 % das amostras. A PCR identificou o DNA pró-viral em 35, 7 % do total das amostras: 17, 9 % nas amostras lavadas e 53, 6 % das amostras de sêmen integrais. O dano ao testículo permite maior fluxo do vírus para o sêmen, pois antes do dano, 21, 4 % das amostras foram positivas e pós-dano, 50 %. A transmissão do LVC pelo sêmen de reprodutores caprinos é potencializada pela presença de inflamações testiculares e pelo fato de o sêmen criopreservado conter o LVC na forma infectante.

Abstract: The {{objective of this}} work was to evaluate {{the presence of the}} DNA provirus of the caprine lentivirus (LVC) in ejaculates of naturally infected males, and to verify the influence of the wash of the semen as well as the presence of testicle inflammation on the viral load. Eight semen collections of seven soropositive reproducers were accomplished, four before <b>testicle</b> <b>injury</b> and four after injury. Amongst the collections carried out at the same week, in one the ejaculate was washed, to withdraw the plasma seminal, and in the other it was not. The provirus DNA was identified both by Nested polymerase chain reaction technique (Nested PCR) and by the viral isolation. The virus was isolated in 7. 1 % of the samples. The PCR identified the provirus DNA in 35. 7 % of all samples, 17. 9 % in the washed samples and 53. 6 % of the integral semen samples. The injury of the testicle tends to greater flow of virus for the semen, therefore, before injury, 21. 4 % of the samples were positive and after-injury, 50 %.

40|$|We {{present an}} unusual {{case of a}} single gunshot to the {{genitalia}} in which the bullet trajectory injured the urethra, corpus cavernosum, and both <b>testicles.</b> All <b>injuries</b> were successfully repaired during initial exploration. Our report serves as a reminder to clinicians {{to have a high}} index of suspicion in this circumstance and consider immediate exploration of all the injured areas. We also demonstrate the use of a dartos fascia interposition flap to cover and separate the concomitant urethral and corporal sutures lines. Our dartos flap bolstered the urethral and cavernosal repairs and helped prevent postoperative corporourethral fistula formation...|$|R

5000|$|Hank {{eventually}} {{passes out}} from the pain, awaking to find Bill standing over him. The paramedics inform Peggy that Hank's groin area is severely swollen from Bobby's kick and, due to that, cannot [...] "find" [...] one of his <b>testicles.</b> With the <b>injury</b> he has suffered, Hank can neither walk straight nor sleep on his stomach, and is largely confined to a chair. He punishes Bobby for his actions, saying that he cannot watch television or play [...] "vidya games" [...] until further notice.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 August 2011, {{the last}} day of the {{transfer}} window, Blackburn Rovers signed Dann on a four-year deal for an officially undisclosed fee, reported by BBC Sport as £6m. Dann said that manager Steve Kean, with whom he had worked at Coventry, was [...] "a big factor" [...] in his decision to join the Ewood Park club. He was given squad number 16. On 11 September, he made his debut in a 1-1 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage, starting alongside Christopher Samba and completing the full 90 minutes as Rovers earned their first point of the season. During the 2-1 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion in December, Dann scored his first goal for Rovers, but also suffered a ruptured <b>testicle,</b> an <b>injury</b> which was expected to keep him out for six weeks. At the end of the 2011-12 season, Dann made a total of 28 appearances in all competitions and also suffered relegation for the third time in his career as Rovers finished in 19th place in the Premier League.|$|R
