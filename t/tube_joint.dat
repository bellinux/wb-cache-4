These included loss of smell, loss of taste, skin irritation, a burning sensation of the mucus membranes, and redness and chapping of the lips. These conditions extended to home during the weekends and throughout holiday breaks as well. Concerns about air contaminants were raised {{with regard to the}} operation of the. 50 -cal. two-stage light gas gun (2 SLGG).

40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in assembling tubes or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic <b>tube</b> <b>joint.</b> First is the state of residual stress that exists after the crimped joint is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This interference gives a backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical curative effect of double loop insertion of silicone rubber tube combined with "Z" flap repair {{in the treatment}} of laceration of eyelid with canaliculus laceration. METHODS: The paper reviewed 45 cases of laceration of eyelid with laceration canaliculus, caused by trauma, which were treated in my hospital from January 2014 to January 2016. In the process of anastomosis of lacrimal duct and suture of eyelid laceration, either the method of single spinal anesthesia tube placement on skin contraposition suture or the method of dual annular silicone tube placement combined with the word "Z" flap repair was used. We compared the two methods and studied the possible complications like eyelid varus and valgus, lacrimal point valgus, eyelid scar, anastomotic dehiscence again. RESULTS: Out of the 22 cases in which the patients chose the single spinal anesthesia tube implantation on skin suture, 21 cases succeeded and patients received lacrimal duct patency results after extubation; and 1 case anastomosis failed. Complications: 20 cases had different degree of complications and the impact on their appearances were significant. Out of the 23 cases in which the patients chose double passage annular silicone <b>tube</b> <b>joint</b> prosthesis implantation Z flap, 23 received extubation results lacrimal patency or almost patency, the anastomosis of patients was successful. Complications: in two cases, patients had mild eyelid entropion and pomatum varus. Both eyelid deformity and severe wound tear did not occur in all cases again. Scar was not obvious. The success rate of anastomosis between the two groups was not significantly different(P = 0. 4889). To compare the rate of complications, there were significant differences(χ 2 = 30. 42, P CONCLUSION: The application of dual ring implantation silicon tube combined with the word "Z" flap repair {{in the treatment of}} lacrimal canaliculi laceration of eyelid laceration ensured the success rate of lacrimal canalicular anastomosis, greatly improved the eye appearances, and reduced the incidence of postoperative complications...|$|E

The tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> is an important element for the switch condenser. The welding residual stress in the tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> {{is critical to the}} safety and reliability of the switch condenser. In this paper, FEM was used to predict the welding residual stress in the elliptical tube to tube sheet weld of a phthalic anhydride switch condenser. In order to validate the simulated results, a test sample with circular-shaped tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> was prepared. And then the welding residual stresses in the circular tube to tube sheet weld were simulated by the FEM and studied experimentally by the X-ray diffraction method. The simulated results were compared with the test results to verify the finite element analysis. The simulated results show that the residual stress initially decreased sharply and then decreased gradually with the increase of the distance along the direction of the long axis of the elliptical weld. It is found that the maximum welding residual stress in the elliptical tube to <b>tube</b> sheet <b>joint</b> appeared at the location of 180 ° in the region of the elliptical weld and reached its peak value. Experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results...|$|R

Although there have been great efforts made in elucidating its pathogenic mechanisms, Henoch-Schönlein purpura etiology remains unknown: the basic scene comes across an abnormal inflammatory process deriving from immune reactions to various antigenic stimuli, which might be bacterial, viral, or parasitic agents, in a genetically prone individual. Then, a peculiar immune complex deposition in the vascular walls and overproduction of different proinflammatory molecules elicit different clinical signs, which might be differentiated according to either a specific trigger or a specific genetic make-up.

Works carried out on weldability studies and high temperature properties of Super 304 H weld joints reported the tendency of Super 304 H to hot cracking and use of matching Super 304 H filler metal as an alternate to Ni-based filler metal (Vekeman et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014). However, the available information on solidification behaviour of gas tungsten arc (GTA) welds of Super 304 H {{and its effects on}} high temperature properties are very scant.

The amount of alloy segregation, composition of segregated elements in autogenous joints, and the role of alloying elements added in the filler metal to avoid detrimental segregation along with their effects on tensile strength of the joints are discussed in this paper.|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} applications require sheet to sheet or sheet to <b>tube</b> <b>joints.</b> The electromagnetic pulse technology is capable to produce {{these kinds of}} joints. In literature many examples of sheet to sheet solid state welding between similar and dissimilar metals are presented and analyzed in detail. However, {{the most of the}} presented welding applications, which are very focussed on the academic level, are simple specimens for example for tensile test. These specimens are usually very small in their dimensions and therewith capable to be welded with the help of stationary EMPT coils. In contrast to this approach the majority of typical {{industrial applications}} demand the ability of manufacturing several welds in different positions on the same assembly application comparable to the spot welding process of an automotive car body. Here several spot welds are realised in a variety of positions by a robot mounted spot welding gun. The use of a stationary coil is no option here. A first step in manufacturing complex assemblies by EMPT was done by PSTproducts by welding a car- shaped space frame. Within this project substantial knowledge has been generated with respect to non stationary EMPT coils and the flexibility of the cables connecting the coil with the pulse generator.
