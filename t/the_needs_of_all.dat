25|$|In some service industries, {{especially}} health care, {{dispute resolution}} and social services, a popular concept {{is the idea}} of the caseload, which refers to the total number of patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsible.

25|$|It is not {{realistic}} for the Court {{to assume that}} there are unlimited funds to address <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> A judicial approach on this basis would tend to make a government reluctant to create any new social benefit schemes because their limits would depend on an accurate prediction {{of the outcome of}} court proceedings under s. 15(1) of the Charter.|$|E

25|$|Multiple reasons {{account for}} the super {{conferences}} realignment. First, the plan was triggered by dissatisfaction with competitive balance between schools, particularly in the football programs in public and non-public schools {{in the northern part}} of the state. It would allow schools more flexibility with whom they schedule for such events. Second, new enrollment totals and rates have vastly changed since the conferences were set up 27 years ago, and therefore have not adequately met <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the schools. A final catalyst is the economy; the move would create cheaper overall traveling expenses.|$|E
25|$|There were motives {{behind the}} aristocratic {{officials}} and later scholar-officials' classifying of certain {{groups in the}} hierarchy and leaving others out. The scholar-officials placed farmers as the second most prestigious group because the aristocratic officials and scholar-officials were landholders themselves, much like farmers (the ones who weren't tenant farmers or serfs). Both farmers and artisans were placed on a higher tier than merchants because the two former groups produced crops and manufactured goods, essential things needed by the whole of society. The merchants were seen as merely talented at business and trading, and were often seen as greedy and even parasitic to <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other groups.|$|E
25|$|Webster's first bill {{to become}} law was the 1985 Home Education Program Act which legalized homeschooling in Florida. He {{considers}} it his most significant legislation. He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate, {{and a member}} of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the Institute in Basic Life Principles. While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> school districts and not raise any new taxes. He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes. He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who would be homeschooling their children.|$|E

25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E
