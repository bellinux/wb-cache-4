The prototype is reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California. Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.|$|E
25|$|Green {{took control}} of the company in 1949 and quickly started {{dismantling}} the railway system, announcing that the company would completely switch to buses by 1958. The system's PCCs were sold to Mexico City (91), Newark NJ (30) and Shaker Heights OH (20). Green sold his shares in 1950 to be briefly replaced by Emil B. Anderson before local lawyer Fred Ossanna ascended to head the company the next year. Ossanna held off on the <b>teardown</b> for a short while, but soon announced that the process would be accelerated. Lines would be removed and replaced by buses in two years.|$|E
25|$|The Switch is {{produced}} between Taiwan-based Foxconn and Japan-based Hosiden, with Foxconn {{accounting for the}} largest volume. Nintendo did not plan to sell the unit below manufacturing cost, as they had done for both the 3DS and Wii U at their respective launches; Nintendo affirmed that the Switch would be profitable from launch during its 2016 fiscal year earnings report, as the company saw the console as a key earnings driver for 2017 and beyond. Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, a Japanese product <b>teardown</b> firm, estimated that the Switch cost $257 to make compared to its $299 MSRP, with the Console and Dock at $167 while each Joy-Con cost $45. Kimishima said {{that they may be}} able to see further profitability on the Switch when they can achieve volume discounts on components once they reach a level of about 10 million Switch units.|$|E

[...] Nick Sylvester from Pitchfork Media found the song corny, classifying it as [...] "Eve- and Dre- and Tevye-powered camp-hop."

[...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly disagreed, stating that the interpolation was used awkwardly, and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called the interpolation a goof. Jason Shawhan from About.com called the track [...] "a dancehall/classic house <b>teardown</b> of 'If I Were a Rich Man'" [...] and added, [...] "If this is what Jay-Z's fudging with Annie has wrought, I say, be glad of it." ...|$|E

Takeda described the Nvidia chipset critical to bring similar performance for games as they have on personal computers, helping to achieve [...] "high performance but low power consumption" [...] for the Switch. Prerelease reports, unconfirmed by either Nintendo or Nvidia, stated that the SoC would be an Nvidia Tegra X1 SoC [...] with 4 ARM Cortex-A57 CPU cores and 4 ARM Cortex-A53 CPU cores along with 256 Maxwell based CUDA GPU cores. This was later corroborated by an analysis on the console done by Tech Insights in March 2017. The CPU cores are clocked at 1.020GHz, as revealed by DigitalFoundry. The GPU cores vary between 768MHz and 307.2MHz depending upon whether the device is docked; however, they can be boosted to 921MHz and 384MHz, [...] respectively.

Products considered by students range from complex systems such as mobile phones to relatively simple systems such as memory sticks and McDonald’s Happy Meal ® toys. Using product <b>teardowns</b> and reverse engineering ideas has proven to be an effective vehicle for educating students on practical manufacturing cost modeling of systems and complements typical engineering economics analysis...|$|R

50|$|This {{information}} can {{be of interest to}} hobbyists, but can also be used commercially by the technical community to find out, for example, what semiconductor components are being utilized in consumer electronic products, such as the Wii video game console or Apple's iPhone. Such knowledge can aid understanding of how the product works, including innovative design features, and can facilitate estimating the bill of materials (BOM). The financial community therefore has an interest in <b>teardowns,</b> as knowing how a company's products are built can help guide a stock valuation. Manufacturers are often not allowed to announce what components are present in a product due to non-disclosure agreements (NDA). <b>Teardowns</b> also play a part in evidence of use in court and litigation proceedings where a companies parts may have been used without their permission, counterfeited, or to show where intellectual property or patents might be infringed by another firms part or system.|$|R
