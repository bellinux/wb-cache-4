40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of comparative research on the roughness and tool life of the machined surface when steel and cast iron work pieces were turned, reamed and tapped and the cutting zone was lubricated by various coolants (mineral oils, oil emulsions) with and without twisted nematic liquid crystals. The tested liquid crystals were taken from the same homologous series (fatty acid cholesterol esters) but had different molecular mass.

40|$|On-line {{sources of}} news {{typically}} follow a particular pattern when presenting updates on a news event over time. First, they produce {{a preliminary report}} on the event, and later send out updates as the story evolves. There are two classes of readers accessing the latter stories - these who have read the original announcement and {{are familiar with the}} story background and those who are " the thread at a later point in time. Because of the existence of the two clases of readers, news sources typically include in consequent stories some information that was already present in earlier stories.

Alongside narratives valorising the struggle for a distinct national identity, the motif of isolation abounds in the historiography of Australian medical research.

Written as an experimental bricolage, the article weaves together two main threads to chart our engagements with feminist research and with writing practices, both of which we envisage as forms of feminist praxis. The red thread explores feminist research as a continuous accomplishment in which becoming-feminist is enacted through our different research narratives.

40|$|The endless <b>thread</b> This <b>article</b> {{discusses}} {{the volume of}} short stories, Boereoorlogstories, which was compiled and edited by Jeanette Ferreira. The stories are all about the Anglo-Boer War (1899 - 1902) and {{though some of the}} stories simply retell history {{from the point of view}} of specific individuals, some of the stories are indeed fine examples of postmodernist fiction. In the best stories in the volume the narrators engage with history in a number of ways: by indicating the fallacies of historiography, by contrasting little narratives with the master narrative of official historical documents, by emphasizing the textuality of history and the necessity of retelling the past. Personalized history and personalized interpretations of historical facts and historical documents are used in attempting to find or create new identities. The use of historiographical metafiction enables these narrators to interact with a present which is so complex and still so near that it can only be approached indirectly through stories...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{initiate}} a systematic study to help distinguish a special group of online users, called hidden paid posters, or termed “Internet water army ” in China, from the legitimate ones. On the Internet, the paid posters represent {{a new type}} of online job opportunity. They get paid for posting comments and new <b>threads</b> or <b>articles</b> on different online communities and websites for some hidden purposes, e. g., to influence the opinion of other people towards certain social events or business markets. Though an interesting strategy in business marketing, paid posters may create a significant negative effect on the online communities, since the information from paid posters is usually not trustworthy. When two competitive companies hire paid posters to post fake news or negative comments about each other, normal online users may feel overwhelmed and find it difficult to put any trust in the information they acquire from the Internet. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the behavioral pattern of online paid posters based on real-world trace data.

40|$|Frances Hodgson Burnett was {{the product}} of two cultures, British and American. An {{interest}} in the relations between these two cultures pervades her work and forms a significant thematic <b>thread.</b> This <b>article</b> investigates the articulation of such tensions in Burnett’s three most famous children’s books. The cultural polarities at issue in Little Lord Fauntleroy ([1886] 1899), the earliest of the three novels under consideration, are closest to the tensions in Burnett’s own life as a British American. In this novel, Burnett manages to reconcile the American egalitarianism of the protagonist’s early childhood values with an almost feudal concept of noblesse oblige, and it is suggested that this conceptualisation remains imperative also in her later works. In A little princess ([1905] 2008) and The secret garden ([1911] 1968), imperial India is set against England as the primary polarity. Burnett’s exposition is shown to conform to Edward Said’s notions of Orientalism, showing India to constitute an almost archetypal image of the Other, yet the novels are critical of imperialism as causing the distortion of the imperialist as would later be defined by Orwell in Shooting an elephant and other essays (1950). It is suggested that in spite of an ostensible classlessness, the novels express a profoundly conservative and hierarchical vision. [URL]...|$|R
