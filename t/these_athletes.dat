La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. The Russian team potentially could be stripped of up to 12 Olympic medals among <b>these</b> <b>athletes</b> alone.|$|E
5|$|Boston born Kenza Tazi was {{the sole}} female athlete {{competing}} for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She had skied {{from the age of}} three onwards, and said her hero was American skier Bode Miller. At the time of the start of the 2014 Games, she was also 17; she celebrated her 18th birthday while in Sochi. She chose to represent Morocco over the United States as the Moroccan Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third skier, Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute. <b>These</b> <b>athletes</b> were also accompanied by four officials.|$|E
5|$|The St. Kitts and Nevis Olympic Committee sent a {{total of}} seven athletes to the Games, six men and one woman, to compete in athletics. Two of <b>these</b> <b>athletes</b> did not compete at these Games. Sprinter Tameka Williams withdrew from the games for admittedly using a banned-drug substance. Meanwhile, veteran {{sprinter}} Kim Collins, who reprised his role of carrying the nation's flag {{for the third time}} at the opening ceremony, was sent home by sporting committee, reportedly for spending the night with his wife at a London hotel.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon {{established}} the Jim Thorpe Foundation and gained {{support from the}} U.S.Congress. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded in making {{the case to the}} IOC. In October1982, the IOC Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement. In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Ferdinand Bie and Wieslander, although both of <b>these</b> <b>athletes</b> had always said they considered Thorpe to be the only champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, the IOC presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals. Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and have never been recovered. Although Thorpe is listed as a gold medalist by the IOC, his results from 1912 have not been restored to the official Olympic records.|$|E

500|$|Qualification for {{the race}} was {{restricted}} to five athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), providing that <b>these</b> <b>athletes</b> qualified through the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) rankings, with the UCI ProTour considered to be superior to the UCI Continental Circuits. The number of qualification places allocated varied among the different UCI tours, which all maintain their own ranking system. Any NOC unable to fill its quota of athletes from the ProTour was permitted to enter athletes {{from one of the}} continental tours, and if that was not feasible, from the [...] "B" [...] World Championship. The number of places allocated to each tour were thus (in descending order): 70 riders from the ProTour, 38 from the Europe tour, 15 from the America tour, nine from the Asia tour, five from the Africa tour, and three from the Oceania tour. Five entrants qualified through the [...] "B" [...] World Championships.|$|E

40|$|Collective {{efficacy}} can {{be defined}} as a group’s shared confidence that they will successfully achieve their goal. We examined which behaviors and events are perceived as sources of collective efficacy beliefs in a volleyball context. In Study 1, volleyball coaches from the highest volleyball leagues (n= 33) in Belgium indicated the most important sources of collective efficacy. This list was then adapted based on literature and on feedback given by an expert focus group, resulting in a 40 -item questionnaire. In Study 2, coaches and players from all levels of volleyball in Belgium (n= 2, 365) rated each of these sources on their predictive value for collective efficacy. The expression of efficacy by the athlete leaders on the field was rated by the coaches as most predictive for players’ positive efficacy beliefs. Therefore, in Study 3, we focused on <b>these</b> <b>athlete</b> leaders. More specifically, we explored the different leadership roles occupied by <b>these</b> <b>athlete</b> leaders, and their most important qualities. Furthermore, we examined the impact of these leaders in affecting the efficacy beliefs of their team mates. In addition, we explored the role of team identification. These findings offer a starting point for the design of a continuous measurement of collective efficacy through observation. status: publishe...|$|R

The jumping and {{throwing}} events are won by the athlete who achieves the greatest distance or height. Regular jumping events include long jump, triple jump, high jump and pole vault, while the most common throwing events are shot put, javelin, discus and hammer. There are also [...] "combined events" [...] or [...] "multi events", such as the pentathlon consisting of five events, heptathlon consisting of seven events, and decathlon consisting of ten events. In <b>these,</b> <b>athletes</b> participate in a combination of track and field events.

500|$|British {{official}} broadcaster Channel 4 {{received some}} criticism for {{its coverage of}} the Paralympics. Users of Twitter complained that its coverage of the opening ceremony contained too many commercial breaks, drawing comparisons to similar complaints faced by NBC during the Olympics' opening ceremony; unlike the BBC, who televised the Olympics in the United Kingdom, both NBC and Channel 4 are supported by advertising. Complaints noted that Channel 4 had shown five ad breaks within the first hour of the ceremony, and that ironically, it had recently broadcast a six-hour long late-night dance music special with no adverts at all. Channel 4 defended the criticism by stating that it had broadcast [...] "significantly fewer" [...] commercials than normal for primetime programming during the ceremony, and that the ad breaks were {{needed in order to}} help the channel invest in broadcasting programming such as the Paralympics. Criticism was also made towards comments made by Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy during the telecast; Snow was criticized for making comments about war-torn countries during the parade of nations, while Guru-Murthy received similar criticism for quipping that [...] "looking at the ages of <b>these</b> <b>athletes,</b> which have been helpfully provided to us, they're really quite old." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2008 Summer Olympics {{marked the}} seventh {{appearance}} of an Olympic women's road race event. [...] Qualification {{for the race}} was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC) for the 16 top-ranked countries in overall Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) standings at 1 June 2008, and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 1724. An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place, which {{was taken from the}} countries ranked 1724 in reversed order, provided that <b>these</b> <b>athletes</b> qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings. Additionally, three places were available at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; Gu Sun-Geun, Hae Ok-Jeong and Thatsani Wichana secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way, but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete. The maximum quota of the event was set at 67 cyclists, and as of 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified in this way. Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists, they only entered two. This left three open positions: two were allotted to South Africa and New Zealand, based on their World Tour rankings, and the third was given to Mauritius by direct invitation. Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race, as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test.|$|E

500|$|Because of a {{favourable}} climate, {{sport is}} played year-round in the Cook Islands. [...] Most sports, including netball, cricket, tennis, boxing, golf, soccer, squash and rugby union, are of European origin. The most developed and popular {{of them is}} netball, a sport in which the Cook Islands has participated on a global stage. The two most important international sport competitions that the Cook Islands participate in are the Commonwealth Games and the South Pacific Games. The Cook Islands was a major force behind {{the creation of the}} South Pacific Mini Games, participation in which has {{played an important role in}} the country's modern sporting history. Since the 1970s, the popularity of netball on the islands grew and the Cook Islands has made an effort to host these events as a way to improve facilities. During the 1970s, the Cook Islands began bidding to host international sporting events. Meanwhile, the popularity of netball grew. [...] The sport's popularity is partly due to the influence of New Zealand, where Cook Island players have competed for New Zealand's national team. One such player was Margharet Matenga, who joined the Silver Ferns in 1979. Another was Anna Noovao, who was the captain of the New Zealand side in 1992. New Zealand encouraged the sport in the Cook Islands during the 1980s by hosting coaching and umpiring clinics. There are a number of athletes from the Cook Islands who reside overseas. This is especially true of netball.
