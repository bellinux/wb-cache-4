The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection.

5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on diatoms, filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the castles proved challenging, {{and they}} rapidly fell into disrepair. The money {{given to the}} castle constables <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} and garrison the castles had not been generous to start with, but the sums provided declined considerably during the 14th century. The constable of Conwy Castle had been provided with Â£190 a year in 1284, but this fell away to Â£40 a year by the 1390s; Harlech's funding fell similarly from Â£100 a year to only Â£20 by 1391. By 1321 a survey reported that Conwy was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers, and in the 1330s, Edward III was advised {{that none of the}} castles were in fit state to host the royal court should he visit the region. A 1343 survey showed that Beaumaris needed extensive work, with several of the towers in a ruinous conditions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{amphibians}} are nocturnal {{and hide}} during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use camouflage {{to avoid being}} detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which {{makes it difficult for}} the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands. A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> escape.
