5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E

5|$|The area {{generally}} has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are grown at once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

5|$|Additionally <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> {{transient}} phenomena, {{events which}} do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.|$|E

25|$|In principle, a law becomes binding {{from the}} time of its promulgation.
