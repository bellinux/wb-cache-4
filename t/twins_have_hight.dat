Practical part is focused on determination of anioxidant acivity, comcentration of polyfenols and flavonoids in tea extracts and detection of animicrobial activity of these extracts against bacterial strains Serratia marcescens and Micrococcus luteus. The results of this theasis show that aqueous extracts of rosehips tea are animicrobialy active.
