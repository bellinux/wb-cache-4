5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> look like small dots. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|Myers made eleven {{hydrogen}} balloons for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for {{a military}} exercise. Ten of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby. The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet in diameter. It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment. It {{was used by the}} Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships. This balloon was tethered to and controlled by a Navy ship. The intelligence gleaned about the enemy and its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1995, three gas {{balloons}} {{participating in}} the race entered Belarusian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B attack helicopter of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two balloons were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.|$|E

2500|$|By injecting {{radiocontrast agent}} through a tiny passage {{extending}} down <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> catheter and into <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> is progressively expanded.

5|$|The game is {{composed}} of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each world is to collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden bonus levels, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist of blocks with balloons in them; popping <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> yields either coins or power-ups. A time attack mode is available for any level the player has completed.|$|E
5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself and sticking them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> Hot Air <b>Balloon</b> through <b>the</b> {{properties}} of its components (e.g. {{the volume of}} <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> providing buoyancy through the air it displaces; and the envelope, basket and its contents providing weight) experiences an interaction between the Buoyancy and Weight. [This puts {{the focus on the}} Principle.] When Weight is greater than Buoyancy <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> falls, when Weight is less <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> rises, and when equal <b>the</b> <b>Balloon</b> floats. To decrease the Weight the burner heats the air which expands and leaves the balloon: to increase the Weight the vent is opened, hot air leaves <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> and cooler/denser air enters from the open base of <b>the</b> <b>Balloon.</b> [This puts <b>the</b> focus on the Process.] By use of the burner and the vent, the pilot can control the altitude of <b>the</b> <b>Balloon.</b>|$|R

3000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> pressure-volume {{relationship}} was determined at atmospheric pressure using a previously reported method with some modifications [12, 13, 16]. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> lumen of <b>the</b> catheter was {{connected with a}} three-way stopcock for volume manipulation of <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> and <b>the</b> other two ways were connected to a 1 -ml gas-tight syringe (LOT JM 00 B 25, Runze fluid control equipment, C.O., Ltd., Nanjing, China) and a pressure transducer. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> was first inflated up to the geometric volume to unfold the balloon’s wall. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> was then deflated by generating a negative pressure of approximately − 10  cmH 2 O, and the stopcock was closed. This procedure standardized the residual volume in <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> and we arbitrarily defined <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> volume in this situation as zero inflating volume [12, 13, 16]. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> was progressively inflated in 0.5 -ml increments. After each volume inflation, balloon pressure was measured after a 3 -min equilibration period.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> most {{commonly}} used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled balloons. Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic is used for <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> include propaganda messages written on the surface in Korean script. These balloons were developed to replace blimps previously used by the South Korean government, which were no longer being produced. After <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> travel far enough across the border, a timer opens the plastic bags carried by <b>the</b> <b>balloons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> can travel up to 200kilometers, and the maximum load for each balloon is 10kilograms.

25|$|North Korea {{has warned}} its {{citizens}} that the goods carried by <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> from South Korea are poisoned, but the North Korean {{people have been}} known to ignore these warnings. Due to their size, <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> are easy to track. North Korea has been accused of intercepting <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> and poisoning their contents to convince its citizens that South Koreans do not have good intentions. Organizations like North Korea Peace responded by substituting food with socks, including a warning and instructions for how to render the poisoned socks harmless. Defector and Korean Peninsula International Peace Organization spokesman Lee Ju-Seong stated in 2012 that one good pair of South Korean socks can be sold for enough corn to feed a child for two months.|$|E
25|$|Lowe {{believed}} that balloons used {{for military purposes}} had to be better constructed than the common balloons used by civilian aeronauts. They also required special handling and care for use on the battlefield. At first <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> of the day were inflated at municipal coke gas supply stations and were towed inflated by ground crews to the field. Lowe recognized {{the need for the}} development of portable hydrogen gas generators, by which <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> could be filled in the field. Lowe had to deal with administrative officers who usually held ranks lower than major and had more interest in accounting than providing for a proper war effort. This caused delays in the funding of materials.|$|E
50|$|A {{ceiling balloon}} is a small, usually red, (fluted) rubber balloon {{commonly}} measuring 76 mm (3 in) across prior to inflation, inflated to ~40 cm diameter. After inflation <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> is taken outside and released. By timing <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> from release until {{it enters the}} cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and solid, so the ceiling height is not when <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> disappears but when the colour begins to fade. <b>The</b> <b>balloon</b> {{can also be used}} to measure the vertical visibility into a layer of fog or blowing snow. In this case <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> will begin to fade as soon as it is released, so the vertical visibility is when <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> disappears. If <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> is visible for a considerable distance into the cloud layer the observer should make note of it as it is of importance to aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A {{handling}} or {{drop line}} is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20-30 meters in length attached to <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> basket {{with a quick}} release connection at one end.

50|$|<b>The</b> ceiling <b>balloon</b> is a reliable, {{safe and}} {{simple way to}} get an {{indication}} of the height of clouds. However, it does suffer from some disadvantages that the observer must be aware of. Rain and wet snow may slow the ascent of <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> giving a falsely high ceiling and high winds and poor visibility may cause <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> to appear to enter the cloud before it actually does. As <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> rises at a rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min) it will take over five minutes for <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> to reach 700 m (2300 ft). Beyond this height the ability to follow <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> even with binoculars, is poor, as even the slightest movement of the eye off <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> will almost certainly ensure that it vanishes.|$|R
50|$|When {{the valve}} is released, air will flow from <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> at higher {{pressure}} to <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> at lower pressure. <b>The</b> lower pressure <b>balloon</b> will expand. Figure 2 (above left) shows a typical initial configuration: <b>the</b> smaller <b>balloon</b> has <b>the</b> higher pressure. So, when the valve is opened, <b>the</b> smaller <b>balloon</b> pushes air into <b>the</b> larger <b>balloon.</b> It becomes smaller, and <b>the</b> larger <b>balloon</b> becomes larger. <b>The</b> air flow ceases when <b>the</b> two <b>balloons</b> have equal pressure, with {{one on the left}} branch of the pressure curve (r<rp) and one on the right branch (r>rp).|$|R

25|$|Röth did {{not enjoy}} any success as a fighter pilot until he decided to {{concentrate}} his effort on observation balloons. He was a poor shot, and took up firing upon balloons because they were a large target. He also loaded his guns to maximize his effectiveness against balloons; his left-hand machine gun would be loaded with 80 percent incendiaries and 20 percent armor-piercing, and the right-hand gun vice versa. His decision meant he took upon himself {{one of the most}} hazardous duties of World War I fighter aviation. Because balloons flew at a known altitude, antiaircraft guns ringing them were extremely accurate. <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> were low enough that an attacker was exposed to small arms fire as well. Protective fighters also lurked in the vicinity. <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> were so well defended because they were {{an important part of the}} artillery fire direction systems of World War I.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{launching}} of balloons has provoked North Korea to threaten activists by warning that it would shell the areas with balloon launches. In October 2014, the North Korean border guards' attempt to shoot down some of <b>the</b> <b>balloons</b> led to a firefight due to North Korean shots landing near a South Korean military base and a residential area. A North Korean spy was arrested in 2011 and {{accused of trying to}} assassinate balloon campaign activist Park Sang-hak. In 2014, a North Korean agent posing as a defector was arrested for reportedly attempting to assassinate Choi Jung-hoon, another activist involved in the balloon drops and the commander of the North Korean People's Liberation Front. Jin-Heon Jung points out that the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years. <b>The</b> <b>balloons</b> may contribute to a decay of the remaining cooperation between the Korean governments; activists have been blamed of eagerly trying to destroy any cooperation between the governments.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the volume}} of <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> is more constrained, so is {{the volume of}} air {{displaced}} by it.

But the weight of the atmospheric gas is reduced as <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> rises, because its density diminishes with increasing altitude. [...] So the force pushing <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> upwards diminishes with altitude and at some particular altitude the upwards force will equal the weight of <b>the</b> balloon: <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> will be stable in a finite equilibrium altitude range for long periods.|$|R
40|$|Introduction:  Our goal is {{to design}} a smart valve control system that {{controls}} the elevation of weather balloons by releasing gas from <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b>   This will prevent <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> from ascending so high that it bursts, allowing <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> {{to stay in the}} air much longer than normal weather balloons. As a balloon rises in altitude, the atmospheric pressure decreases and <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> expands.   Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> reaches an altitude where it bursts, causing each balloon to have a very limited flight time.   This is approximately a mere two hours.   Our control system will allow a balloon to remain in the air much longer by controlling the release of gas from <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b>   This will decrease the pressure within <b>the</b> <b>balloon,</b> causing it to sink downwards, which will in turn prevent <b>the</b> <b>balloon</b> from reaching burst altitude.   The controller will accomplish this task by opening and closing the balloon’s gas valve based on altitude, ascending speed, and pressure within <b>the</b> <b>balloon.</b>   This product targets meteorologists and researchers.   Our project will allow this audience to gather more data in a single launch by providing a way to keep high-altitude <b>balloons</b> in <b>the</b> air much longer.  Advisor: Franco de Flaviis, Ph.

50|$|Balloons {{are often}} {{deliberately}} released, creating a so-called balloon rocket.
