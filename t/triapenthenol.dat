40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} manipulation {{through the use}} of plant growth regulators on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) cv. Grasslands Pitau grown for seed were investigated in this study, using both sward and individual plant trials. A white clover seed crop was established in autumn 1988, certified breeders seed of cv. Grasslands Pitau being sown at 3 kg/ha in 45 cm rows. Three plant growth regulators, chlormequat chloride (1. 5 and 3. 0 kg a. i. /ha), paclobutrazol (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) and <b>triapenthenol</b> (0. 5 and 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) were applied at two growth stages; during reproductive initiation (11 October) or at the appearance of the first visible bud (8 November). A further plant growth regulator, daminozide (2. 0 and 4. 0 kg a. i. /ha) was applied only in November. Chlormequat chloride, daminozide and <b>triapenthenol</b> did not significantly affect node production, inflorescence production or seed yield, although thousand seed weight (TSW) was reduced. Paclobutrazol significantly reduced petiole length and increased the number of nodes/m 2, but did not affect dry matter production. The October application of paclobutrazol at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha significantly increased potential harvestable seed yield by 71 % through increasing the number of inflorescences produced, but the 57 % increase following the November application at the same rate did not differ significantly from the control. Actual seed yield differences (+ 25 and 26 %) were also not significant. In the following season (1989 / 1990), three of the plant growth regulators (chlormequat chloride at 3. 0 kg a. i. /ha, paclobutrazol at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha, <b>triapenthenol</b> at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha) were applied using the same site as for the 1988 / 1989 trial (i. e. a second year crop), but avoiding plots previously sprayed with paclobutrazol to eliminate possible soil residual effects. Applications were either during early reproductive initiation (September), during peak reproductive initiation (October) or when reproductive buds/early flowers were first visible (November). Chlormequat chloride did not affect either vegetative or reproductive growth and development. <b>Triapenthenol</b> initially retarded growth (e. g. by reducing petiole length), but this effect was only transiatory, and was no longer evident 3 weeks after application. Although <b>triapenthenol</b> applied in November increased inflorescence number at peak flowering, seed yield was not increased. <b>Triapenthenol</b> applied in October did not affect inflorescence number at peak flowering, but reduced TSW. Paclobutrazol applied in September, October and November reduced petiole length and leaf size, but only application in November increased both node and stolon production. Application in October and November increased inflorescence numbers at peak flowering and harvest respectively, but seed yield was not increased. Data recorded from plots sprayed with paclobutrazol the previous season (1988 / 1989) provided no evidence of growth retardation through soil residual activity. In an attempt to clarify the effects of paclobutrazol on white clover growth and development, individual plants grown from seeds selected at random from a lot of certified breeders seed were established as spaced plants (80 x 80 cm) in the field in spring of 1990. Paclobutrazol was applied at 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha on 6 November 1990 (when more than 75 % of the plants were initiating reproductive buds at their terminal buds) or 23 November 1990 (when more than 50 % of the plant population had reproductive buds visible on their stolons). Petiole length and leaf size were initially reduced, but beginning two months after application, vigorous regrowth occurred, to the extent that paclobutrazol treated plants became as tall as the control plants. However, retardation effects occurred again at harvest. Total plant dry matter and root:shoot ratios were not affected by paclobutrazol. Chlorophyll content/unit leaf area and leaf thickness increased following paclobutrazol application, but increases were not correlated. Seed yield and yield components did not differ from that of the control plants, mainly because plant to plant variation was very large, irrespective of treatment. To attempt to reduce this source of variation, a further spaced plant trial was established in 1991 / 1992 using plants produced by clonal propagation from three distinct genotypes from within cv. Grasslands Pitau. Paclobutrazol was applied at the same rate and time as in the previous season, and while not affecting the number of nodes developed along stolons or inflorescence initiation at the stolon apices, it did significantly increase stolon production in all three genotypes through increasing secondary, tertiary {{and to a lesser extent}} quaternary branch numbers. However, not all these extra stolons were able to produce inflorescences, and this ability varied significantly with genotype. As a consequence, inflorescence number and potential harvestable seed yield were significandy increased only in one genotype following paclobutrazol application. However, paclobutrazol reduced seed abortion and increased seed weight in all three genotypes. In individual plants, inflorescence growth and development from emergence to the seed ripening stage occurred more quickly in paclobutrazol treated plants than untreated plants. A simulated sward trial was used in 1990 / 1991 to determine whether the previous failures to significantly increase actual seed yield were because paclobutrazol treated plots had ripened earlier than control plots, and as a consequence more seed had been shed by the time of harvest. However, no significant paclobutrazolXharvest time interactions for seed yield or seed yield components were recorded. These results suggest that paclobutrazol did not affect seed maturity in a sward situation. Irrespective of treatment, greatest seed yield came from harvesting 25 days after peak flowering, but this did not differ significantly from harvesting 35 days after peak flowering. Delaying harvest to 40 and 45 days after peak flowering significantly reduced seed yield. As in previous sward trials, paclobutrazol application significantly increased inflorescence numbers, but large (+ 56 %) differences in potential harvestable and actual seed yield were statistically not significant. In each case, high data variation (CV > 30 %) was recorded. Factors responsible for the failure of apparent biological increases to be statistically real are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse-grown {{oilseed rape}} (Brassica napus, annual Canola variety `Westar') plants were {{harvested}} at six {{dates from the}} vegetative phase until the early pod (silique) -fill/late flowering stage. Endogenous gibberellin (GA) -like substances were extracted from stems, purified, and chromatographed on silica gel partition columns prior to bioassay in serial dilution using the `Tan-ginbozu' dwarf rice microdrop assay. The concentrations of total endogenous GA-like substances were low during vegetative stages (1 nanogram GA 3 equivalents/gram dry weight), and rose 300 -fold {{by the time of}} floral initiation. After floral initiation the concentration of GA-like substances fell, then rose again during bolting to maximal levels during the early pod-fill stage (940 nanograms per gram dry weight). The qualitative profiles of GA-like substances varied across harvests, with higher proportions of a GA 1 -like substance at the early pod-fill stage. In a second study stems were similarly harvested at eight dates and the concentrations of endogenous GA 1, the principal bioactive native GA of oilseed rape, were determined by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring using [17, 17 - 2 H]GA 1 as a quantitative internal standard. The concentration of GA 1 increased at about the time of floral initiation and then subsequently fell, thus confirming the pattern noted above for total GA-like substances. The exogenous application of paclobutrazol (PP 333), a persistent triazole plant growth regulator (PGR) which blocks GA biosynthesis, or another triazole, <b>triapenthenol</b> (RSW 0411), prevented flowering as well as bolting; plants remained at the vegetative rosette stage. These results imply a causal role for endogenous GA, in the control of bolting, which normally precedes anthesis. Further, the rise in the concentration of total endogenous GA-like substances, including GA 1, which was associated with floral initiation, and the prevention of visable floral development by the triazole PGRs, also indicates a role for endogenous GAs in the regulation of flowering in B. napus...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{chemical}} manipulation of {{a crop of}} birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) grown for seed in two consecutive years were investigated in this study. In the first year, treatments included Cultar (paclobutrazol) at 0. 5 or 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha, Cycocel (chlormequat chloride) at 1. 5 or 3. 0 kg a. i/ha and Alar (daminozide) at 2. 0 or 4. 0 kg a. i. /ha applied twice at either the late vegetative stage (October) or at the early flowering stage (November). None of these treatments affected seed yield (average 549 kg/ha),or umbel components (pods per umbel, seeds per pod and thousand seed weight). In the second year, at the same stages of plant development, Cultar and Cycocel were applied at the same rates as previously, with an additional treatment added using RSW- 0411 (<b>triapenthenol)</b> at 0. 5 or 1. 0 kg a. i. /ha. Again, no seed yield improvement was obtained by any chemical treatment, but average seed yield being increased 27 % from 769 kg/ha by 6 days delay in harvesting from 41 to 47 DAPF. Shoot length was reduced by chemical applications, especially {{at the time of}} rapid growth, and Cultar had the strongest and longest retarding capability. However, plant branching was not improved by any treatment. Although early flowering pattern was increased by October Cultar application at the higher rate and peak flowering pattern by November Cultar application at either rate, total reproductive structures at harvest in treated plants were similar to those in untreated plants due to flower abortion. Cultar applications in the first year had no carry-over effects on seed production in the second year, but delayed early plant growth in terms of ground cover. Plant growth regulators had no effect {{on the quality of the}} subsequently harvested seeds. Effects of Cultar, Cycocel and RSW- 0411 applied at higher rates in October reproductive abortion were examined in flowers produced during the flowering season in the second year. Chemical treatments increased flower abortion by 20 %, especially in the early flowers. However, there was no effect on abortion of pods in an umbel, on abortion of ovules or seeds in a pod, or on seed weight. Time of flowering also modified flower abortion rate (late flowers having up to 48 % greater flower survival than early flowers), and seed development rate (being slower in early season flowers), had no effect on pod abortion and seed abortion (average 44 % and 70 %, respectively). Flower abortion was first found as early as 10 DAOF. Pod abortion occurred consistently after flower opening, and ovule or seed abortion occurred particularly in the early stages of seed development...|$|E
