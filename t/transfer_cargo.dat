5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to <b>transfer</b> <b>cargo</b> between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
25|$|As Tampa {{began to}} grow in the mid-1800s, roads across central Florida were still just rough trails and rail lines did not yet extend down the Florida peninsula, so the most {{convenient}} means of traveling to and from the area was by sea. By the late 19th century, however, the shallow nature of Tampa Bay made it impossible for large modern vessels with deeper drafts to reach the city of Tampa's downtown wharves on Hillsboro Bay. Most ships would anchor well out from shore and <b>transfer</b> <b>cargo</b> and passengers to and from the city in smaller boats.|$|E
25|$|On {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} International Space Station, Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough {{successfully}} conducted the mission's second spacewalk. The EVA was 6 hours and 45 minutes in duration, and all tasks were accomplished without complications. Two crew equipment carts were relocated {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the final set of solar arrays, the station's robotic arm was lubricated, and the work on the starboard SARJ continued. Inside the station, crewmembers continued to <b>transfer</b> <b>cargo</b> from Leonardo to the station, items to be returned to Earth into the MPLM, and continued the activation of the Water Recovery System.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{terrorist}} attacks on 9/11 and weeks before the first U.S. bomb was dropped over Afghanistan, the Air Force established air bridges to help funnel material and personnel overseas to support multiple operations in conjunction with Enduring Freedom. Air National Guard tanker units received orders by 20 September 2001, to be in their deployed locations before the start of their air bridge operations. Some ANG tanker units also flew humanitarian support missions. By using European bases, the Air Force could <b>transfer</b> <b>cargo</b> from the larger aircraft to smaller planes, refuel aircraft on the ground, exchange flight crews, give crews rest opportunities, and repair broken aircraft.|$|E
500|$|John Dallaway, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} as a commissioner under the 1730 Act, commissioned the engineer Thomas Yeoman {{to make a new}} survey in 1754, and his new plan was published the following year. It was for a navigation from Wallbridge to the Severn, estimated to cost £8,145, which would require 16 locks and four stanks (which were probably half-locks or staunches). In order to placate the millers, water for the operation of the locks would be provided by a reservoir below Wallbridge, which would cover [...] and be filled on Sundays, when the mills were inactive and would not be needing the water. Tolls were set at a more realistic level. While support and finance for the scheme were being gained, John Kemmett, Arthur Wynde, James Pynock and Thomas Bridge devised a scheme which used cranes at each mill weir to <b>transfer</b> <b>cargo,</b> stored in boxes, from a boat on one level to another {{on the other side of}} the weir. An Act was obtained in 1759 which authorized Kemmett and the others to construct the canal without any locks to avoid loss of water to the mills. The Act allowed two years for completion of the scheme, and although some progress had been made by April 1761, Kemmett was given an extension of six years at that time. After about [...] of river had been improved, the works were abandoned as being too costly.|$|E

2500|$|The Second World War, in {{generating}} greatly increased rail traffic through the shipment of men, munitions and supplies around the country, exposed the inefficiency {{of a national}} rail system built on several systems built to different gauges.

50|$|Mahajanga is a seaport, {{the second}} most {{important}} one in Madagascar after Toamasina. The marine terminal accommodates containerships and small (150 gross ton) general cargo freighters. Because of limited water depth at the wharf, only small ships can call at the terminal. Deeper-draft ships anchor off the terminal and <b>transfer</b> <b>cargoes</b> to and from barges, which move it to and from the terminal.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of the}} 19th century, a {{significant}} portion of sea traffic to New Orleans came in not via the river but to Lake Pontchartrain. Thus the railway was important in <b>transferring</b> <b>cargo</b> between ocean-going ships docked at the lake and riverboats. Many passenger sea ships also arrived via the lake, and the railway took passengers the remainder of the way into the city.|$|R

50|$|In dry bulk, {{lightering}} can {{be undertaken}} {{one of two}} ways. If the vessel to be lightered is geared, then it can discharge cargo to smaller, ungeared vessels (typically barges).

A roll-on/roll-off discharge facility, a floating platform, {{can also be used}} to connect the vessels.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, {{hydraulic}} machinery, including cranes, {{appeared in}} the docks. These used a powerful central power supply and could <b>transfer</b> <b>cargoes</b> more quickly.
