Based on {{the transmission line}} modeling (TLM) method and the fast modal transform (FMT) theory, this technique accelerates {{the process of the}} calculation by introducing the concept of the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> instead of the transverse fields considered in the traditional algorithm. Within cylindrically stratified media, the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are represented by the hybrid modal basis functions. Ultimately, the specific form of the modal admittance and the spectral reflection matrix are deduced. Furthermore, the surface electric fields and electric currents of the cylindrically conformal microstrip antenna fed by means of a microstripline are calculated via the iterative process. On this basis, the input impedance of the antenna can also be obtained. And the results gained by utilizing iterative approach are compared with those from the published references to demonstrate the accuracy or efficiency of this method. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{by using the}} {{assumptions}} that wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance of an electric dipole, {{which in turn is}} much smaller than a distance up to the point of observation, new results for radiation of electric dipole were obtained. These results generalize and extend the classical solution, and they indicate that under the above assumptions the classical electric dipole emits both long-range longitudinal electric and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves.</b> For a specific values of the dipole system parameters the longitudinal and transverse electric fields are shown. Total power emitted by electric and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are calculated and compared. It was shown that under the standard assumption of charge separation distance being much smaller than wavelength: a) classical solution correctly describes the <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> waves; b) <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are dominant and longitudinal electric waves are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to fourth degree of frequency; d) according to classical solution most of the power is emitted perpendicular to electric dipole axis; e) our solution reduces to classical solution. In case wavelength is much smaller than charge separation distance: a) the classical solution is not valid and it overestimates the total radiated power; b) longitudinal electric waves are dominant and <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are negligible; c) total radiated power is proportional to second degree of frequency; d) most of the power is emitted in a narrow beam along the dipole axis, thus emission of waves is focused as with lasers. In the region where wavelength is equivalent to charge separation distance: a) power emitted by longitudinal and transverse waves are equal; b) power of the transverse waves has a dip. It would be interesting to observe these results in experiments. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures, 13 citation...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{disruption}} of an incoming external <b>transverse</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> by an inhomogeneous plasma with energetic electron beam is examined. The plasma-beam characteristics are motivated by theory and experiment. Wave-plasma interactions and wave propagation and reflection in and from a plasma medium is studied. Physical sources such as the plate current density are considered. The inhomogeneity of the plasma slab supporting the energetic electron beam is partially built into the supported fields. The wave-plasma-beam interaction is examined over a wide parameter space. Absorption or reflection of electromagnetic waves {{can be achieved by}} changing the plasma number density, collision frequency, beam number density, and the Gaussian nature of the beam and slab thickness. Under appropriate condition in the presence of an energetic electron beam supported by the plasma slab, the externally generated wave incident on and exciting the slab can resonate with the beam. Although insignificant for the parameters studied, this becomes apparent when the operation frequency (both the wave and the beam) approaches the electron plasma frequency.
