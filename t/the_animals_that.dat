5|$|A {{daily show}} in which keepers {{demonstrate}} the natural skills of animals {{to an audience of}} visitors. Keepers use positive reinforcement training with every animal, which means that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> perform in the shows are never forced into doing tricks. Because of this, the animals used in Animal Antics vary between shows.|$|E
5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> come to the hole.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion. It is one of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> draws tourists to the area to observe big game and as such it is of major economic importance to the region. Traditionally blue wildebeest have been hunted for their hides and meat, the skin making good quality leather though the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by the responses of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, {{which then}} germinate and grow on other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists {{working in}} the 19th century, {{including}} Georges Cuvier, Johannes Peter Müller, and Louis Agassiz admired Aristotle's biology and investigated some of his observations. D'Arcy Thompson translated History of Animals, making a classically-educated zoologist's informed attempt to identify <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> Aristotle names, and to interpret and diagram his anatomical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E

5|$|Dio and Martial record some of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt {{involving}} cranes {{and another}} involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, {{at least one}} tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals {{may have been used}} but are not mentioned; ostriches, camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games. Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486, although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, {{there is no mention of}} hippopotami at Titus' games.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of origin, {{climate and}} culture {{ultimately}} created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse {{to cooperate with}} humans to survive; humans were the only providers {{of food and water}} in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.|$|E
5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
60|$|The chief saw by the {{staggering}} of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> it was mortally wounded, {{and that there}} was no need to follow it up, as it could be easily tracked and found in daylight. He therefore turned to attack another <b>animal</b> <b>that</b> was close at hand.|$|R

5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E

25|$|Large {{animals are}} rare on Kilimanjaro {{and are more}} {{frequent}} in the forests and lower parts of the mountain. Elephants and Cape buffaloes are among <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. Bushbucks, chameleons, dik-diks, duikers, mongooses, sunbirds, and warthogs have been reported as well. Zebras and hyenas have sporadically been observed on the Shira plateau.|$|E
25|$|Greenland Sharks are {{currently}} the vertebrate species with the longest known lifespan. An examination of 28 specimens {{in one study}} published in 2016 determined by radiocarbon dating that the oldest of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> they sampled had lived for about 392 ± 120 years (a minimum of 272 years and a maximum of 512 years). The authors further concluded that the species reaches sexual maturity at about 150 years of age.|$|E
25|$|The fauna of Catalonia {{comprises}} {{a minority}} of animals endemic to the region {{and a majority of}} non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>that</b> live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful wild boar, red foxes, as well as roe deer and in the Pyrenees, the Pyrenean chamois. Other large species such as the bear have been recently reintroduced.|$|E
