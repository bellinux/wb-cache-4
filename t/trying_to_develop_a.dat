25|$|Southwick, local {{physician}} George E. Fell, and {{the head}} of the Buffalo ASPCA performed a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, experimenting with animals in water, out of water, electrode types and placement, and conductive material until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be referred called the electric chair.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 2012, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said on Face the Nation that Iran was not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> nuclear weapon, but was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> nuclear capability. [...] He also urged Israel to work {{together}} rather than make a unilateral strike on Iran’s nuclear installations. On 1 August 2012, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while in Israel said that the United States had [...] "options," [...] including military options, to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, should diplomacy fail. [...] In 2012, sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, reported that Iran was pursuing research that could enable it to produce nuclear weapons, but was not attempting to do so. The senior officers {{of all of the}} major American intelligence agencies stated that there was no conclusive evidence that Iran has made any attempt to produce nuclear weapons since 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Airbus {{has joined}} Honeywell and JetBlue {{in an effort}} to reduce {{pollution}} and dependence on oil. They are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> biofuel that could be used by 2030. The companies propose supplying almost one third of the world's aeroplane fuel needs without affecting food resources. Algae is viewed as a possible alternative energy source because it absorbs carbon dioxide during its growth, and because its use will not affect food production. However, algae and other vegetation-based fuels are still just experiments, and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop. [...] Airbus recently operated the first alternative fuel flight on a mixture of 60% kerosene and 40% gas to liquids (GTL) fuel in one engine. It did not cut carbon emissions, but it was free of sulphur emissions. Alternative fuel was able to work properly in Airbus' aeroplane engine, demonstrating that alternative fuels should not require new aeroplane engines. This flight and the company's long term efforts are considered big strides towards environmentally friendly aeroplanes.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Jeph Loeb {{requested}} {{the introduction of}} Superman’s future ally, Metropolis Police Lieutenant Maggie Sawyer, for the episode [...] "Insurgence".

[...] The concept for [...] "Insurgence" [...] also developed from an aspect of the Superman mythology that stemmed back to Superman’s original incarnation, which was his ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. After their Thanksgiving break, the [...] "Smallville" [...] writers were in the writers' room when Miles Millar walked in and exclaimed, [...] "I think it's time for Clark to leap a tall building." [...] Jeph Loeb and the other writers had already been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> story that involved a hostage situation, and after Millar made his announcement the team suggested that they also pay homage to the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard. The setting for the hostage situation was LuthorCorp Plaza; the team introduced the [...] "Daily Planet", another pivotal piece of Superman lore that would one day employ Clark Kent and his alternate identity of Superman, by using it as the building that Clark uses to execute his [...] "first leap". [...] "Insurgence" [...] was actually written before [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect", but not filmed until after both of those episodes because the team was having difficulty figuring out the logistics of producing the episode.
