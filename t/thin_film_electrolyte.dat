40|$|Abstract. Fabricating {{electrolyte}} {{with thin}} film {{is one of}} various methods of lowering the operation temperature for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Because the major polarization of SOFCs is ohmic loss, many groups have tried to fabricate a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolyte</b> – some proton conducting material that has the conductivity {{of a couple of}} orders higher than oxygen conducting one. We have investigated the synthesis of Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) including Yttria-doped Barium Zirconate(BYZ) <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolyte</b> via thin-film processes such as Pulsed Laser Deposition and Sputtering. Another approach to lower the operation temperature of SOFCs is the bi-layer structure electrolyte. The functional layer via thin film deposition could guarantee minimum power density loss and stable operation. After the study of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) condition to deposit Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) on Gadonilia doped Cerate (GDC) substrate, GDC/YSZ bi-layered electrolyte button cells showed higher OCV and larger limiting current with 100 nm YSZ ultra thin film. The performance improvement might be attributed to the function of electron blocking and cutting off the reducible gas...|$|E

40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are {{devices that}} {{directly}} convert chemical energy into electrical energy, without proceeding through a Carnot combustion cycle. These devices {{are based on}} the usage of solid oxide electrolytes operating at relatively elevated temperatures. Two major hurdles must be overcome in order to decrease the operating temperatures of practical SOFCs. The first relates to reducing ohmic losses within solid electrolytes. The second relates to the need for developing high performance electrodes since electrolyte reaction rates at both anode and cathode are affected detrimentally as operating temperatures fall. This PhD project has focussed on addressing the first hurdle in two innovative ways: 1. the implementation of solid electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity than zirconia, 2. the development of very <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolytes</b> as thick as 5 µm. Several <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with novel electrode-electrolyte structures were fabricated and evaluated in order to demonstrate the viability of low temperature SOFC operations. Development of such <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> was innovative and challenging to achieve. The approach taken in this work involved fabricating a dense and thin gadolinia doped ceria (10 GDC - Gd 10 wt%, Ce 90 wt%) oxide electrolyte. 10 GDC is an electrolyte exhibiting higher conductivities than conventional materials during low temperature operations. A research contribution of this PhD was the demonstration of the deposition of 10 GDC <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> using RF magnetron sputtering for the first time. 10 GDC <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolytes</b> with thickness in a range between 0. 1 to 5 µm were fabricated on 10 yttrium stabilised zirconium (10 YSZ) substrates by using a RF magnetron sputterer. The primary parameters controlling 10 GDC <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition using this method were explored in order to identify optimal conditions. The fabricated films were subsequently analysed for their morphology, composition and stoichiometry using a variety of methods, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), optical microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). A preliminary test was conducted in order to examine the function of 10 GDC <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolytes</b> together with the cathode and anode substrates at intermediate temperatures (700 oC). A complete planar single cell was designed and assembled for this purpose. However, when fully assembled and tested, the cell failed to generate any voltage or current. Consequently, the remainder of the PhD work was focused on systematically exploring the factors contributing to the assembled fuel cell failure. As fabrication failure analysis is seldom reported in the scientific literature, this analysis represents a significant scientific contribution. This analysis proceeded in a series of steps that involved several different methods, including SEM, red dye analysis, surface morphology and cross section analysis of the cell. It was found that pinholes and cracks were present during the fuel cell operating test. Cathode delamination was also found to have occurred during the test operation. This was determined to be due to thermal expansion mismatch between the cathode substrate and the 10 GDC <b>electrolyte</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> A series of suggestions for future research are presented in the conclusion of this work...|$|R

For example, at a fuel utilization of 80 % and an oxygen utilization of 20 %, the efficiency of ammonia fed SOFC-H is 11 % {{higher than that of}} SOFC-O. The difference between SOFC-H and SOFC-O becomes more significant at higher fuel utilizations and higher temperatures. This is because an SOFC-H has a higher hydrogen partial pressure and a lower steam partial pressure than an SOFC-O. In addition, an increase in oxygen utilization is found to increase the efficiency of ammonia fed SOFCs due to an increase in oxygen molar fraction and a reduction in steam molar fraction.

Scaling towards miniaturization is accomplished by utilizing novel micromaching approaches which allow manifold channels and fuel delivery system to be formed within the substrate which the thin film fuel cell stack is fabricated on, thereby circumventing the need for bulky manifold components which are not directly scalable...|$|E
40|$|Age-hardenable {{aluminum}} alloys used in aerospace structures {{are susceptible to}} environment assisted fatigue crack propagation (EFCP). There has been no controlled examination of <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolyte,</b> typically produced by atmospheric exposures, effects on EFCP or inhibition of such cracking. The goal {{of this research is}} to understand EFCP and inhibition for atmospheric conditions of important aerospace alloys: 7075 -T 651 (Al-Zn-Mg-Cu) and C 47 A-T 8 (Al-Cu-Li). A candidate chromate (CrO 42 -) replacement inhibitor, molybdate (MoO 42 -), is examined. MoO 42 - effectively inhibits EFCP in 7075 -T 651 stressed during full immersion in chloride solution; as understood by hydrogen environment embrittlement and film stability where MoO 42 - promotes crack tip passivity, thus reducing H uptake. MoO 42 - inhibition is promoted by reduced loading frequency and stress intensity range and potentials at or anodic to free corrosion. The inhibiting effect of MoO 42 - parallels that of CrO 42 -, but is shifted to lower frequencies suggesting the Mo-bearing passive film is less stable under crack tip deformation than the Cr-bearing. MoO 42 - can fully inhibit EFCP by reducing crack growth rate to that of ultra-high vacuum. For slightly anodic potentials, full crack arrest occurs. This research aims to improve fatigue life prediction for safe and economic operations of aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are very {{attractive}} as energy generation devices {{because they are}} clean, reliable, and almost entirely pollution-free. SOFCs have flexible fuel selections compared with other fuel cell technologies. The main disadvantage of SOFCs is their high operating temperature (~ 1000 ?C for conventional SOFCs) which leads to cell cracking and formation of non-conducting compounds at electrolyte/electrode interfaces. Therefore, intermediate temperature SOFCs (ITSOFCs) {{in the range of}} 500 - 700 ?C has attracted extensive research interests. To achieve high cell performance at reduced temperatures, it requires high-catalytic activity, high ionic conductivity, and comparable thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the cell components. To address the above issues, the research focuses on two main approaches (i. e., the interlayer approach and the electrolyte approach) in order to improve the overall cell performance. First, the design of a thin layer of a vertically-aligned nanocomposite (VAN) structure as an interlayer between the electrolyte and cathode is demonstrated. The development of the VAN structures consisted of the cathode material as a perovskite or ordered double perovskite structure, La 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 CoO 3 (LSCO) or PrBaCo 2 O 5 delta (PBCO), and the electrolyte material as a fluorite structure, Ce 0. 9 Gd 0. 1 O 1. 95 (CGO or GDC), were achieved for <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solid oxide fuel cell (TFSOFCs). The VAN structure significantly improves the overall performance of the TFSOFC by increasing the interfacial area between the electrolyte and cathode and also acts as a transition layer that improves adhesion and relieves both thermal stress and lattice strain. Second, microstructural and electrical properties of Gd-doped CeO 2 (GDC, Ce 0. 9 Gd 0. 1 O 1. 95) <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> <b>electrolyte</b> are studied for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The GDC <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>electrolytes</b> with different grain sizes and grain morphologies were prepared by varying the deposition parameters such as substrate temperature, oxygen partial pressure, target repetition rate, and laser ablation energy. The electrical property of the GDC <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> is strongly affected by the grain size. Third, bilayer electrolytes composed of a gadolinium-doped CeO 2 (GDC) layer (~ 6 micrometer thickness) and an yttria-stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ) layer with various thicknesses (~ 330 nm, ~ 440 nm, and ~ 1 micrometer) are achieved by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique for <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solid oxide fuel cells (TFSOFCs). One effective approach is to incorporate YSZ <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> as a blocking layer in between the GDC and anode for preventing chemical reduction of GDC and electrical current leakage. This bilayer approach effectively improves the GDC's chemical/ mechanical stability and reduces the OCV loss under reducing conditions. The results suggest that the YSZ <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> serves as a blocking layer for preventing electrical current leakage in the GDC layer and also provides chemical, mechanical, and structural integrity in the cell, which leads to the overall enhanced performance...|$|R
