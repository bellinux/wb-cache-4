25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E

500|$|At the German Grand Prix in July, Red Bull Racing were {{referred}} to race stewards after FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer noted that their engine maps {{had the potential to}} violate the technical regulations. Red Bull stood accused of manipulating the relationship between the torque produced by the Red Bull RB8 {{and the degree to which}} the throttle was open – particularly in medium-speed corners – thereby allowing more air to pass through the exhaust and over the diffuser, generating more downforce. Red Bull were cleared of wrongdoing, as, in the stewards' words, they had not technically broken any rules, but the FIA announced plans to rewrite the regulations governing throttle mapping so as to outlaw the practice entirely ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix one week later. The rule changes required teams to submit an engine map used during one of the first four races of the season, which became known as the [...] "reference map". Any subsequent changes to the throttle map would require the approval of the FIA, provided that the <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> above 6,000 rpm was within two percent of the output specified on the reference map. Further changes would be allowed at races with [...] "exceptional atmospheric conditions", as designated by the FIA.|$|E

2500|$|Torque {{is part of}} {{the basic}} {{specification}} of an engine: the power output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the axis. Internal-combustion engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000–6,000 rpm for a small car). The varying <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> over that range can be [...] measured with a dynamometer, and shown as a torque curve.|$|E
2500|$|The S3 {{received}} the 2.2 L Type 912 engine. The Turbo Esprit had a wet sump engine {{with the same}} power and <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> as its dry sump predecessor.

The Turbo Esprit retained the aerodynamic body kit of the Essex cars and featured prominent 'turbo esprit' decals on the nose and sides. The S3 gained the new larger bumpers but kept the simpler sill line and glazed rear hatch of the S2.2 body. Both cars came with [...] BBS alloy wheels.|$|E

2500|$|Land Rover South Africa {{offered a}} unique Defender {{during the period}} the group was owned by BMW. Between 1997 and 2001, the Defender 90 and 110 were offered with a BMW petrol engine {{alongside}} the normal Tdi engine. The engine was the BMW M52 2793 cc, straight-six, 24-valve engine as found in the BMW 328i, 528i, 728i, and the Z3. Power and <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> for this engine was [...] @ 5300 rpm and [...] @ 3950 rpm. [...] This option was offered due to a demand for a petrol-driven alternative to the diesel engine after production of the V8 Defender had ended. [...] The vehicles were built at Rosslyn outside Pretoria. Total production for the 2.8i was 1395, which included 656 Defender 90s and 739 Defender 110s. This is an estimate based on sales figures from the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA). Early models were not speed-restricted, but later models were limited to 160km/h.|$|E
2500|$|The Lexus LFA {{is powered}} by a 72-degree bank angle 4.8-liter V10 engine {{equipped}} with dual VVT-i carrying the 1LR-GUE designation with a maximum output of [...] delivered at 8,700rpm. Its maximum <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> of [...] arrives at 6,800rpm, 90percent of which is available from 3,700rpm. The engine redlines at 9,000rpm, but with a fuel cutoff set at 9,500rpm, and is constructed using forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, and solid titanium valves. The V-angle of the LFA's V-10 engine is set to 72-degrees to fully balance the firing force from the pistons. This 72-degree angle allows for even firing from the pistons without the use of a split-journal crankshaft, thus improving engine efficiency as well as lowering overall weight. Dry sump lubrication prevents engine oil starvation through high speed corners and lowers the engine's center of mass. Air is fed directly from beneath the hood through a visible slit passing into a dual stage variable intake manifold and then into ten individual throttle bodies before finally exiting from a dual-stage titanium muffler.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the late}} {{introduction}} of the GSX, a prototype was displayed at the Chicago Motor Show in February 1970, very little model specific advertising was done. The GSX did not appear {{in any of the}} model catalogs for 1970 having been released long after catalog printing had been completed. Only 678 GSXs were produced {{in the second half of}} the 1970 model year beginning in March 1970. Just 278 were equipped with the standard 455, a further 400 purchasers selected the optional Stage 1 performance package. The performance of a GSX (or GS) Stage-1 is comparable to and possibly surpasses that of the HemiCuda, but in a much more luxurious car. The impressive performance is partly due to the light weight of the 455 which is roughly [...] less than the 426 Hemi or Chevrolet 454. At 510lb-ft the Buick 455 produced the highest <b>torque</b> <b>output</b> of any American production performance car, a record held for 33 years until finally surpassed by the Series 2 V10 Viper in 2003. The 1970 Buick GSX has arguably the most extensive list of standard high performance features of any classic era muscle car.|$|E

2500|$|From Spring 2007 {{a series}} of changes {{were made to the}} Defender, most of which were {{implemented}} to meet emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine was replaced by an engine from Ford's DuraTorq line (AKA the Puma engine), built in their factory in Dagenham, making the Td5 the last Land Rover engine to be built in-house at Solihull. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit. The engine's lubrication and sealing system was adapted for use in wet, dusty conditions and to maintain lubrication at extreme angles in off-road use. The power level remains the same at , but with a lower power peak speed for towing and better acceleration. <b>Torque</b> <b>output</b> rose from [...] to [...] due to the fitting of a variable-geometry turbocharger. This produces a wider spread of torque than the Td5, from 1500rpm to 2000rpm. The engine is mated to a new six-speed gearbox. First gear is lower than the previous gearbox for better low-speed control, whilst the higher sixth gear is intended to reduce noise and fuel consumption at high speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The Series II Land Rover {{launched}} in 1958 was larger, heavier {{and more complex}} than the original, and there was an ever-present need for higher powered engines. Also, the Rover petrol engines in use at the time, with the archaic Inlet-Over-Exhaust valve layout and were approaching the age of 20 years in design terms. A new, larger petrol engine specifically developed for the Land Rover was needed. The existing 2-litre diesel engine was used as a basis, but with a radically changed internal structure. The new engine was a ‘dry-liner' type, and a wider bore was used to improve low-speed <b>torque</b> <b>output.</b> Despite the numerous changes the petrol engine could use the same machining line as the diesel, establishing a design commonly used between Land Rover's petrol and diesel engines that would survive for decades. The 2.25-litre petrol was the most popular engine option right up to the mid-1980s and established a worldwide reputation for reliability and longevity. The engine's relatively low compression ratio [...] and general strong design made it tolerant of poor quality fuel and oil as well as infrequent servicing. With proper maintenance these engines can easily survive more than 250,000 miles of service. This was partly due to the commonality between petrol and diesel versions making the petrol version somewhat over-engineered for the job; they retained the extraordinary strength characteristics of the diesel while being much less stressed. The only major change to the design was the fitting of a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980, which improved bottom-end strength and refinement. Despite its utilitarian origins, the 2.25-litre petrol is a quiet, smooth-running engine, and this enabled Rover to fit it to their P4 saloon car as the Rover 80. Various power outputs were available for this engine depending on the compression ratio and the amount of emissions regulation equipment fitted.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though the}} S4PH engine had {{contemporary}} maximum power and <b>torque</b> <b>outputs,</b> its performance was reportedly sluggish {{in real world}} driving. This performance deficiency was attributed to a pronounced torque dip in the crucial 2,000 to 3,000 rpm mid engine speed range where torque actually decreased before picking up back to the maximum torque level at 4,000 rpm. This torque characteristic could clearly be seen in manufacturer published engine performance curves.|$|R
