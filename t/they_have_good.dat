5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E

Playmakers usually play as central midfielders or attacking midfielders, but some play as defensive midfielders (known as deep-lying playmakers).|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} ultras {{group of}} Inter is Boys San; they hold a significant {{place in the}} history of the ultras scene in general due to the fact that they are one of the oldest, being founded in 1969. Politically, the ultras of Inter are usually considered right-wing and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> relationships with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group of Boys San, there are four more significant groups: Viking, Irriducibili, Ultras, and Brianza Alcoolica.|$|E

25|$|Some drummers {{arrive at}} the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands {{provided}} by the venue's sound engineer. Other drummers bring their all of their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., a good quality bass drum mic and a good mic for the snare) to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> quality mics for each show. In bars and nightclubs, the microphones supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.|$|E
25|$|Tame {{reindeer}} {{are known}} to be curious, but even wild reindeer can be curious in some situations. The wild reindeer is a shy animal and it reacts very quickly to sudden sounds or movements as well as the smell of strangers. In spite of this, inexperienced animals may even approach quite closely to a hunter and curiously observe while the hunter is field dressing a downed animal. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> hearing and a good sense of smell, but have poor eyesight. They may react to a hunter's movements, but not necessarily to his form if he doesn't move. Under the right conditions, a stealthy hunter may be able to approach surprisingly close to a reindeer, even when the hunter is in full sight of the animal. Many animals are shot at relatively close range (10–50 meters).|$|E

25|$|The {{described}} system handles extremely well, {{as it is}} able {{to accommodate}} various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.|$|E

[...] This classification is often subdivided into two separate categories for para-Alpine skiing. In July 1997, at the World Cup Technical Meeting for para-Alpine skiing, this classes was subdivided into two classes {{in order to improve}} factoring for the range of disabilities found within the class at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Darrieus wind turbine: [...] "Eggbeater" [...] turbines, or Darrieus turbines, {{were named}} after the French inventor, Georges Darrieus. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> efficiency, but produce large torque ripple and {{cyclical}} stress on the tower, which contributes to poor reliability. They also generally require some external power source, or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning, because the starting torque is very low. The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor. Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area. Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wires but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors {{associated}} with death {{in a group of}} malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree. The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age. The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition. An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being [...] "arbitrary" [...] and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone {{may not be the best}} indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> nutrition.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{college is}} mainly used by private or {{independent}} secondary schools with Advanced Level (Upper 6th formers) and also Polytechnic Colleges which confer diplomas only. A student can complete secondary education (International General Certificate of Secondary Education, IGCSE) at 16 years and proceed straight to a poly-technical college {{or they can}} proceed to Advanced level (16 to 19 years) and obtain a General Certificate of Education (GCE) certificate which enables them to enrol at a University, provided <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> grades. [...] Alternatively, with lower grades the GCE certificate holders will have an added advantage over their GCSE counterparts {{if they choose to}} enrol at a Poly-technical College. [...] Some schools in Zimbabwe choose to offer the International Baccalaureate studies {{as an alternative to the}} IGCSE and GCE.|$|E
