40|$|We {{describe}} a beta-spectrin variant, named beta-spectrin Bari, {{characterized by a}} truncated chain and associated with hereditary spherocytosis. The clinical phenotype consists of a moderately severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and spherocytes and acanthocytes in the blood smear. The occurrence of the truncated protein, that represents about 8 % of the total beta-spectrin occurring on the membrane, results in a marked spectrin deficiency. The altered protein {{is due to a}} single point mutation at position - 2 (A -> G) of the acceptor splice site of intron 16 leading to an aberrant beta-spectrin message skipping exons 16 and 17 indistinguishable from that reported for beta-spectrin Winston-Salem. We provide evidence that the mutated gene is transcribed but its mRNA is less abundant than either its normal counterpart or beta-spectrin Winston-Salem mRNA. Our findings are an example of how mutations in different splice sites, although causing the same <b>truncating</b> <b>effect,</b> result in clearly different clinical pictures...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{two decades}} of {{extensive}} research, direct experimental evidence of a dynamical length scale determining the glass transition of confined polymers has yet to emerge. Using a recently established experimental technique of interface micro-rheology we provide evidence of finite-size <b>effect</b> <b>truncating</b> {{the growth of a}} quantity proportional to a dynamical length scale in confined glassy polymers, on cooling towards the glass transition temperature. We show how the interplay of variation of polymer film thickness and this temperature-dependent growing dynamical length scale determines the glass transition temperature, which in our case of 2 - 3 nm thick films, is reduced significantly as compared to their bulk values...|$|R

40|$|In fluid mechanics, {{it is well}} {{accepted}} that the Euler equation {{is one of the}} reduced forms of the Navier-Stokes equation by <b>truncating</b> the viscous <b>effect.</b> There are other truncation techniques currently being used in order to truncate the Navier-Stokes equation to a reduced form. This paper describes one such technique, suitable for adaptive domain decomposition methods for the solution of viscous flow problems. The physical domain of a viscous flow problem is partitioned into viscous and inviscid subdomains without overlapping regions, and the technique is embedded into a finite volume method. Some numerical results are provided for a flat plate and the NACA 0012 aerofoil. Issues related to distributed computing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} question has arisen {{as to why}} robust coherences have been observed in so many driven chemical and biophysical systems containing large numbers of components (e. g. dimers), and whether these coherences can be truly quantum mechanical. Because of these systems' inherent many-body complexity, theoretical treatments to date have made approximations such as limiting the number N of system components (e. g. one dimer N= 1), <b>truncating</b> non-Markovian <b>effects,</b> and treating aspects of the system as stochastic or averaged. Here we avoid these assumptions by analyzing the exact real-time evolution of a driven, generic out-of-equilibrium vibrational-electronic system that comprises an arbitrary number of components (e. g. dimers) N. Our results predict that {{a new form of}} dynamically-driven quantum coherence can arise surprisingly easily for general N and without having to access the empirically challenging strong-coupling regime. The resulting electronic-vibrational entanglement is driven by the speed of changes in the internal dynamics, and is accompanied by distinct yet complementary non-classicalities within each subsystem that have eluded previous analyses. Our findings show robustness to losses and noise, and have functional implications at the systems level {{for a wide range of}} chemical, biophysical and also physical systems.

40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{detailed}} study of the orbital dynamics and structural evolution of over 6000 subhalos in the Via Lactea II simulation, from infall to present. By analyzing subhalos with masses down to m = 4 e 5 Msun, we find that lower mass subhalos, which are not strongly affected by dynamical friction, exhibit behaviors qualitatively different from those found previously for more massive ones. Furthermore, {{there is a clear}} trend of subhalos that fell into the host earlier being less concentrated. We show that the concentration at infall characterizes various aspects of subhalo evolution. In particular, tidal <b>effects</b> <b>truncate</b> the growth of less concentrated subhalos at larger distances from the host; subhalos with smaller concentrations have larger infall radii. The concentration at infall is further shown to be a determining factor for the subsequent mass loss of subhalos within the host, and also for the evolution of their internal structure in the v_max-r_max plane. Our findings raise the prospects of using the concentration to predict the tidal evolution of subhalos, which will be useful for obtaining analytic models of galaxy formation, as well as for near field cosmology.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the bounds {{which can be}} placed on generic new-physics contributions to dijet production at the LHC using {{the framework of the}} Standard Model Effective Field Theory, deriving the first consistently-treated EFT bounds from non-resonant high-energy data. We recast an analysis searching for quark compositeness, equivalent to treating the SM with one higher-dimensional operator as a complete UV model. In order to reach consistent, model-independent EFT conclusions, it is necessary to <b>truncate</b> the EFT <b>effects</b> consistently at order 1 /Λ^ 2 and to include the possibility of multiple operators simultaneously contributing to the observables, neither of which has been done in previous searches of this nature. Furthermore, it is important to give consistent error estimates for the theoretical predictions of the signal model, particularly in the region of phase space where the probed energy is approaching the cutoff scale of the EFT. There are two linear combinations of operators which contribute to dijet production in the SMEFT with distinct angular behavior; we identify those linear combinations and determine the ability of LHC searches to constrain them simultaneously. Consistently treating the EFT generically leads to weakened bounds on new-physics parameters. These constraints will be a useful input to future global analyses in the SMEFT framework, and the techniques used here to consistently search for EFT effects are directly applicable to other off-resonance signals.

40|$|Summary Peutz–Jeghers {{syndrome}} (PJS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease {{characterized by}} hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps and mucocutaneous pigmentation, {{with an increased}} risk for various neoplasms, including gastrointestinal cancer. Recently, the PJS gene encoding the serine/threonine kinase STK 11 (also named LKB 1) was mapped to chromosome 19 p 13. 3, and germline mutations were identified in PJS patients. We screened a total of ten Korean PJS patients (nine sporadic cases and one familial case including two patients) to investigate the germline mutations of the STK 11 gene. By polymerase chain reaction–single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis, three kinds of mis-sense mutation and a frame-shift mutation were identified: codon 232 (TCC to CCC) in exon 5, codon 256 (GAA to GCA) in exon 6, codon 324 (CCG to CTG) in exon 8, and a guanine insertion at codon 342 resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 8. These mis-sense variants were not detected in 100 control DNA samples. Furthermore, we found an intronic mutation at the dinucleotide sequence of a splice-acceptor site: a one base substitution from AG to CG in intron 1, which may cause aberrant splicing. Most reported germline mutations of the STK 11 gene in PJS patients were frame-shift or non-sense mutations resulting in truncated proteins. Together, these findings indicate that germline mis-sense mutations of the STK 11 gene are found in PJS patients in addition to <b>truncating</b> mutations.

40|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is {{a chronic}} progressive or relapsing and remitting disease that usually causes weakness and sensory loss. The symptoms {{are due to}} autoimmune inflammation of peripheral nerves. CIPD affects about 2 to 3 per 100, 000 of the population. More than half of affected people cannot walk unaided when symptoms are at their worst. CIDP usually responds to treatments that reduce inflammation, but there is disagreement about which treatment is most effective. To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (CSRs) and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of any treatment for CIDP and to compare the effects of treatments. We considered all systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment for any form of CIDP. We reported their primary outcomes, giving priority to change in disability after 12 months. Two overview authors independently identified published systematic reviews for inclusion and collected data. We reported the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. Two other review authors independently checked review selection, data extraction and quality assessments. On 31 October 2016, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (in theCochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus for systematic reviews of CIDP. We supplemented the RCTs in the existing CSRs by searching on the same date for RCTs of any treatment of CIDP (including treatment of fatigue or pain in CIDP), in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus. Five CSRs met our inclusion criteria. We identified 23 randomised trials, of which 15 had been included in these CSRs. We were unable to compare treatments as originally planned, because outcomes and outcome intervals differed. CorticosteroidsIt is uncertain whether daily oral prednisone improved impairment compared to no treatment because {{the quality of the}} evidence was very low (1 trial, 28 participants). According to moderate-quality evidence (1 trial, 41 participants), six months' treatment with high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone did not improve disability more than daily oral prednisolone. Observational studies tell us that prolonged use of corticosteroids sometimes causes serious side-effects. Plasma exchangeAccording to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 59 participants), twice-weekly plasma exchange produced more short-term improvement in disability than sham exchange. In the largest observational study, 3. 9 % of plasma exchange procedures had complications. Intravenous immunoglobulinAccording to high-quality evidence (5 trials, 269 participants), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) produced more short-term improvement than placebo. Adverse events were more common with IVIg than placebo (high-quality evidence), but serious adverse events were not (moderate-quality evidence, 3 trials, 315 participants). One trial with 19 participants provided moderate-quality evidence of little or no difference in short-term improvement of impairment with plasma exchange in comparison to IVIg. There was little or no difference in short-term improvement of disability with IVIg in comparison to oral prednisolone (moderate-quality evidence; 1 trial, 29 participants) or intravenous methylprednisolone (high-quality evidence; 1 trial, 45 participants). One unpublished randomised open trial with 35 participants found little or no difference in disability after three months of IVIg compared to oral prednisone; this trial has not yet been included in a CSR. We know from observational studies that serious adverse events related to IVIg do occur. Other immunomodulatory treatmentsIt is uncertain whether the addition of azathioprine (2 mg/kg) to prednisone improved impairment in comparison to prednisone alone, as the quality of the evidence is very low (1 trial, 27 participants). Observational studies show that adverse <b>effects</b> <b>truncate</b> treatment in 10 % of people. According to low-quality evidence (1 trial, 60 participants), compared to placebo, methotrexate 15 mg/kg did not allow more participants to reduce corticosteroid or IVIg doses by 20 %. Serious adverse events were no more common with methotrexate than with placebo, but observational studies show that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity, abnormal liver function, and pulmonary fibrosis. According to moderate-quality evidence (2 trials, 77 participants), interferon beta- 1 a (IFN beta- 1 a) in comparison to placebo, did not allow more people to withdraw from IVIg. According to moderate-quality evidence, serious adverse events were no more common with IFN beta- 1 a than with placebo. We know of no other completed trials of immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents for CIDP. Other treatmentsWe identified no trials of treatments for fatigue or pain in CIDP. Adverse effectsNot all trials routinely collected adverse event data; when they did, the quality of evidence was variable. Adverse effects in the short, medium, and long term occur with all interventions. We are not able to make reliable comparisons of adverse events between the interventions included in CSRs. We cannot be certain based on available evidence whether daily oral prednisone improves impairment compared to no treatment. However, corticosteroids are commonly used, based on widespread availability, low cost, very low-quality evidence from observational studies, and clinical experience. The weakness of the evidence {{does not necessarily mean that}} corticosteroids are ineffective. High-dose monthly oral dexamethasone for six months is probably no more or less effective than daily oral prednisolone. Plasma exchange produces short-term improvement in impairment as determined by neurological examination, and probably produces short-term improvement in disability. IVIg produces more short-term improvement in disability than placebo and more adverse events, although serious side effects are probably no more common than with placebo. There is no clear difference in short-term improvement in impairment with IVIg when compared with intravenous methylprednisolone and probably no improvement when compared with either oral prednisolone or plasma exchange. According to observational studies, adverse events related to difficult venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes occur in 3 % to 17 % of plasma exchange procedures. It is uncertain whether azathioprine is of benefit as the quality of evidence is very low. Methotrexate may not be of benefit and IFN beta- 1 a is probably not of benefit. We need further research to identify predictors of response to different treatments and to compare their long-term benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness. There is a need for more randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, routes of administration, and treatments for symptoms of CID...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mood and Anxiety {{disorders}} have {{a profound}} personal and socioeconomic impact. Response and remission rates from orthodox pharmacotherapies currently have moderate efficacy: more options are needed. Herbal and complementary medicines offer promise {{for the treatment of}} depression and anxiety, however research in this area is still in its infancy. Aims: To research the current evidence for herbal and complementary medicines in the treatment of mood (specifically unipolar depression) and anxiety disorders. To identify areas of interest where there are gaps in the literature, and to subsequently conduct two clinical trials in these areas. The research design aimed to create a thesis ‘by publication’, detailing 13 publications that pertain to the area of herbal and complementary medicine and mood and anxiety disorders. Process: Initial literature reviews on herbal medicine and psychiatric disorders, nutritional medicine and major depression, and exercise and depression were conducted to develop knowledge in the area and ascertain the gaps in the literature. Results revealed that in respect to nutritional medicines, varying levels of supportive evidence exists for using omega- 3, folate, Sadenosyl methionine (SAMe), and L-Tryptophan as monotherapies and with synthetic pharmacotherapies to treat unipolar depression. A review of exercise in the treatment of depression revealed robust evidence for the use of physical activity as a mood elevating intervention. In regards to herbal interventions, Hypericum perforatum (St John’s wort: SJW) and Piper methysticum (Kava) were found to have the most evidence in the herbal treatment of depression and anxiety, respectively. A subsequent literature review was conducted on these herbal medicines. SJW was revealed via review of randomised controlled studies and meta-analyses to be equally effective to antidepressants in treating major depressive disorder. This activity is posited to occur via modulation of neurotransmission and neuroendocrine pathways, including non-selective inhibition of re-uptake of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, decreased degradation of neurochemicals and sensitisation and binding to various neuroreceptors, dopaminergic activity (prefrontal cortex) and cortisol/hypothalmic pituitary adrenal -axis modulation. Kava was also revealed to have meta-analytic evidence in support of anxiolytic activity. This is postulated to occur via GABA membrane modulation, weak GABA binding and blockage of voltage-gated channels, and β-adrenergic downregulation. From this review a deficit in the area of treating comorbid depression and anxiety was identified, and no studies were found using SJW and Kava concomitantly. Due to this, the first study was formulated and conducted, hypothesising that a combination of SJW and Kava may be more effective in reducing participants’ co-occurring depression and anxiety than placebo. First clinical trial: A world-first randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot trial was conducted, involving SJW and Kava in the treatment of major depressive disorder and comorbid anxiety. Twenty eight adults with major depressive disorder and co-occurring anxiety were recruited. After a placebo run-in of two weeks, the trial had a crossover design testing SJW and Kava against placebo over two controlled phases, each of four weeks. The primary analyses used intention-to-treat and completer analyses. On both intention-to-treat (p = 0. 047) and completer analyses (p = 0. 003), SJW and Kava gave a significantly greater reduction in selfreported depression on the Beck Depression Inventory II over placebo in the first controlled phase. However in the crossover phase, a replication of those effects in the delayed medication group did not occur. Nor were there significant effects on anxiety or quality of life. Possible explanations for the absence of anxiolysis may include a potential interaction with SJW, the presence of depression, or an inadequate dose of Kava. Furthermore, the high dropout significantly reduced the statistical power of the study, precluding firm conclusions. Second clinical trial: The next study sought to determine if the presence of depression affected participants’ anxiolysis from Kava by using a sample of people with chronic anxiety and varying levels of depression. The hypothesis was that higher levels of depression may <b>truncate</b> the anxiolytic <b>effect</b> from Kava. A supplementary aim {{of the study was to}} use an aqueous extract of Kava, which in light of hepatotoxic effects from acetone and ethanol based preparations (and incorrect plant parts and cultivars) may be potentially safer. No previous clinical trials had used a traditional aqueous extract. The Kava Anxiety Depression Spectrum Study (KADSS) was a 3 -week placebo-controlled, doubleblind, crossover trial in participants with elevated generalised anxiety. Piper methysticum (Kava) has been withdrawn in European, British, and Canadian markets due to concerns over hepatotoxic reactions. The WHO recently recommended research into ‘aqueous’ extracts of Kava, which may be a safer formulation of the herb (as opposed to non-traditional acetone or ethanol extracts). Sixty adult participants currently experiencing one month or more of generalised anxiety were prescribed 5 tablets per day of Kava containing 50 mg of kavalactones (250 mg/day). Results revealed the pooled effect of Kava vs. placebo across phases was highly significant (p < 0. 0001), with a substantial effect size (d = 2. 24, ηp 2 =. 428). Pooled analyses also revealed highly significant relative reductions on the Beck Anxiety Inventory. A previously undiscovered antidepressant effect was revealed with highly significant reductions of depression scores occurring on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (p = 0. 003, d = 0. 75 ηp 2 =. 223). The aqueous extract was found to be safe, with no serious adverse effects, and no clinical hepatotoxicity. The aqueous Kava extract appears equally effective in cases where anxiety is accompanied by depression. This should encourage further study and consideration of globally reintroducing aqueous rootstock extracts of Kava for the management of anxiety. Conclusions: A review of the literature revealed that in the area of herbal and nutritional treatments of depression and anxiety, strong evidence exists for SJW in the treatment of depression, and for Kava in the treatment of generalised anxiety. Other herbal medicine monotherapies in the treatment of depression or anxiety or other psychiatric disorders currently have insufficient evidence to firmly recommend use. In respect to nutritional interventions, SAMe, L-Tryptophan, omega- 3 and folate have limited evidence as monotherapies, while as adjuvants to antidepressants they have evidentiary support. Aside from exercise and relaxation interventions, other complementary medicine interventions currently possess limited evidence in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. The conclusions from the first study indicate that use of SJW and Kava concomitantly appears to not be an effective treatment of anxiety with or without co-occurring depression. The second study supports that an aqueous extract of Kava is an effective acute anxiolytic and tentatively demonstrates antidepressant properties. Possible future steps involve further exploration and clinical studies of promising medicinal plants in the treatment of depression or anxiety as monotherapies (or as augmenting agents with pharmacotherapies), while a larger and longer phase III Kava clinical trial is required to confirm the results of KADSS...|$|R
