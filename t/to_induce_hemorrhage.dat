50|$|The beta-toxin of C. histolyticum is a {{group of}} seven {{collagen}}ases. Collagenases are zinc metalloproteases that cleave collagen and gelatin into small fragments. The seven collagenases are alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta. They are further identified by their molecular masses (68, 115,79,110, 125, and 130 kDa, respectively) to distinguish them from the five toxins. Beta-toxin {{plays a major role in}} the pathogenicity of C. histolyticum, due to its ability to destroy collagen fibers in the body and cause necrosis. Beta-toxin has been shown <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> when placed on the surface of lungs of animals, hemorrhage and edema when injected into rat paws, and lethal intrapulmonary hemorrhage when injected intravenously into animals.|$|E
40|$|Protein-protein {{interfaces}} have crucial {{functions in}} many biological processes. The large interaction areas of such interfaces show complex interaction motifs. Even more challenging is {{the understanding of}} (multi) specificity in protein-protein binding. Many proteins can bind several partners to mediate their function. A perfect paradigm to study such multispecific protein-protein interfaces are snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs). Inherently, they bind {{to a variety of}} basement membrane proteins of capillaries, hydrolyze them, and induce profuse bleeding. However, despite having a high sequence homology, some SVMPs show a strong hemorrhagic activity, while others are (almost) inactive. We present computer simulations indicating that the activity <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> and thus the capability to bind the potential reaction partners, is related to the backbone flexibility in a certain surface region. A subtle interplay between flexibility and rigidity of two loops seems to be the prerequisite for the proteins to carry out their damaging function. Presumably, a significant alteration in the backbone dynamics makes the difference between SVMPs that induce hemorrhage and the inactive ones.

This study characterized the capillary <b>hemorrhage</b> <b>induced</b> in rat pancreas. The pancreata of anesthetized hairless rats were accessed by laparotomy. A 1. 5 MHz diagnostic ultrasound probe with 2. 3 MPa peak rarefactional pressure amplitude and 1 s intermittent trigger was used to scan the pancreas, located at the focus (3. 8 cm), through saline coupling. The probe was swept to expose the entire organ in 5 min during infusion of Definity® contrast agent at 10 µL/kg/min, and this was repeated in a reverse sweep. The entire pancreas was removed, spread flat for fixation and histological slides were prepared from the mid-plane. Slides were scored blind for islet hemorrhage over the entire area of the organ. Intra-islet microlesions were evident and hemorrhage surrounded many islets. The hemorrhage often impacted nearby acini, and expanded into inter-lobular septa. In CEDUS pancreata removed soon after scanning, 76. 2 ± 11. 8 % (n =  6) of islets had evidence of hemorrhage and/or islet microlesions compared to 1. 1 ± 2. 5 % (n =  5) for sham CEDUS (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Stroke is {{the third}} cause of {{mortality}} and {{the leading cause of}} disability in the World. Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately 80 % of all strokes. However, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only treatment of acute ischemic stroke that exists. This led researchers to develop several ischemic stroke models in a variety of species. Two major types of rodent models have been developed: models of global cerebral ischemia or focal cerebral ischemia. To mimic ischemic stroke in patients, in whom approximately 80 % thrombotic or embolic strokes occur in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model is quite relevant for stroke studies. This model was first developed in rats by Koizumi et al. in 1986 1. Because of the ease of genetic manipulation in mice, these models have also been developed in this species 2 - 3. Herein, we present the transient MCA occlusion procedure in C 57 /Bl 6 mice. Previous studies have reported that physical properties of the occluder such as tip diameter, length, shape, and flexibility are critical for the reproducibility of the infarct volume 4.

40|$|In vivo, hemorrhagic toxins {{isolated}} from snake venoms cause a disorganization of the basal lamina of capillaries, with a concomitant degenerative process of endothelial cells. In {{this study we}} investigated the effects of BaH- 1, a hemorrhagic metalloproteinase purified from the venom of Bothrops asper, on a murine endothelial cell line of capillary origin. A quantitative cytotoxicity assay based on the release of lactic dehydrogenase was utilized. BaH- 1, despite its potent hemorrhagic activity, did not exert direct cytolytic activity on the endothelial cells, even at concentrations as high as 65 micrograms/ml. The only visible effect of BaH- 1 on the cultured cells was a relatively slow, moderate detachment of cells, interpreted {{as a consequence of}} proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix components. In contrast, myotoxin II, a lysine- 49 phospholipase A 2 from the same venom, was clearly cytotoxic to this cell type, albeit being devoid of hemorrhagic activity. These findings suggest that the ability of venom metalloproteinases <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> is not related to a direct cytotoxic action on endothelial cells, and that the rapid degenerative changes of endothelium observed in vivo are probably the result of an indirect mechanism.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to isolate a fibrin(ogen) olytic enzyme from the snake venom of Gloydius blomhoffii siniticus and {{to investigate the}} enzymatic characteristics and hemorrhagic activity of the isolated enzyme as a potential pharmacopuncture agent. Methods: The fibrinolytic enzyme was isolated by using chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fibrin plate assay. The characteristics of the enzyme were determined by using fibrin plate assay, protein hydrolysis analysis, and hemorrhage assay. Its amino acid composition was determined. Results: The fibrin(ogen) olytic enzyme with the molecular weight of 27 kDa (FE- 27 kDa) isolated from G. b. siniticus venom consisted of two heterogenous disulfide bond-linked polypeptides with the molecular weights of 15 kDa and 18 kDa. When more than 20 μg of FE- 27 kDa was applied on the fibrin plate, fibrinolysis zone was formed as indicating its fibrinolytic activity. The fibrinolytic activity was inhibited completely by phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and partially by thiothreitol and cysteine. Metal ions such as Hg 2 + and Fe 2 + inhibited the fibrinolytic activity completely, but Mn 2 + did not. FE- 27 kDa preferentially hydrolyzed α-chain of fibrinogen and slowly hydrolyzed β-chain, but did not hydrolyze γ-chain. High-molecular-weight polypeptides of gelatin were hydrolyzed partially into polypeptides with molecular weights of more than 45 kDa. A dosage of more than 10 μg of FE- 27 kDa per mouse was required <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> beneath the skin. Conclusion: FE- 27 kDa was a serine proteinase consisting of two heterogeneous polypeptides, hydrolyzed fibrin, fibrinogen, and gelatin, and caused hemorrhage beneath the skin of mouse. This study suggests that the potential of FE- 27 kDa as pharmacopuncture agent should be limited due to low fibrinolytic activity and a possible side effect of hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPulsed {{ultrasound}} {{was found}} <b>to</b> <b>induce</b> pulmonary capillary <b>hemorrhage</b> (PCH) in mice about 25 {{years ago but}} remains a poorly understood risk factor for pulmonary diagnostic ultrasound. In early research using laboratory fixed beam ultrasound, thresholds for PCH had frequency variation from 1 - 4 MHz similar to the Mechanical Index. In recent research, thresholds for B mode diagnostic ultrasound from 1. 5 - 12 MHz had little dependence on frequency. To compare the diagnostic ultrasound method to laboratory pulsed exposure, thresholds for fixed beam ultrasound were determined using comparable methods at 1. 5 and 7. 5 MHz. PCH thresholds were lower for simple fixed-beam pulse modes than for B mode and in approximate agreement with early research. However, for comparable timing parameters, PCH thresholds had little dependence on ultrasonic frequency.

Multiple {{components of the}} innate immune response, including complement and neutrophil infiltration, are implicated in this pathology. To investigate the interaction of complement activation and other components of the innate immune response during hemorrhage, we treated mice post-hemorrhage with CR 2 -fH, a targeted inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway and assessed intestinal damage and inflammation 2 h after hemorrhage. In wildtype mice, CR 2 -fH attenuated hemorrhage-induced, mid-jejunal damage and inflammation as determined by decreased mucosal damage, macrophage infiltration, LTB[subscript 4], IL- 12 p 40, and TNF-α production. The critical nature of intestinal macrophage infiltration and activation in the response to hemorrhage was further determined using mice pre-treated with clodronate containing liposomes. The absence of either macrophages or IL- 12 p 70 attenuated intestinal damage.

For the purpose of developing a method to predict CAA-related ICH and other cerebrovascular disorders in AD, the biomarkers and risk factors are reviewed.

The risk factors include (1) old age and AD, (2) CAA-related gene mutations and apolipoprotein E genotype as genetic factors, (3) thrombolytic, anti-coagulation, and anti-platelet therapies, hyertension, and minor head trauma as hemorrhage-inducing factors, and (4) anti-amyloid therapies.

Sprague Dawley rats (n= 39) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either Sham surgery (n= 4), SAH using the "classic" technique (n= 18) or using a modified technique (n= 17). Course of intracranial pressure (ICP) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was analyzed; subsequent pathologies were documented either 6 or 24 h after SAH. Hippocampal tissue samples were analyzed via immunohistochemistry and western blotting. SAH-induction, regardless of confounding pathologies, was independent from type of technique (p= 0. 679). There was no significant difference concerning case fatality rate (classic: 40 %; modified: 20 %; p= 0. 213). Successful induction of SAH without collateral ICH or SDH was possible in 40 % with the classic and in 86. 7 % with the modified technique (p= 0. 008).

40|$|Perinatal stroke {{leads to}} {{significant}} morbidity and long-term neurological and cognitive deficits. The pathophysiological mechanisms of brain damage depend on brain maturation {{at the time}} of stroke. To understand whether microglial cells limit injury after neonatal stroke by preserving neurovascular integrity, we subjected postnatal day 7 (P 7) rats depleted of microglial cells, rats with inhibited microglial TGFbr 2 /ALK 5 signaling, and corresponding controls, to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Microglial depletion by intracerebral injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate at P 5 significantly reduced vessel coverage and triggered hemorrhages in injured regions 24 h after tMCAO. Lack of microglia did not alter expression or intracellular redistribution of several tight junction proteins, did not affect degradation of collagen IV induced by the tMCAO, but altered cell types producing TGFβ 1 and the phosphorylation and intracellular distribution of SMAD 2 / 3. Selective inhibition of TGFbr 2 /ALK 5 signaling in microglia via intracerebral liposome-encapsulated SB- 431542 delivery triggered hemorrhages after tMCAO, demonstrating that TGFβ 1 /TGFbr 2 /ALK 5 signaling in microglia protects from hemorrhages. Consistent with observations in neonatal rats, depletion of microglia before tMCAO in P 9 Cx 3 cr 1 (GFP/+) /Ccr 2 (RFP/+) mice exacerbated injury and <b>induced</b> <b>hemorrhages</b> at 24 h. The effects were independent of infiltration of Ccr 2 (RFP/+) monocytes into injured regions.

We assessed whether microglial cells preserve neurovascular integrity after neonatal stroke. In neonatal rats, microglial depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TGFbr 2 /ALK 5 signaling in microglia triggered hemorrhages in injured regions.

Consistent with observations in neonatal rats, microglial depletion in neonatal mice exacerbated stroke injury and <b>induced</b> <b>hemorrhages.</b> The effects were independent of infiltration of monocytes into injured regions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{synthetic}} peptide (H- 92 -G(110)) identical to the C-terminus of murine S 100 A 9 (mS 100 A 9 p) was investigated on hyperalgesia and edema induced by either jararhagin or papain in the rat paw. mS 100 A 9 p not only reverted hyperalgesia and edema induced by jararhagin, but also the highest concentration <b>induced</b> antinociception. <b>Hemorrhage</b> <b>induced</b> by jararhagin and its hydrolytic activity were inhibited by mS 100 A 9 p. These data suggest that mS 100 A 9 p might block jararhagin-induced hyperalgesia and edema by inhibiting jararhagin catalytic activity, since papain-induced hyperalgesia and edema were not inhibited by mS 100 A 9 p.

This patient developed MMD {{not by the}} onset of cerebral hemorrhage but by the onset of cerebral infarction. We regarded that we should avoid hypocapnia or normocapnea, which would induce cerebral infarction, rather than hypercapnia, which would <b>induce</b> cerebral <b>hemorrhage.</b> But, we cannot ignore that hypercapnia would induce vasodilation and hyper-perfusion of the fragile vessels in the MMD brain, which might cause brain hemorrhage.|$|R
40|$|Low-dose aspirin is an {{important}} therapeutic option in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke, basedon its unique cost-effectiveness and widespread availability. In addition, {{based on the results}} of a number of large studies, aspirin is also widely used in the primary prevention of MI. This paper provides an update of the available data to offer greater clarity regarding the risks of aspirin with respect to hemorrhagic stroke. In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ischemic events, the evidence supports that the benefits of aspirin treatment significantly outweigh the risk of a major hemorrhage. When considering whether aspirin is appropriate, the absolute therapeutic cardiovascular benefits of aspirin must be balanced with the possible risks associated with its use, being hemorrhagic stroke. Regarding these clinical facts, normal, COX 1 −/−, and COX 2 −/− mice were treated with a wide range of doses of aspirin and studied by induced hemorrhagic time. The results outlined three major conclusions: high doses of aspirin <b>induce</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> while low doses of aspirin do not. In the absence of COX 1, ultra low doses of aspirin produce an antihemorrhagic effect not observed with intermediate doses. The absence of COX 2 induced a hemorrhagic effect that needs further research, probably originated in compensatory phenomena...|$|R
