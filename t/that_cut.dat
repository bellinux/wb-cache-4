5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders were}} the descendents of Hova {{who had been}} {{politically}} prominent in the former Merina royal court. The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E

Hughes secured an armbar {{at the end of}} round one, but Lytle was saved by the bell. Hughes opened the second round with a quick takedown, moving up to side-control and then landed an elbow <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> Lytle. Finally, Hughes mounted his opponent, but Lytle swept and was able to reverse that position. In the third round, Hughes unsuccessfully tried an armbar again before the horn sounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech responded on the {{possession}} that ensued with their only touchdown {{of the game}} on a 77-yard Trey Edmunds touchdown run <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> the lead to 14–7. Early in the second quarter, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Logan Thomas pass and returned it 38-yards for a touchdown and a 21–7 lead. The teams then again traded punts before Kyle Fuller intercepted an AJ McCarron pass that set up an eventual 29-yard Cody Journell field goal. On the kickoff that ensued, Jones scored his second non-offensive touchdown of the game on a 94-yard return that made the halftime score 28–10.|$|E
5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run for the only points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed {{the game with a}} long drive that ran down the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Sooners 1–3–1.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} post-war {{constituent}} assembly convened in Paris in November 1945 to draft {{the constitution of}} the French Fourth Republic, Madagascar was represented by two doctors named Joseph Raseta and Joseph Ravoahangy. They formed the Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache (MDRM) political party together with future writer Jacques Rabemananjara in early 1946. All three leaders were the descendents of Hova Merina who had been politically prominent in the former royal court. The party's platform was built on national independence from France and garnered mass support <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> across geographic, ethnic and class divisions. In November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly.|$|E

5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E
5|$|Cloud cover {{over the}} target and bad radio {{communication}} meant the B-24 formation broke up. The smaller B-24 formation lost their way and crossed into the Netherlands near Woensdrecht. After wandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they ditched their bombs. II. and IV./JG 1 took off from Woensdrecht and München-Gladbach to intercept while 5. and 6./JG 1 refuelled at Schiphol. 4./JG 1 made one pass at the bombers and two Liberators were claimed but not confirmed. 12./JG 1 intercepted over Terschelling, downing two Liberators. Of these, one {{was the result of}} a collision with a downed Fw-190 <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> the bomber's tail, 12./JG 1's only loss.|$|E
5|$|However, {{on the day}} of his arrival, the Red Army {{launched}} the Sinyavin Offensive. Originally planned as spoiling attack against Georg Lindemann's 18th Army in the narrow German salient west of Lake Ladoga, the offensive appeared able to break through the German lines, lifting the siege. Hitler, bypassing the usual chain of command, telephoned Manstein directly and ordered him to take offensive action in the area. After a series of heavy battles, he launched a counterattack on 21 September <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> off the two Soviet armies in the salient. Fighting continued throughout October. Although the Soviet offensive was fended off, the resulting attrition meant that the Wehrmacht could no longer execute a decisive assault on Leningrad, and Nordlicht was put on hold. The siege was finally lifted by the Soviet forces in January 1944.|$|E

5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged {{the landscape of the}} state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E
5|$|Needing {{to score}} quickly, Virginia Tech's {{subsequent}} drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked {{the first play}} of the drive, but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes of the drive for 46yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> California's lead to 49–42. The drive took just two minutes off the clock, leaving 4:26remaining in the game. California received the post-touchdown kickoff and went three and out, leaving {{plenty of time for}} a potential game-tying Virginia Tech drive.|$|E

5|$|Nucleases are enzymes <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides {{from the}} ends of DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{made the}} first move in the war, seizing the {{strategic}} Rochester Castle, owned by Langton but left almost unguarded by the archbishop. John was well prepared for a conflict. He had stockpiled {{money to pay for}} mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester. The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles <b>that</b> <b>cut</b> off the northern rebel barons from those in the south. John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition. John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement.|$|E
