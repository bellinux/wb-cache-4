25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the areas}} in which {{ultrasonic}} welding is most used and where new research and experimentation is centered is microcircuits. This process is ideal for microcircuits since it creates reliable bonds without introducing impurities or <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> into components. [...] Semiconductor devices, transistors and diodes are often connected by thin aluminum and gold wires using ultrasonic welding. It is also used for bonding wiring and ribbons as well as entire chips to microcircuits. [...] An example of where microcircuits are used is in medical sensors used to monitor the human heart in bypass patients.|$|E
2500|$|Early engine designs {{had a high}} {{incidence}} of sealing loss, both between the rotor and the housing and also between the various pieces making up the housing. Also, in earlier model Wankel engines, carbon particles could become trapped between the seal and the casing, jamming the engine and requiring a partial rebuild. It was common for very early Mazda engines to require rebuilding after [...] Further sealing problems arose from the uneven thermal distribution within the housings causing distortion and loss of sealing and compression. This <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> also caused uneven wear between the apex seal and the rotor housing, evident on higher mileage engines. The problem was exacerbated when the engine was stressed before reaching operating temperature. However, Mazda rotary engines solved these initial problems. Current engines have nearly 100 seal-related parts.|$|E

This paper will present {{a case study of}} an oil injected compressor tested at elevated discharge temperatures with original and revised clearances. The local <b>thermal</b> <b>distortions</b> occurring within the compressor during operation were estimated using a procedure developed by the authors - thermodynamic results from a chamber model were used to approximate component temperature distributions that are then used to predict possible <b>thermal</b> <b>distortions</b> and the resulting affect on clearance gaps.

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also side exhaust ports, the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone scraper side seal, and approached the <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics. The Renesis is capable of [...] with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 1.3L displacement. However, this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their Wankel engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the improved Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a Wankel-powered vehicle. [...] The company is continuing development of the next generation of Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R with a new rear wheel drive sports car model announced in October 2015 although with no launch date given. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. [...] Mazda announced the introduction of the series-hybrid Mazda2 EV car using a Wankel engine as a range extender, however no date of introduction has been announced.|$|E
2500|$|T-72M4 CZ: the Czech T72M4 CZ is a {{comprehensive}} upgrade of {{every aspect of the}} T-72M1 resulting in a tank that only superficially resembles the precursor. The automotive performance was enhanced with a Perkins CV12-1000 1,000hp (740kW) water-cooled diesel engine coupled to an Allison XTG-411-6 automatic transmission. All drive train work was done by the Israeli firm NIMDA and involved extensive modification of the tank's hull and the driver's compartment. The upgrade added new Czech-manufactured Dyna-72 ERA for protection against HEAT and kinetic rounds impacting the frontal aspects of the turret and hull, and against top-attack ATGMs and sub-munitions with ERA tiles covering the turret roof. Survivability is enhanced with the Polish-made Obra laser warning system integrated with a series of DGO-1 smoke grenade dischargers on each side of turret, a Deugra fire suppression system, REDA NBC suite and electromagnetic mine plow. The most important improvement in firepower comes from the use of the Galileo Avionica TURMS-T computerized FCS (it is similar to that used in C1 Ariete) which enables a [...] "hunter-killer" [...] mode of operation; the commander has a panoramic day/night sight with built-in laser rangefinder and Attila thermal camera and can engage targets independently, while the gunner has his own primary sight with thermal channel. The FCS has sensors that correct for <b>thermal</b> <b>distortion</b> of the barrel, the temperature of the ammunition propellant, meteorological conditions, totaling 22 sensor clusters installed at several points on the turret. A new 125/EPpSV-97 APFSDS round was developed for use with the new tank which can defeat 540mm of RHA at 2,000 m. The Czech tanks were also equipped with a rear-view camera, a new intercom, navigational system, the DITA 72/97B auto-diagnostic system and improvements to the suspension due to the increase in the weight of the T-72M4 CZ by 4 tonnes. Curiously, the obsolete 2A46 main gun was retained as was the original 2E28M stabilization system, which was modestly upgraded with new hydraulic drives and gyroscopic sensors, resulting in only marginal improvements in first-hit probability despite the sophisticated and expensive TURMS-T FCS. The published probability of hitting a stationary target on the move is said to be between 65-75% with the first fired round. In comparison, the Leopard 2A4 from the mid-1980s can achieve a first round hit probability on the move of 75-85% at 2,000 m and as high as 90% with a skilled crew. The original tender called for an order of 350 tanks, which was downgraded to 140 in the face of dwindling defense budgets and finally amounted to a commitment for only 35 tanks to be upgraded to the T-72M4 CZ standard. One of the reasons for this drastic reduction was due to the escalating unit cost of the upgrade—from an initial estimate of 3.7M—and closing on a final cost of US$5.2M per tank. The reliance on foreign components and labour has also taken the original Czech contractor to the verge of bankruptcy, and the program is considered a failure by analysts according to cost-effectiveness metrics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Thermal</b> <b>distortions</b> are {{regarded}} as one of major error factors in a machine tool. ISO 230 - 3 describes tests to evaluate the influence of <b>thermal</b> <b>distortions</b> caused by linear motion and spindle rotation on the tool center position (TCP). No test is described in these standards on the thermal influence of a rotary axis. Furthermore, conventional thermal tests only measure thermal influence on the positioning error at a single point, not error motions of an axis. This paper proposes a method to calibrate thermal influence on error motions of rotary axes in five-axis kinematics by the static R-test. The R-test measurement clarifies how error motions of a rotary table changes with the rotation of a swiveling axis, and how error motions are influenced by thermal changes. Experimental demonstration will be presented...|$|R

The overall impact that selection of any one of these materials has on <b>thermal</b> <b>distortions</b> is briefly discussed. As an example of how temperature dependent spatial variations in thermal strain can be accurately incorporated in the thermo-structural analysis of a precision optical system, a finite element model is developed, which is used to estimate the thermally induced distortions in the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) primary mirror. In addition to the structural analysis, the optical aberrations due to thermally induced distortions are also examined.

40|$|Over 200 graphite/aluminum and graphite/magnesium {{composites}} {{were flown}} {{on the leading}} and trailing edges of LDEF on the Advanced Composites Experiment. The performance of these composites was evaluated by performing scanning electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of exposed surfaces, optical microscopy of cross sections, and on-orbit and postflight thermal expansion measurements. Graphite/aluminum and graphite/magnesium were found to be superior to graphite/polymer matrix composites in that they are inherently resistant to atomic oxygen and are less susceptible to thermal cycling induced microcracking. The surface foils on graphite/aluminum and graphite/magnesium protect the graphite fibers from atomic oxygen and from impact damage from small micrometeoroid or space debris particles. However, the surface foils were found to be susceptible to thermal fatigue cracking arising from contamination embrittlement, surface oxidation, or stress risers.
