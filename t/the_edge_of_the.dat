5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; <b>The</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E

30|$|To {{minimize}} reobstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubal ostium after salpingostomy, everting <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fimbrial ostium {{is often}} advocated. This {{can be done}} by suturing <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ostium to <b>the</b> surrounding wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube (suturing technique) or by everting <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fimbrial ostium by heating <b>the</b> serosal surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube surrounding the ostium using electrical or laser energy (flowering technique). The suturing technique is the gold standard during laparotomy and microtubal surgery [3], while the flowering technique is utilized during operative laparoscopy as being an easier technique to learn.|$|R

5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 {{percent of the total}} ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E

40|$|We present <b>the</b> {{possibility}} <b>of</b> using a triplet as an {{intraocular lens}} (IOL).

We have also compared the size, the thickness, the power, <b>the</b> distances between <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOL and the endothelium, and <b>the</b> distances between <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IOL and the iris to the typical concave-plane lens that is usually implanted in highly myopic eyes. As we can see, when the anterior chamber depth is normal, our triplet presents a better geometrical form than the concave-plane lens...|$|R

5|$|Amanita exitialis is {{classified}} in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita.

5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia.
