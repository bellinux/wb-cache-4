5|$|In January 2009, Lovato {{first started}} writing the songs for her sophomore album Here We Go Again, right after filming {{from the first}} season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato {{explained}} about the album's process and collaborating with other songwriters and artists, such as Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. Unlike her first studio album Don't Forget, she did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as {{she wanted to see}} what her sound would be like without <b>their</b> <b>input.</b> According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly completed in just two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all of <b>their</b> <b>input</b> from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information}} in the mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E
25|$|Long {{distance}} switches may use a slower, {{more efficient}} switch-allocation algorithm than local central offices, {{because they have}} near 100% utilization of <b>their</b> <b>input</b> and output channels. Central offices have more than 90% of their channel capacity unused.|$|E

25|$|To {{transmit}} <b>their</b> <b>input,</b> typical cabled mice use a thin {{electrical cord}} terminating {{in a standard}} connector, such as RS-232C, PS/2, ADB or USB. Cordless mice instead transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth), although many such cordless interfaces are themselves connected through the aforementioned wired serial buses.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{cast the}} vote are {{different}} as well. Major League Baseball gives an unlimited number of ballots to {{each and every}} fan. The summer college league hardly has the developed fan base to pull off such a feat. Instead, the managers, league officials, and players come together to add <b>their</b> <b>input.</b>|$|E
25|$|Salt {{concentrations}} of outgoing water (either from one reservoir {{into the other}} or by subsurface drainage) are computed {{on the basis of}} salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different leaching efficiencies can be simulated by varying <b>their</b> <b>input</b> value.|$|E
50|$|Processors of dairy, {{poultry and}} eggs benefit from {{predictable}} supply from the system, while {{having to pay}} higher prices for <b>their</b> <b>inputs,</b> which can generally {{be passed on to}} the consumer. However, this means they are at a disadvantage on the international market, because <b>their</b> <b>inputs</b> are comparatively expensive. Total dairy exports in Canada amount to only 5% of production. For New Zealand by contrast, which has phased out subsidies and does not have supply management, 95% of dairy is exported.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{logic gates}} are more robust {{than others to}} a change to <b>their</b> <b>inputs.</b> Therefore, not all logic gate cards have the same {{strategic}} value.|$|R

25|$|Chinese, Japanese and Korean {{require special}} input methods, often {{abbreviated}} to CJK IMEs (Input Method Editors), {{due to the}} thousands of possible characters in these languages. Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a QWERTY keyboard, so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries. However, <b>their</b> <b>input</b> methods are considerably more complex, without one-to-one mappings between keys and characters.|$|E
25|$|One of MSUG's {{proposals}} {{with positive}} results {{was the idea}} of decentralized bureaucracy for COMIGAL. By scattering small offices throughout the villages, COMIGAL was able to improve the responsiveness of those offices; funding for infrastructure projects was generally approved by Saigon in less than two weeks. Decentralization also enabled the offices to work directly with local leaders, who as a result felt that <b>their</b> <b>input</b> and participation were important.|$|E
25|$|Once {{quantitative}} {{counts of}} each transcript are available, differential gene expression {{is measured by}} normalising, modelling, and statistically analysing the data. Most read a table of genes and read counts as <b>their</b> <b>input,</b> but some, such as cuffdiff, will accept binary alignment map format read alignments as input. The final outputs of these analyses are gene lists with associated pair-wise tests for differential expression between treatments and the probability estimates of those differences.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using {{what is called}} the kernel trick, implicitly mapping <b>their</b> <b>inputs</b> into high-dimensional feature spaces.|$|R

25|$|Distribution sort {{refers to}} any sorting {{algorithm}} where data are distributed from <b>their</b> <b>input</b> to multiple intermediate structures {{which are then}} gathered and placed on the output. For example, both bucket sort and flashsort are distribution based sorting algorithms. Distribution sorting algorithms {{can be used on}} a single processor, or they can be a distributed algorithm, where individual subsets are separately sorted on different processors, then combined. This allows external sorting of data too large to fit into a single computer's memory.|$|E
25|$|The Tomahawk was Piper's {{attempt at}} {{creating}} an affordable two-place trainer. Before designing the aircraft, Piper widely surveyed flight instructors for <b>their</b> <b>input</b> into the design. Instructors requested a more spinnable aircraft for training purposes, since other two-place trainers {{such as the}} Cessna 150 and 152 were designed to spontaneously fly out of a spin. The Tomahawk's NASA GA(W)-1 Whitcomb airfoil addresses this requirement by making specific pilot input necessary in recovering from spins, thus allowing pilots to develop proficiency in dealing with spin recovery.|$|E
25|$|Just {{northwest}} of the shipyard, Hilton Village, {{one of the first}} planned communities in the country, was built by the federal government to house shipyard workers in 1918. The planners met with the wives of shipyard workers. Based on <b>their</b> <b>input</b> 14 house plans were designed for the projected 500 English-village-style homes. After the war, in 1922, Henry Huntington acquired it from the government, and helped facilitate the sale of the homes to shipyard employees and other local residents. Three streets there were named after Post, Hopkins, and Ferguson.|$|E

50|$|ISO 13602-1 {{provides}} {{methods to}} analyse, characterize and compare technical energy systems (TES) with all <b>their</b> <b>inputs,</b> outputs and risk factors. It contains rules and {{guidelines for the}} methodology for such analyses.|$|R
25|$|Three single-degree-of-freedom {{gyroscopes}} have <b>their</b> <b>input</b> axes aligned {{along an}} orthogonal inertial coordinate system. Three signal generators, {{fixed to the}} output axis of each gyro, generated electrical signals proportional to the torque disturbances. The signals were transmitted through the servo electronics which terminated in the gimbal pivot servotorque motors. The servoloops maintained the inner gimbal rotationally fixed in inertial space. That is, while the vehicle rolled, pitched, and yawed, the inner gimbal remained in the same attitude to which it was set just before launch. Though it was being translated during the launch and orbit process, it was rotationally fixed.|$|E
25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original input function are equally spaced in <b>their</b> <b>input</b> variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz frequency spacing.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{generally}} perceived {{failures of the}} Wii U {{was a lack of}} support from third-party developers, leading to a weak library of games. Nintendo was more aggressive in trying to bring on third-party developers early in the Switch's development, to ensure a stronger lineup of games. Takahashi and Koizumi reached out to many of the third-parties directly to help gain their support early on. Electronic Arts' executive Patrick Söderlund said that Nintendo had taken a different track with attracting third-party developers to the Switch and have engaged Electronic Arts and other major developers throughout the development of the Switch, listening to <b>their</b> <b>input,</b> to help make the Switch more successful.|$|E

50|$|Typically, neurons are {{organized}} in layers. Different layers may perform {{different kinds of}} transformations on <b>their</b> <b>inputs.</b> Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.|$|R
25|$|As {{the city}} began {{crafting}} is fiscal 1939 budget, Captain Whitehurst adopted a new legislative strategy. He {{submitted to the}} City Commissioners a five-year plan laying out all transportation infrastructure requirements for the national capital, prioritizing each item. Colonel Dan L. Sultan, the Engineer Commissioner, subsequently distributed Whitehurst's strategic plan {{to a wide range}} of federal agencies, private companies (such as utilities and streetcar companies), and citizen groups, seeking <b>their</b> <b>input.</b> The top priority for bridge construction was a new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. Whitehurst proposed spending $650,000 in fiscal 1939 to survey and design the structure and begin its construction. Whitehurst's proposal received the immediate support of the Hillcrest Citizens Association, which began lobbying the District Commissioners to seek the appropriation yet again.|$|E
25|$|He {{wound down}} his career after 2003, running a best of 47.03 seconds in 2004 and 47.81 in 2006 before {{retiring}} from the sport. Following {{the end of his}} active career, he moved into sports administration. He was elected as secretary general of the Bahamas Association of Athletic Associations (BAAA) in 2012. His appointment came at a time of much political in-fighting at the organisation, between the president Mike Sands {{and other members of the}} board. Oliver found himself excluded from the 2013 CARIFTA Games organising committee, alongside fellow BAAA executives Iram Lewis and Harrison Petty. The decision to host the 2014 IAAF World Relays event was also made without <b>their</b> <b>input.</b> Oliver agreed to a vote of no confidence at a BAAA general meeting in response.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{announced}} {{yet another}} revitalization plan for Ivy City. This plan envisioned {{the purchase of}} existing but abandoned housing units, rehabilitating them, and either selling them or renting them at subsidized rates to low-income families. DCHA began purchasing distressed properties in Ivy City and offering them to developers. Developers could renovate the homes (at a profit), while DCHA would retain ownership and rent the improved property to low-income residents. To ensure that the renovated homes met the needs of existing residents, DCHA established the Ivy City Home Again Task Force, which arranged for meetings between existing DCHA tenants in Ivy City and potential developers. Residents gave <b>their</b> <b>input</b> as to which developer they preferred, opinions DCHA was bound by regulation {{to take into account}} when choosing which developer to work with.|$|E
