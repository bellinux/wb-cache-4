Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints. New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback; O'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting to <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> an altercation at the Studio 54 nightclub, at which Jets players had been present and, by some accounts, involved. The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E

Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also {{asked the court to}} require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E

5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution.

Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the Nancy Drew series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many Nancy Drew titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early Nancy Drew volumes, was called to <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
