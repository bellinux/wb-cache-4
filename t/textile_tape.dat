5000|$|Carriage {{return was}} done by a non-stretch very durable <b>textile</b> <b>tape</b> {{attached}} to the platen advance mechanism at {{the left of the}} carriage. For a return, the tape wound up on a small reel operated from the drive system through a clutch.A cam engaged the clutch; it was disengaged by the left margin stop, perhaps directly, perhaps via another cam. (Info. needed here!) A light-torque spring kept the return tape wound on the reel.The basic mechanism looks just like an IBM electric typewriter from the late 1940s. In fact, some Flexowriter parts are identical in fit and function to the early IBM electric typewriters (those with rotary carriage escapements, a gear-driven power roll, and a governor-controlled variable speed [...] "universal" [...] (wound-rotor/commutator) motor.) ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{relevant}} {{environmental impacts of}} products and processes are an essential condition in design for environment (DfE). Use processes often have a dominant influence on the environmental impacts during the whole life cycle of products. Designers are frequently overwhelmed in determining environmental impacts, due to the requirements in experience and time to carry out life cycle assessments with an appropriate accuracy. The presented Use-Phase-Analysis-Matrix (UPA-Matrix) was developed, to support the designer in a structured determination of relevant inventory data in the use phase. The structure of the UPA-Matrix {{is derived from the}} MET-Matrix and AT&T-Matrix. A rough estimation method like Eco-indicator ’ 99 is intended to process the results. The paper describes the structure and the procedure of the method. Special checklists to support the determination of inventory data in the use phase were developed. A validation of the UPA-Matrix and the accompanying checklists was carried out in project seminar on DfE of the Darmstadt University of Technology. In the paper, the method is applied on a hand drying system with a multiple used <b>textile</b> <b>tape...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{unnotched}} and notched (open hole) {{tensile strength}} and failure mechanisms of two-dimensional (2 D) triaxial braided composites were examined. The effect of notch size and notch position were investigated. Damage initiation and propagation in notched and unnotched coupons were also examined. Theory developed {{to predict the}} normal stress distribution near an open hole and failure for tape laminated composites was evaluated for its applicability to 2 D triaxial braided textile composite materials. Four different fiber architectures were considered; braid angle, yarn and braider size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and braider angle varied. Tape laminates equivalent to textile composites were also constructed for comparison. Unnotched tape equivalents were stronger than braided textiles but exhibited greater notch sensitivity. Notched <b>textiles</b> and <b>tape</b> equivalents have roughly the same strength at large notch sizes. Two common damage mechanisms were found: braider yarn cracking and near notch longitudinal yarn splitting. Cracking was found to initiate in braider yarns in unnotched and notched coupons, and propagate {{in the direction of}} the braider yarns until failure. Damage initiation stress decreased with increasing braid angle. No significant differences in prediction of near notch strain between <b>textile</b> and <b>tape</b> equivalents could be detected for small braid angle, but the correlations were weak for textiles with large braid angle. Notch strength could not be predicted using existing anisotropic theory for braided textiles due to their insensitivity to notch...|$|R
50|$|Cheadle was {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book as a small and unimportant hamlet with a small population. The town grew steadily {{over the next few}} hundred years, with the development of industry and agriculture. The historic industries that the town has depended on have been coal mining, silk, agriculture, brass making and the historic copper industry in nearby Froghall and Oakamoor. The town and the nearby village of Tean, Staffordshire also had a <b>textiles</b> industry in <b>tape</b> weaving - the mill has since been converted into flats.|$|R
50|$|Morgan R. Tsvangirai {{was born}} in the Buhera area in then Southern Rhodesia, to Karanga {{parentage}} through his father Dzingirai-Chibwe Tsvangirai and mother Lydia Tsvangirai (née Lydia Zvaipa). He is the eldest of nine children, and the son of a communal farmer, mine worker, carpenter and bricklayer. He did his primary education at St. Marks Goneso Primary School Hwedza, and transferred by his father to Chikara Primary School Gutu then he went to Silveira. He did his secondary education at Gokomere High School. After leaving school with 8 Ordinary levels, in April 1972 he landed his first job as a trainee weaver for Elastics & <b>Tapes</b> <b>textile</b> factory in Mutare. In 1974 an old school mate from Silveira encouraged Morgan to apply for an advertised job as an apprentice for Anglo America's Bindura's Nickel Mine in Mashonaland Central. He spent ten years at the mine, rising from plant operator to plant supervisor. His current rural home is Buhera, which is 220 km south east of Harare.|$|R
40|$|Live {{weight and}} linear body {{measurements}} (wither height, body length and heart girth) of 133 Ogaden cattle, maintained at Alemaya University, {{were taken from}} July 24 to July 28, 2001. Weighing was done using weighing bridge of the farm {{in the morning before}} the animals went out for grazing. A <b>textile</b> measuring <b>tape</b> was used to measure linear measurements. Most nimals were in a good condition during the measurement, possibly due to the good grass growth of the season. Age of the animals was calculated as a difference between measurement date and the recorded birth date. For those without birth date records, dentition was used to classify into four convenient age groups, which had average ages of 64. 3, 37. 2, 20. 4 and 1. 2 months for females and 38. 0, 37. 4, 20. 5 and 0. 12 months, for males, respectively. Mature females measured 280. 5 kg for body weight, 161. 4 cm for heart girth, 116. 4 cm for height at withers and 141. 0 for body length. Similarly males measured 321. 0 kg for live weight, 161. 3 cm for heart girth, 118. 0 cm for height at withers and 141. 5 cm for body length. The coat colour of this herd is uniform plain white. However, some animals have shades of black around the face, hump and rump. Hump is thoracic in location, large and prominent in both sexes, but larger in males. Most of the animals are polled, but when present, it is short and thick. The head profile is flat and the back line is straight. Lactation is not recorded from the herd, but a recent milk off-take measurement using a weigh-suckle-weigh method showed a range of 1 to 6 litres per cow per day. However, it is known that herd owners in the traditional Ogaden area mainly keep these cattle for their milk...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to make a list of selected protected trees in Prague with evaluation of their current condition by dendrometric values and their subsequent comparison to values recorded in the Central Nature Protection Registry. In 20 of the selected trees their height was measured using Nikon Laser 550 A laser rangefinder, the trunk circumference in 130 cm height was measured with a  30 m <b>textile</b> measuring <b>tape,</b> {{with the exception of}} one Platanus hispanica specimen at Karlovo Náměstí and one Taxus baccata specimen in Franciscan gardens, where the measurements were made at the heel of the tree. Health and vitality were evaluated usind indirect methods, according to guidelines described in the book by Kolářík et coll. (2010). Along with dendrometric values, species recognition and photographic documentation was made using Canon PowerShot SX 1 IS and Fujifilm FinePix JZ 100 digital cameras. The target area is located in Prague, Czech Republic. It contains following cadastral communities: Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, Smíchov, Hradčany, Liboc, Košíře. The data summary shows that the most numerous genus in the target area is Quercus (7 trees), three of which (Quercus robur) are located in Na Cibulkách urban forest, one Quercus petraea in Obora Hvězda, Quercus robur and Quercus frainetto (one of each) at Smíchov, and one Quercus robur in the Old Town. Another group are four Platanus hispanica trees, located near the Grand Priory, at Kampa, at Charles Square and in Kinský gardens. All four Fagus sylvatica trees are located in Obora Hvězda, close to a group of five Aesculus hippocastanum trees which are listed as one entity. On the slopes of Petřín, there is a Fraxinus excelsior tree belonging in Hradčany community and an Acer campestre belonging in Malá Strana community. The tallest measured protected tree is Fagus sylvatica in Obora Hvězda, the shortest is Taxus baccata near the Grand Priory. The Platanus hispanica, located near the Grand Priory as well, has the greatest measured circumference, the Taxus baccata the smallest. Most evaluated protected trees are in good health and good vitality. Measurements recorded in ÚSOP are from years 2007 to 2014...|$|R
40|$|At NASA, {{hydrogen}} {{safety is}} a key concern for space shuttle processing. Leaks of any level must be quickly recognized and addressed due to hydrogen s lower explosion limit. Chemo - chromic devices {{have been developed to}} detect hydrogen gas in several embodiments. Because hydrogen is odorless and colorless and poses an explosion hazard, there is an emerging need for sensors to quickly and accurately detect low levels of leaking hydrogen in fuel cells and other advanced energy- generating systems in which hydrogen is used as fuel. The device incorporates a chemo - chromic pigment into a base polymer. The article can reversibly or irreversibly change color upon exposure to hydrogen. The irreversible pigment changes color from a light beige to a dark gray. The sensitivity of the pigment can be tailored to its application by altering its exposure to gas through the incorporation of one or more additives or polymer matrix. Furthermore, through the incorporation of insulating additives, the chemochromic sensor can operate at cryogenic temperatures as low as 78 K. A chemochromic detector of this type can be manufactured into any feasible polymer part including injection molded plastic parts, fiber-spun <b>textiles,</b> or extruded <b>tapes.</b> The detectors are simple, inexpensive, portable, and do not require an external power source. The chemochromic detectors were installed and removed easily at the KSC launch pad without need for special expertise. These detectors may require an external monitor such as the human eye, camera, or electronic detector; however, they could be left in place, unmonitored, and examined later for color change to determine whether there had been exposure to hydrogen. In one type of envisioned application, chemochromic detectors would be fabricated as outer layers (e. g., casings or coatings) on high-pressure hydrogen storage tanks and other components of hydrogen-handling systems to provide visible indications of hydrogen leaks caused by fatigue failures or other failures in those systems. In another type of envisioned application, chemochromic detectors of this type could be optoelectronically instrumented for monitoring to provide measured digital indications of color changes indicative of the presence of hydrogen...|$|R
