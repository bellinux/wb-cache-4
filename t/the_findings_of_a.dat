5|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2012 Cochrane systematic review {{does not justify}} the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E

Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} depart from <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2005 study, which pegged {{the mean age}} of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E
25|$|This {{drive to}} earlier {{diagnosis}} has also manifested {{itself on the}} European continent {{by the use of}} serum calcitonin measurements in patients with goiter to identify patients with early abnormalities of the parafollicular or calcitonin-producing cells within the thyroid gland. As multiple studies have demonstrated, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elevated serum calcitonin is associated with <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medullary thyroid carcinoma in as high as 20% of cases.|$|R

5|$|In March 1971, the NTSB {{released}} a report summarizing <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> study of midair collisions. The report indicated that 204 of 396 fatalities in U.S. jetliner crashes since 1967 had occurred in mid-air collisions. Additionally, near-miss situations involving jetliners occurred on average at least once per day, with the Los Angeles and New York areas noted as being especially high-risk. Finally, the report noted that the current trend in air casualties indicated that a further 528 people would die in mid-air collisions during the following ten years. These figures {{did not include the}} casualties from Flight 706.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} had {{originally intended to}} try both defendants together; however, the trial of Bobby Cherry was delayed due to <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which had concluded that vascular dementia had impaired his mind, therefore making Cherry mentally incompetent to stand trial or assist in his own defense.|$|E
25|$|While the {{available}} evidence is weak, tentative results suggest that frequent ejaculation may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.

However, the ejaculation frequency was not associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer. The results were broadly similar to <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller Australian study and an American study.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Israeli {{government}} supported {{upgrading the}} college to university status.

25|$|According to {{an initial}} report on <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1998 DNA study which tested the Y-chromosome of direct male-line {{descendants}} of Eston Hemings, {{and other related}} tests, {{there is a high}} probability that Thomas Jefferson was the biological father of Eston Hemings, with a nearly perfect match between the DNA of Jefferson's paternal uncle and the descendants of Eston Hemings. These initial claims were later relativised by the lead researcher in the case, acknowledging that the DNA was compatible with the paternity of some of Jefferson's relatives.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Devlin arrived in Nyasaland, Armitage {{received}} advice from the Colonial Office on the action to be followed when a governor dissented from <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Commission of Inquiry, {{and was told that}} he could dissent if he felt it was justified. At the end of May, Armitage thought the commission were satisfied that the State of Emergency was necessary, but that it did not accept that there was a massacre plan, and had concentrated on the use of firearms and the burning of houses by government forces, ignoring events leading up to such incidents. He suspected that the Commission's report would be highly critical.|$|E
25|$|In a 1994 poll by The Washington Post, 9% of the {{respondents}} {{said that it was}} possible that astronauts did not go to the Moon and another 5% were unsure. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 6% of the Americans surveyed doubted that the Moon landings happened and that 5% of those surveyed had no opinion, which roughly matches <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar 1995 Time/CNN poll. Officials of the Fox network said that such skepticism rose to about 20% after the February 2001 airing of their network's television special, Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?, seen by about 15 million viewers. This Fox special is seen as having promoted the hoax claims.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{study by}} {{consultants}} Woodward-Clyde for Environment Bay of Plenty, Environment Waikato, the Taupo District Council and Tranz Rail Limited were published {{to evaluate the}} various proposals to deal with transporting forestry products out of the Taupo region. The report stated that railheads could be accessed at Waiouru, National Park, Kinleith, and Murupara. The report {{said that it would}} be unlikely that rail connections would be made at National Park or Waiouru as the distance to forestry ports and processing plants would increase. A connection from Kinleith was a possibility but it would need to traverse difficult terrain and two crossings of the Waikato River may be needed. The report recommended an extension of the Murupara Branch line as being the best rail option.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005 it was {{discovered}} that civil servants of the Immigration & Naturalisation Services had informed the Congolese embassy and authorities that several of the people sent back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. The Congo had long been struggling with civil war. This information is considered confidential and should not have been disclosed to the Congolese authorities. Verdonk at first denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted that she had lied. In several cases, the Congolese embassy had been informed that several returnees had applied for asylum in the Netherlands. According to members of the opposition, this information could put returnees (in this case to Congo) at risk of torture or other oppression, but no party or organization provided documentation for the claim. Verdonk maintains that no other sensitive information was given to the Congolese authorities, in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> special committee (Commissie Havermans).|$|E
25|$|Former Texas Governor James E. Ferguson, who was {{forbidden}} by {{the articles of}} impeachment from holding office, put his homemaker wife Miriam A.

Cunningham served as chair of the Texas League of Women Voters (TLWV) Committee on Prison Reform. She was {{also a member of the}} Texas Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor (CPPL), hoping to reform the Texas practice of incarcerating prisoners as cotton plantation labor. In 1925, CPPL's Elizabeth Speer named Cunningham to chair a committee to present <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor to the state legislature. Governor Miriam Ferguson vetoed the CPPL's recommendation of taking the prisoners off the plantations and housing them in a new facility to be built in Austin.|$|E
