25|$|NBC's <b>Tonight</b> <b>was</b> {{the late-night}} {{counterpart}} to its early-morning show Today. Originating in 1953 with host Steve Allen, <b>Tonight</b> <b>was</b> somewhat experimental at the time, {{as the only}} previous network late-night program was NBC's Broadway Open House which starred Jerry Lester and Dagmar. <b>Tonight</b> <b>was</b> successful, and when Allen moved on to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1956, Jack Paar replaced him as host of Tonight.

25|$|Today <b>Tonight</b> <b>is</b> {{notorious for}} its sensationalist reporting, {{and is an}} example of tabloid {{television}} where stories rotate around community issues i.e. diet fads, miracle cures, welfare cheats, shonky builders, negligent doctors, poorly run businesses and corrupt government officials. For this reason the program is constantly ridiculed and criticised, perhaps most famously by ABC TV's Media Watch and the satirical group The Chaser. The show has also been found multiple times to be in breach of the Australian Communications and Media Authority's policies with regard to invasions of privacy and not presenting factual material accurately.|$|E

How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren.

The show opens with a topical monologue, then transitions into a comedic desk piece, guest interviews/sketches/games, and concludes with a musical performance. More than anything, Pitt Tonight has impacted the university’s utilization of multimedia since its 2015 premiere, and in addition, moments from the series have gone viral, including its challenge of Jimmy Fallon to speed-eat a Primanti Brothers’ sandwich. The show has been nominated for two Mid-Atlantic Emmy Awards, and won one College Broadcasters Inc. award for Best General Entertainment Program.|$|E

500|$|Davis slumped {{a bit in}} 2009 spring {{training}} but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers' manager Ron Washington said, [...] "I'm not worried about Chris. Chris works hard. He had a little spell where {{he was trying to}} get himself together.

[...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees.

500|$|<b>Tonight</b> <b>is</b> {{a concept}} album that explores the {{highs and lows}} {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox. [...] "This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after", writes the reviewer. The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music. It has been inspired by the [...] "heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars" [...] and has [...] "the heavy bass and space echo you would find on a dub mix." [...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same {{no matter what we}} do, but there are other influences there. I guess the drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through." ...|$|E

500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club issued the episode a B+ grade, {{and felt that}} the episode was superior {{to those of the}} show's first season. He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'. There's every indication that it's on the way there in the premiere because it's finally started to wrestle with some of the knottier questions at its center." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, <b>tonight</b> <b>is</b> a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance <b>tonight</b> <b>is</b> funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E

2500|$|Voters {{were split}} {{as to who}} won the first presidential debate. Bush {{improved}} in the second debate. Before the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and {{spent much of the}} day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being intellectually cold. Reporter Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered; Dukakis's answer discussed the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Several commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue, but many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of a person asked about a loved one's rape and death. Tom Brokaw of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast, [...] "The consensus <b>tonight</b> <b>is</b> that Vice President George Bush won last night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night." ...|$|E
