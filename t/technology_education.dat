40|$|<b>Education</b> <b>Technology</b> Leadership {{is known}} to be a key element in the {{successful}} use of <b>technology</b> in <b>education.</b> The evaluation of <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership is often aided by the use of <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> standards for administrators. While <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership is often associated as primarily the role of school administrators, <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership also emerges from other sources; for example, teachers, technology coordinators, parents, students, and community members. Collaborative leadership theory provides a theoretical basis for the premise that <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership may be effectively distributed across an organization. There is support in the literature indicating school administrators have been successful in achieving sustainable change through the use of collaborative leadership techniques. Often <b>education</b> <b>technology,</b> under the direction of a effective <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership, is used as a change agent in school improvement initiatives.;The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an assessment of <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership. With the assistance of an expert panel, a survey titled the <b>Education</b> <b>Technology</b> Leadership Assessment (ETLA) was created. The ETLA was intended to be a general purpose <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership assessment. It was similar to the Principal Technology Leadership Assessment (PTLA) survey (Center for the Advanced Study of Leadership in Education, 2005). Where the PTLA was based on ISTE National <b>Education</b> <b>Technology</b> Standards for Administrators (NETS-A), the ETLA was based on the ISTE Technology Leadership (TL) Standards.;The data analysis results of this study produced evidence of ETLA item reliability and validity. In addition, the EFA process generated six factors and helped to identify inter-relationships between those factors and the TL Standards used to provide the original framework for the ETLA. These findings indicated that the ETLA had potential as a useful assessment of <b>education</b> <b>technology</b> leadership. This study 2 ̆ 7 s findings were limited by the use of one sample population. A recommendation for future research is to continue to evaluate ETLA reliability, validity, and data inter-relationships as additional data sets are collected...|$|R
