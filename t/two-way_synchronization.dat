30|$|Through {{comparison}} with ground station, we can realize {{the measurement of}} clock offset, and in current aerospace application, the time reference is established on the ground. But such measurement has several shortcomings: short measurement time, low measurement precision, and others limitations resulting from short visual time between the ground station and satellite. Moreover, once the ground station is damaged, that measurement of clock offset cannot be conducted. After establishing inter-satellite link for the measurement of clock offset directly in the inter-satellite, we can obtain high-precision system time reference, get high-precision inter-satellite clock offset, and use the suitable algorithm processing. The satellite-ground <b>two-way</b> time <b>synchronization</b> {{is one of the}} methods to measure the high-precision clock offset between the satellite and ground station [10 – 12]. It can improve the measurement precision of clock offset because it can offset the influence of additional delay at atmospheric layer, as well as the time delay between the satellite and ground station. However, the satellite and ground are required to stay in a relative rest state when we use this method; otherwise, the inconsistent two-way time delay caused by the satellite motion will affect the accuracy. This paper used satellite-ground <b>two-way</b> time <b>synchronization</b> method for autonomous measurement of inter-satellite clock offset, and analyzed the specific influence of satellite motion on the measurement. Taking the satellite motion into consideration, this paper deduced the correction method of inter-satellite two-way clock offset measurement, and the correctness of the method was verified via satellite tool kit (STK) simulation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Distributed {{transmit}} beamforming {{has recently}} been proposed as a technique in which several single-antenna sources cooperate to form a virtual antenna array and simultaneously transmit with phase-aligned carriers such that the passband signals coherently combine at an intended destination. The power gains of distributed transmit beamforming can provide increased range, rate, energy efficiency, and/or security, as well as reduce interference. Distributed transmit beamforming, however, typically requires precise synchronization between the sources with timing errors {{on the order of}} picoseconds. In this paper, a new <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol is developed to facilitate precise source synchronization and retrodirective distributed transmit beamforming. The <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol is developed under the assumption that all processing at each source node is performed with local observations in local time. An analysis of the statistical properties of the phase and frequency estimation errors in the <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol and the resulting power gain of a distributed transmit beamformer using this protocol is provided. Numerical examples are also presented characterizing the performance of distributed transmit beamforming in a system using two-way source synchronization. The numerical results demonstrate that near-ideal beamforming performance can be achieved with low synchronization overhead. I...|$|E

30|$|Same {{with the}} satellite-ground <b>two-way</b> time <b>synchronization,</b> {{we take the}} {{different}} deviation occurs at each simulation experimental result during the simulation period of inter-satellite two-way clock offset measurement for the influence of satellite motion direction and Sagnac effect on the correction method out of consideration [14]. The satellite motion directions {{at the same time}} length and different time period as well as different time length and different time period are different when simulating and calculating the clock offset data, and the influence on the clock offset fit polynomial error is also different. Especially, the deviation between the clock offset after the correction and actual clock offset is the maximum when the time period for clock offset measurement is asymmetric compared with the moment at the inter-satellite distance change rate of 0. At the actual application of the correction method, the simulation influence on the correction method is reduced for the influence of satellite motion direction and Sagnac effect on the algorithm is contained in the measuring value of T 1 and T 2 [15]. If the high-precision time difference measuring method is used for the moving satellite and the data processing method with higher fitting precision is used, the precision of correction method can be improved further, and the actual clock offset measurement precision will be higher than the result obtained from the simulation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, three clock-synchronization {{algorithms}} for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) under unknown delay are derived. They {{include the}} maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), a generalization of the estimator of Noh et al., and a novel lowcomplexity estimator. Their corresponding performance bounds are derived and compared, and complexities are also analyzed. It is found that the MLE achieves the best performance {{with the price of}} high complexity. For the generalized version of the estimator of Noh et al., although it has low complexity, its performance is degraded with respect to the MLE. On the other hand, the newly proposed estimator achieves the same performance as the MLE, and the complexity is at the same level as that of the generalized version of the estimator of Noh et al.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a fundamental theory of secure clock synchronization. Accurate clock synchronization is {{the backbone of}} systems managing power distribution, financial transactions, telecommunication operations, database services, etc. Some clock synchronization (time transfer) systems, such as the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), are based on one-way communication from a master to a slave clock. Others, such as the Network Transport Protocol (NTP), and the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP), involve two-way communication between the master and slave. This paper shows that all one-way time transfer protocols are vulnerable to replay attacks that can potentially compromise timing information. A set of conditions for secure two-way clock synchronization is proposed and proved to be necessary and sufficient. It is shown that IEEE 1588 PTP, although a <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol, is not compliant with these conditions, and is therefore insecure. Requirements for secure IEEE 1588 PTP are proposed, and a second example protocol is offered to illustrate the range of compliant systems. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure, submitted for revie...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} optimal signal coverage, GNSS satellites have to experience orbital maneuvers. For China&# 39;s COMPASS system, precise orbit determination (POD) as well as rapid orbit recovery after maneuvers contribute to the overall Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) service performance in terms of accuracy and availability. However, strong statistical correlations between clock offsets and the radial component of a satellite&# 39;s positions require long data arcs for POD to converge. We propose here a new strategy which relies on time synchronization between ground tracking stations and in-orbit satellites. By fixing satellite clock offsets measured by the satellite station <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> (SSTS) systems and receiver clock offsets, POD and orbital recovery performance can be improved significantly. Using the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) as orbital accuracy evaluation, we find the 4 -hr recovered orbit achieves about 0. 71 m residual root mean square (RMS) error of fit SLR data, the recovery time is improved from 24 -hr to 4 -hr compared with the conventional POD without time synchronization support. In addition, SLR evaluation shows that for 1 -hr prediction, about 1. 47 m accuracy is achieved with the new proposed POD strategy. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract—Coordinated multicell {{downlink}} transmission {{has recently}} been proposed as a technique that can enable spectrally efficient communication in cellular networks. By coordinating downlink transmissions, the base stations in a cellular system can transmit such that signals from multiple base stations arrive coherently at a mobile. One approach to coordinated multicell downlink transmission {{is to have the}} mobiles estimate the down-link channel state information (CSI) and feed the CSI back to the base stations for precoding. This paper proposes a different approach based on retrodirectivity and channel reciprocity. The primary advantage of this approach {{is that there is no}} need for CSI estimation or feedback by the mobiles. A tradeoff, however, is that the base stations must be synchronized to within a small fraction of a carrier period. A new two-way base station synchro-nization protocol is proposed to facilitate coordinated multicell coherent retrodirective downlink transmission techniques. An analysis of the statistical properties of the estimation errors in the <b>two-way</b> <b>synchronization</b> protocol and the resulting power gain of a multicell retrodirective downlink beamformer using this protocol is provided. Numerical examples are also presented char-acterizing the performance of multicell retrodirective downlink beamforming in a system using two-way base station synchroniza-tion.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} <b>two-way</b> time <b>synchronization</b> system {{is described in}} this paper. The system uses one voice channel at a SCPC satellite digital communication earth station, whose bandwidth is only 45 kHz, thus saving satellite resources greatly. The system is composed of one master station and one or several, up to sixty-two, secondary stations. The master and secondary stations are equipped with the same equipment, including a set of timing equipment, a synthetic data terminal for time synchronizing, and a interface unit between the data terminal and the satellite earth station. The synthetic data terminal for time synchronization also has an IRIG-B code generator and a translator. The data terminal of master station is the key part of whole system. The system synchronization process is full automatic, which {{is controlled by the}} master station. Employing an autoscanning technique and conversational mode, the system accomplishes the following tasks: linking up liaison with each secondary station in turn, establishing a coarse time synchronization, calibrating date (years, months, days) and time of day (hours, minutes, seconds), precisely measuring the time difference between local station and the opposite station, exchanging measurement data, statistically processing the data, rejecting error terms, printing the data, calculating the clock difference and correcting the phase, thus realizing real-time synchronization from one point to multiple points.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new <b>two-way</b> time <b>synchronization</b> (TS) method for {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -based wireless systems. It {{relies on the}} time-reversal (TR) technique to remove {{the effect of the}} channel phase after the signal round-trip. Thus, the method is named TR-TS. TR technique yields a linear phase rotation across subcarriers, regardless whether the channel is minimum, maximum, or mixed phase. This phase is proportional to the difference of the OFDM symbol-timing synchronization errors at the two receivers. Thus, the clock-offset between the radios is determined using the local reception times and the estimated linear phase resulting from the TR technique. A reliable low-complexity algorithm called fast Fourier transform-weighted least-squares is proposed to estimate the linear phase slope, and its meansquare error is compared with the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). The results show that the proposed algorithm attains the CRLB at low SNR, even when a single OFDM symbol is used. The OFDM packets are time-stamped at the medium access control layer, which allows eliminating errors caused by different and varying delays in the internal lower level processing of the data. Hence, an accurate estimate of the clock-offset is obtained. The impact of various nonidealities on the proposed algorithm is also studied. In addition, we propose a ranging method that employs the novel TS method and a first-path delay estimation technique. The performance of the proposed methods is studied in simulations, as well as using real-world measured channels. The results show that the proposed methods can be successfully applied in low to moderate mobility scenarios such as indoors despite harsh multipath, since they rely on channel reciprocity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Time-based {{localization}} approaches {{attract a}} lot of interest due to their high accuracy and potentially low cost for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, time-based local-ization is tightly coupled with clock synchronization. Thus, the reliability of timestamps in time-based localization becomes an important yet challenging task to deal with. In this paper, we propose robust time-based localization strategies to locate a target node with the help of anchors (nodes with known positions) in asynchronous networks. Two kinds of asynchronous networks are considered: one only with clock offsets, labeled quasi-synchronous networks, whereas the other with not only clock offsets but also clock skews, labeled fully asynchronous networks. A novel ranging protocol is developed for both networks, namely asymmetric trip ranging (ATR), to reduce the communication load and explore the broadcast property of WSNs. Regardless of the reliability of the timestamp report from the target node, closed-form least-squares (LS) estimators are derived to accurately estimate the target node position. As a result, we counter the uncertainties caused by the target node by ignoring the timestamps from this node. Further-more, in order to simplify the estimator in fully asynchronous networks, localization and synchronization are decoupled. A simple yet efficient method is proposed to first Calibrate the Clock Skews of the anchors, and then Estimate the Node Position (CCS-ENP). Finally, Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) and simulation results corroborate the efficiency of our localization schemes.
