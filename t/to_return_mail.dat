40|$|How {{confident}} {{can we be}} {{that the}} comparatively low response rates associated with mail surveys of groups of political activists, such as participants of a demonstration, does not hide a substantial nonresponse bias? The paper compares {{the results of a}} face-to-face survey of 2003 anti-Iraq war demonstrators in Glasgow, achieving a near perfect response rate, with the data derived from a mail survey handed out to demonstrators eliciting valid responses from 37 % of marchers. The comparison shows that better educated, older, female demonstrators were more likely <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the <b>mail</b> questionnaire. Also demonstrators having born a higher 'cost' of travelling to the demonstration are more likely to respond. There was no evidence that political interest or political orientation played an important role. However, those who had taken part in demonstrations very frequently in recent years were less likely <b>to</b> <b>return</b> the <b>mail</b> questionnaire. While these results provide some reassurance that even with response rates below 40 %, no substantive political bias is present, researchers undertaking surveys of activists should be alerted to the need to address possible nonresponse biases in a systematic way...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abortion {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{surgical}} procedures performed on women in the United States, and its safety has been demonstrated. Little research has focused, however, on women 2 ̆ 7 s reports and ratings of the service. OBJECTIVES: This study explored the association of demographic factors, medical outcomes, and client ratings of service dimensions with global satisfaction. RESEARCH DESIGN: For this cross-sectional study, permission to access clinic medical records was obtained. Surveys were distributed after the procedure, with instructions <b>to</b> <b>return</b> by <b>mail.</b> SUBJECTS: Study subjects were 797 women who underwent an outpatient surgical abortion at 1 of 2 New England health centers in 1996 and 1997. MEASURES: Demographic data, pregnancy history, and information on the procedure were collected from medical records. Survey items measured reports of access, medical outcomes, and satisfaction ratings with service domains. RESULTS: Women with positive ratings of staff sensitivity and of the counseling process and information received and those who had the procedure at a younger gestational age were less likely to report that care could be better. Although very few women reported a medical complication, this was associated with agreement that care could have been better, as was reporting agreement that the wait between the preexamination visit and the procedure was too long. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with abortion services is high. Education and counseling play very important roles. Survey items could routinely be used to monitor services...|$|R
