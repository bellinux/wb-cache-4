If they did escape, it is likely that they will be taking some trouble to find out what became of us. They may have seen their companion’s fate, but they would hardly have made us out in the darkness. Still, they would certainly want to report our loss, and may sail along close inshore to look for timbers and other signs of wreck. I think, therefore, that it will be advisable to station a well-armed boat at this end of the cut, and tell them to row every half-hour or so to the other end and see if they can make out either sailing or rowing craft coming along the shore. If they do see them they must retire to this end of the opening, unless they can find some place where they could hide till a boat came abreast of them, and then pounce out and capture it.” ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{states that}} his {{findings}} show no systematic {{relationship between the}} amount of money spent in an American school and the amount of student learning in a given district, and therefore he generally opposes increases in school funding to achieve overall reductions in class size, for example. For this reason he is associated, especially by his detractors, with the slogan [...] "money doesn't matter". Hanushek explains his position this way:The discussion whether school resources are systematically related to school quality and to school achievement has tended toward a battle of slogans “Money matters” or “Money doesn’t matter.” ... It is tautological to say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> good performance if we spend the money wisely. Today the existing knowledge base does not ensure that any added funds will, on average, be spent wisely. That is true even if some schools may spend their funds wisely.
