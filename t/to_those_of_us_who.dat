His continuing interest in Canada and his support and friendliness towards our scientists at meetings is a good reason for Canadians to remember him. <b>To</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> met him later in his career it was apparent that he showed the fearlessness of a fighter, regardless of the odds against him whenever it seemed important to state his opinion on controversial scientific, professional or political problems. As a distinguished alumnus he was constantly in touch with Queens University and participated in the scientific program held during the 100th anniversary of the Queen's University Medical School.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews referred to the book as [...] "an enlightening cautionary take" [...] and [...] "a charmingly personal account", but also as [...] "loosely organized and occasionally sparse on detail". John Wilkes, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Although naive and overdrawn at times, this heartfelt tale will bring tears and smiles {{to even the most}} stubbornly objective reader." [...] Donna Mitchell, writing in The Wilson Bulletin (now The Wilson Journal of Ornithology), wrote that Houle's interpretation of the falcons' behavior is excessively [...] "anthropomorphic", but also that [...] "Ms. Houle's perseverance and dedication to the protection of the Peregrine Falcon is admirable and an incentive not only to young biologists just getting started but <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> get a little more than discouraged with the struggle to protect endangered species and their habitats." ...|$|E

The 1942 Casablanca centers on the development of conscience in the cynical American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in the face of oppression by the Nazis and the example of the resistance leader Victor Laszlo.The David Lean and Robert Bolt screenplay for Doctor Zhivago (an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel) focuses strongly on the conscience of a doctor-poet {{in the midst of the}} Russian Revolution (in the end [...] "the walls of his heart were like paper").The 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner focuses on the struggles of conscience between and within a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)) and a renegade replicant android (Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)) in a future society which refuses to accept that forms of artificial intelligence can have aspects of being such as conscience.|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E

An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. <b>To</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> have followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{observers}} were more cautious.

[...] Gibson compared the savagery in the film to the Bush administration, telling British film magazine Hotdog, [...] "The fear-mongering we depict in the film reminds me of President Bush and his guys." [...] Just prior to its release, Apocalypto was criticized by activists in Guatemala, including Lucio Yaxon, who charged that the trailer depicts Maya as savages. In her review of the film, anthropologist Traci Ardren wrote that Apocalypto was biased because [...] "no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities". Apocalypto also sparked a strong condemnation from art history professor Julia Guernsey, a Mesoamerican specialist, who said, [...] "I think it's despicable. It's offensive to Maya people.

2500|$|On August 18, 2013, David Miranda, {{partner of}} {{journalist}} Glenn Greenwald, was detained for nine hours under Schedule 7 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act of 2000.

Greenwald described Miranda's detention as [...] "clearly intended {{to send a message}} of intimidation <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ". The Metropolitan Police and Home Secretary Theresa May called Miranda's detention [...] "legally and procedurally sound". However, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, who helped introduce the bill in the House of Lords, said that under the act, police can only detain someone [...] "to assess whether they are involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism." [...] He said, [...] "I am very clear that this does not apply, either on its terms or in its spirit, to Mr Miranda." [...] Antonio Patriota the Brazilian Minister of External Relations said that Miranda's detention was [...] "not justifiable". The reasons for Miranda's detention were sought from the police by British politicians and David Anderson Q.C., the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The United States government later said that British officials had given them a [...] "heads up" [...] about Miranda's detention, while adding that the decision to detain him had been a British one.|$|E

2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
