40|$|<b>Visual</b> {{information}} modulates <b>the</b> balance response {{evoked by}} a pure vestibular perturbation (galvanic vestibular stimulation, GVS). Here we investigate two competing hypotheses underlying this visual–vestibular interaction. One hypothesis assumes vision acts in a feedforward manner by altering {{the weight of}} the vestibular channel of balance control. The other assumes vision acts in a feedback manner through shifts in the retinal image produced by the primary response. In the first experiment we demonstrate a phenomenon that is predicted by both hypotheses: the GVS-evoked balance response becomes progressively smaller as <b>the</b> amount of <b>visual</b> self-motion information is increased. In the second experiment we independently vary the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus <b>visual</b> <b>environments.</b> <b>The</b> rationale is that feedback effects would depend only upon <b>the</b> post-stimulus <b>visual</b> <b>environment.</b> Although <b>the</b> post-stimulus <b>visual</b> <b>environment</b> did affect later parts of the response (after ∼ 400 ms), <b>the</b> pre-stimulus <b>visual</b> <b>environment</b> had a strong influence {{on the size of the}} early part of the response. We conclude that both feedforward and feedback mechanisms act in concert to modulate the GVS-evoked response. We suggest this dual interaction that we observe between visual and vestibular channels is likely to apply to all sensory channels that contribute to balance control...|$|R
