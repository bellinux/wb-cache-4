The first national championship win was in 1991 with the varsity heavyweight fours with coxswain.|$|E
5|$|In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen {{down to a}} Vallejo Ace Hardware store, {{where he}} is {{employed}} as a sales clerk. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a brief encounter before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, victim Mike Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. As the authorities walk by an airport book store, copies of Graysmith's book Zodiac are shown. Final title cards inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further. A DNA test performed in 2002 on an archived autopsy sample did not match a partial DNA sample gathered from the postage stamp {{on one of the}} Zodiac letters, but this does not rule him out as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. One of them has been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> {{their own}} horses close at hand, and soon all {{were in the}} saddle, with the extra horses {{bringing}} up the rear, as before. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> rations with them, and offered Tom some crackers {{and a bit of}} meat as they progressed.|$|R

25|$|The men's {{program is}} coached by Bubba Thornton {{who was also}} the men's US Olympic coach in 2008; as a team, the Longhorn men placed fourth in the 2008 NCAA outdoor championships. Other notable coaches of the Texas men's program have {{included}} Stan Huntsman (Texas coach, 1986–95), who was also {{the coach of the}} 1988 US Olympic team, and Clyde Littlefield (Texas coach, 1920–60), the 1925 co-founder of the annual Texas Relays. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> won four consecutive Big 12 Indoor Championships.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary theory {{predicts that}} males would be apt to seek more mating {{partners}} than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits {{from such a}} strategy. Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies {{that allow them to}} acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners. Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one female’s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and women because <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a longer reproductive window.|$|E

25|$|He {{not only}} {{supplied}} {{the men with}} necessities, but even with luxuries and cash to spend. The operative's extreme liberality endeared him to the men, who rewarded him by electing him president of the union. We now see the unique spectacle of a Pinkerton spy, under the direct orders of Manager McParland, as president of a Western Federation of Miners' local union, and directing a bitter strike against the smelter trust. On his elevation to the presidency the operative did not relinquish {{his position on the}} relief committee, nor would <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> permitted him to do so, as they were perfectly satisfied with the way the operative squandered the money of the Federation...|$|E
25|$|The North Jamtish {{clothing}} part {{is typically}} {{influenced by the}} folk costumes of northern Ångermanland {{and to a lesser}} degree Lapland, with the exception of Frostviken parish settled by Trønders in the 18th century. The East Jamtish part is the least old-fashioned of the three with many changes done to the costumes through time, making them closer to the kind used at the Swedish coast, rather than the others in Jämtland. The Great Jamtish part has typically old-fashioned and conservative homogeneous bunads with blue socks, red knitted caps among the males, dark bounded caps for ladies and coloured for girls. The skirts are usually of a single colour and <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> blue or black hodden coats, with yellow chamois leather pants made from moose skin.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Bedouin {{society was}} nomadic, pastoral, and {{agricultural}} based. Within this system, labor was divided along gender lines. Women were traditionally {{in charge of}} the agricultural activities, which included herding, grazing, fetching water, and raising crops, while men were in charge of guarding their land and receiving visitors. Bedouin culture, especially as it relates to gender norms, developed around this economic structure. In accordance with these traditional economic roles, women in Bedouin society did not interact with strangers, especially unfamiliar men. Bedouin men mediated most of the interactions their families have with the larger society. As such, Bedouin culture became highly patriarchal. Within this traditional system, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> held most of the power, but the vital economic roles of the women granted them significant degree of influence over the household decision-making.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda, {{economic}} development has lagged behind other parts of Querétaro and Mexico, in part to the end of mining in neighboring municipalities and in part to the ruggedness of the region's terrain. From the last decades of the 20th century to the present, the economic marginalization of the area has given the municipality one of the highest rates of emigration. Most migrants go to the United States, and the money they send back has now become the major income for Landa and {{the rest of}} the Sierra Gorda. However, the migration is dangerous. In March and April 2010, seventeen residents of the municipality disappeared while en route to the United States. Most are believed to have been kidnapped by armed men while their bus was in the state of Tamaulipas, taken to work in fields growing drugs. As of March 2011, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> yet to be found, although four men were arrested in connection with the incident, for threatening the families of the victims. The incident has provoked the municipal government to advise residents not to go the United States, especially not through routes controlled by drug traffickers.|$|E
500|$|When Mary's lion {{is finally}} {{killed at the}} book's halfway mark, the local shamba [...] (village) gathers for a ngoma (dance). Because she has dysentery, Mary leaves for Nairobi to see a doctor; while she is gone Ernest kills a leopard, after which <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a {{protracted}} ngoma. When Mary returns from Nairobi, she asks Ernest for an airborne sightseeing tour of the Congo Basin as a Christmas present.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> {{their names}} below the busts on the obverse, and wear hats of their period. They gaze toward the legend IN GOD WE TRUST, {{the only one}} of the {{national}} mottos usually present on U.S. coins to appear. The name of the country arcs above their heads, while HUGUENOT HALF DOLLAR is below them. Morgan's initial [...] "M" [...] is on Coligny's shoulder. The reverse depicts the ship Nieuw Nederlandt and the words, HUGUENOT – WALLOON – TERCENTENARY – FOUNDING OF NEW NETHERLAND with the years 1624 and 1924 to either side of the ship. Stoudt's sketch for the reverse was also used on the one cent denomination of the stamp set issued in conjunction with the tercentenary.|$|E

500|$|A large {{audience}} gathers {{to watch}} them get up and cook. There is a violent storm. They reach Pushal, [...] "the capital of the Ramgul Kafirs". The headman gives them delicious apricots and tells tales of the old days. They admire the antique rifles of many kinds that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have,</b> all [...] "in a disgraceful condition". A mullah forbids {{them to go to}} a funeral where a bullock is to be slaughtered, in a holiday atmosphere. Instead, they sit under a walnut tree beside a river, with kingfishers, butterflies, hummingbird hawkmoths, a woodpecker drilling, and have [...] "a rare moment of peace". Newby shakes hands with two lepers. They all have dysentery. Newby spends hours negotiating the price of a complete male Nuristanis costume.|$|E

Numerous schools, churches and other landmarks in Mexico take their name from the battalion, including: ...|$|E

2500|$|Arabia [...] was {{originally}} part of Persia. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> high noses, are dark, and bearded. The women are very fair [...] {{and when they}} go out they veil the face. Five times daily they worship God [...] They wear silver girdles, with silver knives suspended. They do not drink wine, nor use music. Their place of worship will accommodate several hundreds of people. Every seventh day the king (Caliph) sits on high, and speaks to those below saying, ' Those who are killed by the enemy will be born in heaven above; those who slay the enemy will receive happiness.' Therefore they are usually valiant fighters. Their land is sandy and stony, not fit for cultivation; so they hunt and eat flesh.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{speaks to}} Jacques {{and his wife}} and discovers that before Gustave, there was another waiter, called Robert, who was {{dismissed}} for incompetence but who was not witnessed leaving the hotel. That night, the three card-playing men attack Poirot in his room, but he is saved by the pistol-carrying Schwartz. The three men are locked up and Schwartz tells Poirot that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> already 'carved up' Gustave's face. Schwartz and Poirot find Dr Lutz attending the not too seriously injured detective, and then follow a bloody trail down the carpets of the hotel to an unused wing where they find a dead body with a note pinned to it which reads [...] "Marrascaud will kill no more, nor will he rob his friends." [...] Poirot uses a heliograph to signal down the mountain for help and three days later, Lementeuil and some officers arrive after climbing up to the hotel.|$|E
