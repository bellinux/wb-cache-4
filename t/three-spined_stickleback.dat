40|$|The <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> is an {{adaptable}} {{fish with}} variation in morphology and behaviour, inhabiting saltwater, brackish water and fresh water. It is armoured with 30 - 35 bone plates along its lateral line. In addition, it {{is equipped with}} three spines on its back and two pelvic spine. These features constitute an excellent anti-predator defence system. Yet, {{there is a strong}} selection for reduction in armour of <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> in freshwater stickleback. In this project, the bone structure and lateral plate of 72 <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> from salt, brackish and fresh water was compared. Three-dimensional description of bone structures was accomplished by the use of micro-computed tomography (µ-CT).

25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, smoothhound and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback,</b> nine-spined stickleback and common minnow.

Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown trout (sea trout: Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific salmon. In the case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within {{the first week of}} infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full life cycle on the <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

50|$|The garfish is a {{predator}} which hunts {{in the open}} sea seeking out shoals of small fish such as Atlantic herring, sprats, sand eels and even <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> They also feed on free-swimming crustaceans.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to decreasing dissolved oxygen {{level in the}} environment, fish swim {{up to the surface}} of the water column and ventilate at the top layer of the water where it contains relatively higher level of dissolved oxygen, a behavior called aquatic surface respiration (ASR). Oxygen diffuses into water from air and therefore the top layer of water in contact with air contains more oxygen. This is true only in stagnant water; in running water all layers are mixed together and oxygen levels are the same throughout the water column. One environment where ASR often takes place is tidepools, particularly at night. Separation from the sea at low tide means that water is not renewed, fish crowding within the pool means that oxygen is quickly depleted, and absence of light at night means that there is no photosynthesis to replenish the oxygen. Examples of tidepool species that perform ASR include the tidepool sculpin, Oligocottus maculosus, the <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback,</b> and the mummichog.|$|E
25|$|In a 1996 biotic {{assessment}} of upper Searsville Lake {{and the lower}} floodplain of Corte Madera Creek, Stanford biologists wrote that the native species likely included coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), sculpin, California roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), hitch (Lavinia exilcauda), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus), and perhaps <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidontus), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). They noted that the only native species observed with any regularity {{in the study area}} are Sacramento sucker and rainbow trout, and attributed the now depauperate native fish fauna to dislocation of hydrologic connectivity due to the dam, transformation of the habitat above the dam from lotic to lentic, and the fact that Searsville Reservoir harbors many non-native species of centrarchid fishes (sunfish, black bass, and crappie) which prey on virtually all historically native fishes. They noted that federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) occur in the lotic portions of Corte Madera Creek below the dam but not above, likely due to depredation by non-native fish and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus).|$|E
25|$|The river below Clayton West {{ceases to}} be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and {{consists}} of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of industrial effluent, and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to oxygenate the water, {{and most of the}} fish had been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback,</b> which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a restocking programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies of {{closely related}} species with {{different}} sex chromosome systems can provide insights into the processes of sex chromosome differentiation and evolution. To investigate the potential utility of molecular markers in studying sex chromosome differentiation at early stages of their divergence, we examined the levels and patterns of genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in nine-spined (Pungitius pungitius) and <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using microsatellite markers. Results A set of novel microsatellite markers spanning {{the entire length of}} the sex chromosomes were developed for nine-spined sticklebacks using the sequenced genomes of other fish species. Sex-specific patterns of genetic variability and male-specific alleles were identified at most of these loci, indicating a high degree of differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes in nine-spined <b>sticklebacks.</b> In <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks,</b> male-specific alleles were detected at some loci confined to two chromosomal regions. In addition, male-specific null alleles were identified at several other loci, implying the absence of Y chromosomal alleles at these loci. Overall, male-specific alleles and null alleles were found over a region spanning 81 % of the sex chromosomes in <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> Conclusions High levels but distinct patterns of sex chromosome differentiation were uncovered in the stickleback species that diverged 13 million years ago. Our results suggest that the Y chromosome is highly degenerate in <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks,</b> but not in nine-spined sticklebacks. In general, the results demonstrate that microsatellites can be useful in identifying the degree and patterns of sex chromosome differentiation in species at initial stages of sex chromosome evolution. </p...|$|R

40|$|Receiver-bias {{models of}} signal {{evolution}} predict that male sexually selected traits evolve through prior selection for other functions. Female <b>three-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in many populations show a mating preference for males {{with a red}} throat and jaw. It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females {{in accordance with the}} Fisher-Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female <b>three-spined</b> and nine-spined <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context.

2500|$|After {{the broader}} {{definition}} of social immunity by Cotter and Kilner, numerous examples of social immune behaviours within animal families can be given: túngara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus) create 'foam nests' during breeding in which embryogenesis occurs; these foam nests are imbued with ranaspumin proteins which provide defence against microbial attack {{and act as}} a detergent. The <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus), grass goby (Zosterisessor ophiocephalus), fringed darter (Etheostoma crossopterum) and two species of blenny also use chemical strategies to defend their eggs from microbes. [...] Intriguingly, microbes themselves {{have been found to}} have social immune systems: when a population of Staphylococcus aureus is infected with gentamicin, some individuals (called small colony variants) begin to respire anaerobically, lowering the pH of the environment and thus conferring [...] resistance to the antibiotic to all other individuals-including those S. aureus individuals who did not switch phenotype. An analogy can be drawn here with the social fever in bees described above: a subset of individuals in a population change their behaviour and in doing so provide population-wide resistance.|$|E

40|$|We sampled three limnetic fish species: {{juvenile}} {{sockeye salmon}} (Oncorhynchus nerka), <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in Lake Washington to quantify species-specific patterns of diel vertical migration (DVM). Catch-per-unit-effort data analysed from 15 years of midwater trawling documented seasonal and diel differences in vertical distributions for each species. These results {{were consistent with}} the hypothesis that the patterns of DVM in Lake Washington were affected by life history, size and morphology. Sockeye salmon showed clear DVM in spring but essentially no DVM in fall, remaining in deep water, whereas <b>three-spine</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> were prevalent at the surface at night in both seasons. In fall, distribution patterns may be explained by differences in thermal performance (e. g., sticklebacks favouring warm water), but the patterns were also consistent with inter-specific differences in predation risk. Younger sockeye salmon and longfin smelt were present in greater proportions higher in the water column during dusk and night periods than older conspecifics. Compared with sockeye salmon, the greater use by <b>three-spine</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> of surface waters throughout the diel cycle during weak thermal stratification in spring was consistent with the hypothesis that sticklebacks’ armour reduces predation risk, but use of this warmer, metabolically beneficial stratum may also have promoted growth.
