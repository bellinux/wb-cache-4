5000|$|Tosylchloramide or [...] N-chloro tosylamide, sodium salt, sold as chloramine-T, is a N-chlorinated and N-deprotonated sulfonamide {{used as a}} biocide and a mild disinfectant. It is a {{white powder}} that gives {{unstable}} solutions with water. Trade names of chloramine-T products include Chloraseptin, Chlorazol, Clorina, Disifin, Halamid, Hydroclonazone, Trichlorol, Minachlor, and generic Chloramin T or <b>Tosylchloramide</b> <b>Sodium,</b> among others.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{treatments}} include formalin, malachite green, methylene blue, chelated copper, copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, quinine and <b>tosylchloramide</b> <b>sodium.</b> There {{are also}} {{a large number of}} proprietary treatments available for the treatment of white spot, and the related Oodinium (velvet disease). Chemical treatment is only effective against free-swimming juvenile parasites tomites. All treatments target the free-living theronts and tomonts, which only survive about two to three days {{in the absence of a}} host fish.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{antiseptic}} aqueous solutions {{intended for}} the disinfection of living tissues were compared in regard to their microbicidal effectiveness towards. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Six antiseptics, which contain boric acid, eosine, hydrogen peroxide or an organic mercury compound as the active substance, did not fulfil {{the requirements of the}} preliminary in vitro test. The seven other preparations were examined in a practical test, in which bactericidal activity was assessed on artificially contaminated intact skin after exposures of 15 s and 60 s. The most active solution appeared to be 0. 5 % <b>tosylchloramide</b> <b>sodium,</b> followed by 0. 05 % chlorhexidine with 0. 5 % cetrimide. The other preparations, namely 0. 05 % chlorhexidine without cetrimide, 0. 245 % chloroxylenol, 0. 04 % clorofene, 10 % povidone-iodine and 0. 2 % <b>tosylchloramide</b> <b>sodium,</b> were less active in this practical teststatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Toll-like receptors are a {{group of}} glycoproteins located mostly in {{cellular}} membranes, capable of recognizing certain molecules in exogenous microorganisms and initiating immune responses against them through the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. Toll-like receptors can be stimulated when an inflammatory reaction is needed {{for the treatment of}} conditions, such as viral infections or skin cancer, or can be inhibited when a reduction of inflammation is necessary for the treatment of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and septic shock. In the human skin, keratinocytes and Langerhans cells are known to express these receptors. Skin conditions where Toll-like receptors are known to be upregulated include acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, syphilis, leprosy, Staphylococcus aureus infections, candidiasis, and herpes simplex and varicella zoster infections. Besides imiquimod, which is the most successful and more studied topical Toll-like receptor-modulating agent to date, other topical agents, such as nicotinamide, all-trans retinoic acid, adapalene, zinc, and <b>sodium</b> <b>tosylchloramide,</b> have also been found to exert some of their action through Toll-like receptors. Recent topical agents, including CBT-SL 5 and CpG-ODN, are being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory acne and skin cancer, respectively, and have demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of those conditions...|$|R
40|$|For chronic {{wounds to}} become {{primarily}} healing wounds, {{not only the}} appropriate surgical procedure - especially wound debridement - but also {{the treatment of the}} causative basic disease must be taken into consideration. In both the prophylaxis of wound infections and the treatment of existing wound infections, wound antiseptics play a crucial role. As long as a clinically manifest infection is confined to the wound and has not spread hematogenically, the indication for application of wound antiseptics is given. Should systemic involvement exist, antimicrobial chemotherapy is additionally required. Antiseptics must only be used following careful determination of indication. Impaired wound healing can otherwise result. For chronically poorly healing wounds and burns, polihexanide is the agent of first choice. However, based on new in-vitro findings, octenidine dihydrochloride is superior to polihexanide in terms of therapeutic spectrum. These findings enable a broader application of octenidine dihydrochloride to include use on chronic wounds at lower concentrations than usual. The following agents must be viewed critically in terms of their use as wound antiseptics: chlorhexidine, 8 -chinolinol, nitrofural, phenol derivates, quats, silver nitrate, silver sulphadiazine, <b>tosylchloramide</b> <b>sodium,</b> triclosan, and hydrogen peroxide. As wound antiseptics, dyes and organic mercury compounds are obsolete...|$|E
