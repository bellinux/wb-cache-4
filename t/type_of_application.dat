5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex.|$|E

HotStart enables what Microsoft has referred to as appliance-like availability, allowing a PC to take on a number of roles based on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> launched—a PC that boots into a multimedia application, for example, can essentially function as a dedicated media device. Original equipment manufacturers can customize HotStart hardware implementation and functionality. Users may also customize application launch functionality through the Windows Registry; instead of launching a multimedia application, a user can, for example, configure a HotStart button or other form of input to instantly launch an e-mail application.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{subgroup}} {{of a free}} group is free. This result is quite interesting, because the statement is purely algebraic yet the simplest known proof is topological. Namely, any free group G may be realized as the fundamental group of a graph X. The main theorem on covering spaces tells us that every subgroup H of G is the fundamental group of some covering space Y of X; but every such Y is again a graph. Therefore, its fundamental group H is free. On the other hand, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> is also handled more simply {{by the use of}} covering morphisms of groupoids, and that technique has yielded subgroup theorems not yet proved by methods of algebraic topology. (See the book by Higgins listed under groupoids.) ...|$|E
2500|$|If a {{clock is}} sent in {{parallel}} with data, that clock {{can be used to}} sample the data. [...] Because the clock must be received and amplified before it can drive the flip-flops which sample the data, there will be a finite, and process-, temperature-, and voltage-dependent delay between the detected clock edge and the received data window. [...] This delay limits the frequency at which data can be sent. [...] One way of eliminating this delay is to include a deskew PLL on the receive side, so that the clock at each data flip-flop is phase-matched to the received clock. In that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> a special form of a PLL called a delay-locked loop (DLL) is frequently used.|$|E
2500|$|Tuning - The {{balance of}} these effects is {{achieved}} by [...] "loop tuning" [...] (see later) to produce the optimal control function. The tuning constants are shown below as [...] "K" [...] and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself. Approximate values of constants can usually be initially entered knowing the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> but they are normally refined, or tuned, by [...] "bumping" [...] the process in practice by such as introducing a setpoint change and observing the system response.|$|E

At this time, there are no toolkits capable <b>of</b> developing both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> through authoring a single generic application interface. So we propose a visualized toolkit within an integrated development environment and discuss the design issues.
