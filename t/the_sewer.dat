5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer. Stevens {{and a group}} of women walk through <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades down the streets as men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to <b>the</b> <b>sewer.</b> Throughout the video, sequences of Stevens {{and a group of}} backup dancers performing in <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> are shown.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of <b>the</b> <b>sewer.</b> As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliamentary}} clerk {{continued to}} live alongside the tower, except during the interregnum of 1649 and 1660, when the House of Lords was temporarily abolished. <b>The</b> <b>sewer</b> feeding into the moat was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E

5|$|The State of Washington {{operates}} a public government administration office in Omak {{for access to}} social and health assistance. Omak {{is considered to be}} a code city, based on proposals to provide the local government with more authority from its previous second-class city status. With a functional court for traffic, parking and civil infractions, the city maintains <b>the</b> <b>sewer,</b> water, local road, sidewalk, street lighting, animal control, building inspection, park, and recreation services.

5|$|The city generates 5,34,760kg of {{domestic}} solid wastes everyday, while per capita {{generation of waste}} is 0.40kg per day. <b>The</b> <b>sewer</b> service areas are divided into nine zones in the city. Allahabad Municipal Corporation oversees the solid waste management project. Allahabad was the first city to get pre-paid meters for electricity bill in Uttar Pradesh. The city is equipped with over 40 CCTVs at major crossings and markets.Also Allahabad was declared as a smart city in the year 2015 and the funds were provided by the United States of America.|$|E

The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, who lives in <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E

5|$|With USNS Card {{a regular}} {{visitor to the}} port, it became a target for local Viet Cong {{commando}} units. Shortly after midnight on May 2, 1964, two Viet Cong commandos climbed out of <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> tunnel near the area where Card was anchored, and they attached two loads of explosives to the ship’s hull. The attack was a success and Card sank , and five civilian crew members {{were killed by the}} explosions. The ship was refloated 17 days later, and was towed to the Philippines for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he preferred a horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E
500|$|The {{high-level}} sewer—the most northern of the works—ran from Hampstead Heath to Stoke Newington {{and across}} Victoria Park, where it {{joined with the}} eastern end of <b>the</b> mid-level <b>sewer.</b> <b>The</b> mid-level <b>sewer</b> began in <b>the</b> west at Bayswater and ran along Oxford Street, through Clerkenwell and Bethnal Green, before the connection. This combined main <b>sewer</b> ran to <b>the</b> Abbey Mills Pumping Station in Stratford, where it was joined by {{the eastern end of}} <b>the</b> low-level <b>sewer.</b> <b>The</b> pumps at Abbey Mills lifted the effluent from <b>the</b> low-level <b>sewer</b> [...] into <b>the</b> main <b>sewer.</b> This main sewer ran —along what is now known as the Greenway—to the outfall at Beckton.|$|R
