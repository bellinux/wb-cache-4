5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> put her to bed.|$|E

One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, [...] "What's happening?" [...] Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together, then told Edwards to accompany him to <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> pose for nude pictures.

2500|$|In more mixed reviews, The A.V. Club critic Steven Hyden {{wrote that}} while Era Extraña sounds [...] "fuller" [...] than Psychic Chasms and [...] "still {{has plenty of}} hooks to offer", Palomo [...] "has to take both feet out of <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>to</b> move his music forward". He also {{compared}} it to another chillwave album that was released a few months before, Washed Out's Within And Without, saying that [...] "Where Within is an immaculately conceived graduation from [...] Greene's early lo-fi work, Extraña is a minor refinement that still feels chintzy in places". Beck and Robertson also discussed Washed Out, as well as Toro y Moi, dubbing the album an unfunny parody of chillwave and also criticized it as [...] "such a strong homage to everything that's cool about retro-chic that you can't help but smell a rat". At PopMatters, Wisnicki wrote that Era Extraña {{did not have the}} same quality tunes and aesthetic that Psychic Chasms had, declaring that while each song on Psychic Chasms [...] "felt like getting to open another piece of candy", Era Extraña [...] "feels more like opening one of those refrigerated boxed sandwiches from the grocery store".|$|E
