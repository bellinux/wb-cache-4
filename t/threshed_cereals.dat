The frictional impact that occurs between the crop surface and threshing cylinder has been often neglected by most researchers in <b>cereal</b> <b>threshing.</b> Approach: Study proffers {{a solution to this}} issue by developing a model for threshing which in-cooperate friction. This was done by analyzing the crop/threshing cylinder behavior, hence establishing mathematical sub-models to characterize the performance of this model. Results: The model was further packaged with computer aided software based on visual basic programming language and finally applied. Conclusion: Upon application, it was discovered that at a moisture content of 15 % v = 9 m sec - 1, Q = 0. 18 kg sec - 1 the model yielded performance characteristics as Eff = 88. 22 %, TNL = 11. 78 % and CAPTH = 211. 52 kg h - 1...|$|R
40|$|In the Ryukyu Islands it {{is clear}} that cereal {{cultivation}} had begun by the Gusuku Period (12 - 15 th centuries AD). In this paper, I examine the beginning of cereal cultivation based upon archaeological materials. Prior to the Gusuku period, the cereal remains obtained from three sites (Nazakibaru, Yajagama and Nagarabaru-Higashi) are rice, wheat, barley and beans. All of these were discovered in a carbonized state, a condition that is often produced by the process of <b>threshing.</b> These <b>cereals</b> thus tell us that cultivation had already began {{at the end of the}} first millennium in the Ryukyu Islands. In addition, these cereals are thought to be derived from dry field cultivation and it is very important that this type of cultivation was connected directly with that of the Ryukyu Dynasty...|$|R
5000|$|A Canaanean blade is {{an archaeological}} {{term for a}} long, wide blade made out of stone or flint, {{predominantly}} found at sites in Israel and Lebanon (ancient Canaan). They were first manufactured and used in the Neolithic Stone Age {{to be used as}} weapons such as javelins or arrowheads. The same technology was used during the later Chalcolithic period in the production of broad sickle blade elements for harvesting of crops. Canaanean blades were also used in the <b>threshing</b> of <b>cereal</b> grains. This indicates the presence of early agricultural technologies. The blades would be attached to a small wooden platform with bitumen. The platform, with a human or other weight standing on it, was then pulled behind an animal across a threshing floor. The forward motion of the animal paired with the downward force of weight exerted through the blades served to cut grain into small pieces.|$|R

50|$|In 1826 in Scotland, the {{inventor}} Reverend Patrick Bell designed (but did not patent) a reaper machine, which used the scissors principle of plant cutting - a principle {{that is still}} used today. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, <b>threshing</b> and winnowing <b>cereal</b> grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2 m (17 ft), cut width of 4.57 m (15 ft) and by 1839, over 50 acre of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms. Australian Hugh Victor McKay produced a commercially successful combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Harvester.|$|R

To achieve this, equations were derived which describe the threshing rate, threshing loss, grain damage, efficiency and threshing capacity. The equations were used to simulate and optimize the threshing performance of the model. The model was validated with published threshing performance data and it was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values equal to or greater than 0. 9 which is highly significant (α= 0. 000). The developed model enables optimal parameters to be selected for a design in which the objective function (grain damage or losses) is minimized. At 16 % moisture level, minimal loss is 3. 6792 % and efficiency of 92. 32 % while the performance characteristics are v = 9 m/s, Q = 0. 12 kg/s, c = 0. 015 m...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- To {{achieve a}} {{productive}} model, the operation processes {{need to be}} modeled, the model have to be properly packaged and the results thereafter should be compared and verified with other conventional models to prove validity. This forms {{the structure of the}} <b>cereal</b> <b>thresher</b> model developed. To achieve this, the processes were modeled mathematically using the various thresher and crop parameters (velocity of cylinder, crop feed rate, concave clearance, crop flow rate etc) and in-cooperating the frictional factor. After which the submodels that characterizes performance was hence developed. The model was packaged using computer aided software based on VISUAL BASIC programming language. Using the model, the performance of the thresher was simulated and hence optimized based on minimum threshing loss. At 15 % moisture level, the minimal loss is 11. 78 %, capacity is 211. 52 kg/h and unthreshed grain flow rate of 0. 021 kg/s while other performance characteristics are 18 m/s, 0. 18 kg/s, 0. 02 m. On validation with published data of past researchers, the model was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values which is highly significant at 0. 001...|$|R
40|$|Iron intakes {{calculated}} from one-day weighed records {{were compared with}} those from same day analyzed duplicate diet composites collected from 120 Malawian women living in two rural districts with contrasting soil mineralogy and where <b>threshing</b> may contaminate <b>cereals</b> with soil iron. Soils and diet composites from the two districts were then subjected to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion and iron availability in the digests measured using a Caco- 2 cell model. Median analyzed iron intakes (mg/d) were higher (p < 0. 001) than calculated intakes in both Zombwe (16. 6 vs. 10. 1 mg/d) and Mikalango (29. 6 vs. 19. 1 mg/d), attributed to some soil contaminant iron based on high Al and Ti concentrations in diet composites. A small portion of iron in acidic soil from Zombwe, but not Mikalango calcareous soil, was bioavailable, as it induced ferritin expression in the cells, and {{may have contributed to}} higher plasma ferritin and total body iron for the Zombwe women reported earlier, despite lower iron intakes. In conclusion, iron intakes {{calculated from}} food composition data were underestimated, highlighting the importance of analyzing duplicate diet composites where extraneous contaminant iron from soil is likely. Acidic contaminant soil may make a small but useful contribution to iron nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Emmer-wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon) was the {{dominant}} crop cultivated in ancient Egypt, but was gradually replaced by hard-wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) during the Ptolemaic period (later the Roman period). Hard-wheat was {{in contrast to}} emmer-wheat a free-threshing <b>cereal.</b> <b>Threshing</b> hard-wheat resulted in large numbers of threshing remains. This provided the opportunity to use threshing remains, among others, as temper in the fabrication of mud-bricks in construction. However, archaeobotanical research of threshing remains (rachis fragments in particular) in mud-bricks from Roman Karanis showed {{that they were not}} directly used in the production of bricks. Instead, after threshing the material was treated a second time, what resulted in higher expenses and extra time. 	This is an interesting observation {{in the study of the}} dynamics of the agricultural economy in the town of Karanis. This thesis focusses upon the economic use of threshing remains in Roman Karanis. The following text will explore the link between the available threshing remains on the one hand and their use as temper in the production of mud-bricks on the other hand. The aim of this research is to reconstruct the logistic of the construction of houses in Karanis. Central to this study are several questions: How many threshing remains were on average needed for the production of a single brick? Which processes were applied to the material before adding them as temper in mud-bricks and why?...|$|R

Their research {{is based on a}} database with more than 4600 records. Wild food plants in the Dogon country are explored by C. Selleger in a study which shows that these plants could be considered as a mainstay of agricultural society in sub-Saharan Africa, enabling continuity of the agricultural system. C. Griffin-Kremer gives the example of silverweed as a plant that may have been on its way from a ‘wild’ plant gathered knowledgeably to a ‘tended’ one in a garden plot. The paper draws attention to the potential of wild plant resources used in the past for food and abandoned in recent times. The chapter ends with the contribution of L. Scott Cummings, who presents palynological evidence on the use of Cleome (beeweed) in North America, not only as a famine food resource when cultivated plants become too scarce to sustain human needs, but also as a complement to maize consumption. In Chapter 6, C. Griffin-Kremer recalls the multiplicity of non-human food uses of plants, whether as fodder, for their medicinal or intoxicating properties, for crafting everyday life objects, as well as for clothing (flax, hemp), dyes, for industrial goals, such as fuel, ropes, fishing nets or buildings, or as sentinels to prevent plagues or intoxications. In the first contribution illustrating the versatility of plant uses, Griffin-Kremer emphasises the diversity of uses of furze (Ulex spp.) in both rural and urban contexts as fuel, for livestock production or for crafting domestic artefacts. In the same way nettles (Urtica spp.) were valued as much as a medicinal, as fodder, and as a textile fibre. Like furze, it had associations with ritual and, beyond that, with saintliness. L. Peña-Chocarro and L. Zapata survey the uses of hulled wheats (Triticum monococcum L., T. dicoccum L. and T. spelta L.) in Mediterranean mountain areas. These species, highly resistant to disease, provide both food and fodder, as well as a rich variety of domestic uses. E. Bonnaire takes the example of by-products produced during <b>threshing</b> of various <b>cereals</b> that have been used as temper in ceramics, mud walls, or mud bricks, thus helping to elucidate the entire sequence of cereal processing. P. Anderson’s contribution deals with diss (Ampelodesmos mauritanica (Poir.) T. Durand and Schinz), a grass used in Tunisia in basketry, as fodder for animals, roof thatching and even as a snack for children when the stems are young. Bui Thi Maï et al. present the possible ancient uses of the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.), and compare it with recent ethnological inquiries carried out in a Sardinian community. In particular, this contribution presents the uses of the oil from its berries, its action as a pesticide and medicine from its leaves, and most especially, the mastic or sap from its trunk used in medicines, cosmetics and foods as preservatives. In the final contribution, Bui Thi Maï and M. Girard launch onto the trail of the oleoresins produced by two Dipterocarpaceae trees in Vietnam, most particularly for boat caulking. They observed present-day practices in their ethnographic inquiries and discuss the pertinent literature about modern round-boats, as well as the remains and techniques implied by the palynological analysis of the late fifteenth-century Brunei wreck. In Chapter 7, A. -M. Hansson and A. G. Heiss do not attempt to embrace all the uses of plants in ritual and festive contexts, but focus mainly on plant offerings as an expression of rituals performed with regard to supernatural forces, aimed at winning their support for agricultural yields (fertility rites), protection for {{the living and the dead}} (propitiatory rites) or thanking them for all they provide (thanksgiving rites). Indeed, the material components of plant offerings allow researchers to trace these practices with a broad range of methods, and across a large timescale. A. -M. Hansson explores a stone bun offering from an early medieval cremation grave at Lovö in Sweden, and concludes it may imply a protection rite based on traditional oral sources from Northern Europe and from other similar findings elsewhere in Europe. A. G. Heiss investigates plant offerings as agricultural fertility rites in the Alpine region, ranging from the Alpes-de-Haute- Provence in France to Styria in Austria, that are found from the Copper Age to the Roman Iron Age. Initially focused on meat from domesticated animal offerings, studies now show that food plants are as important as the zoological remains. Botanical remains show that burnt offerings reflect an important part of daily nutrition, with a common and constant representation of cereals and a clear dominance of cultivated crops. C. Griffin-Kremer presents plant use in propitiatory rituals performed up to the 20 th century at various times, including the eleven days eliminated when Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, and in particular May Day and Maying celebrations. Centred around the British Isles, but with quick incursions into other European countries that hold such May festivals, Griffin- Kremer provides a panorama of plants used and their role as prophylactic, medicinal, decorative or devotional for this one “holiday”. L. Scott-Cummings provides examples of documented ceremonial and ritual plant use by a native group in the American southwest, the Hopi, for fertility, propitiatory and thanksgiving rites. She presents the different plants used for specific festivals and rituals that enliven the Hopi calendar year. M. Sayre focuses on the use of ceremonial plants in the Andes at the site of Chavín de Huántar, located in central Perú, dated 1000 – 200 BCE. In particular, he uses both iconographic sources from the site itself and botanical remains to address the variety of psychoactive plants in South American ceremonial sites. Finally, Chapter 8 addresses the issues of social status, identity, and the social as well as the physical contexts that shape and drive the food plant choices made by humans. The chapter points out that no one is really free to choose, but that food plant selection is shaped by a whole set of cognitive and symbolic associations rooted in cultural and social settings that create an entire taxonomy of plants that people are allowed to eat. Thus, the contributions in this chapter illustrate the tight relationship between social norms, beliefs and values, linked to social status, identity and context, on the one hand, with plant choices, on the other hand. A. Chevalier shows that the Peruvian site of Pampa Chica, dated between 800 / 400 and 150 BCE presents duplicated spaces that may have been used by two groups with different social status within an egalitarian pre-Columbian society. The different plant remains point toward the affirmation of each group’s identity based on their respective mythical origins. In this case, social status does not refer to social or economic power, in other words, to social hierarchy, but is related to social and cultural identity through mythical origin and kinship. In the opposite case, S. González, focusing on plant representation in the Iron Age Iberian world between the 6 th and the 2 nd century BCE, shows that Iberian elites used plant images to justify their political and economical power: wild elites as, in other contexts and periods, would be the case of wild animals such as the lion and the mythical unicorn. Exploring social status in the oppidum of Bibracte, France, between the end of the first century BCE to 14 CE, A. Durand and J. Wiethold demonstrate that the diet of the elites of one of the richest and most powerful Gaulish tribes, the Aedui, does not seem to be based only on luxury food plants, even if it does include Roman plants such as olives and coriander. Instead, diversity and the presence of huge quantities of gathered wild fruits seem more indicative of high social status markers among the Aedui. W. Kirleis and S. Klooß show the same, but for Northern Germany in the Neolithic Funnel Beaker Culture, ranging from 4100 to 2800 BCE: wild plants in association with inhumations would indicate high social status. Moreover, social and physical contexts would define what kind of plants are allowed or prohibited: for the living world of farmers, the presence of wild plants is discrete, whereas in the world of the after-life, wild plants seem to be of particular importance. In contrast, G. Cruz-García shows that wild plant consumption is related to low social status in the Wayanad district of the Western Ghats of India. Wild plants, as opposed to the case of the Iberians and the Gauls, are often seen as symbols of poverty and ‘tribalness’. Their gathering and consumption tend to be hidden to outsiders of the group, due to the social stigma that is currently associated with using wild plants for food. J. L. Mingote Calderόn demonstrates that the choice of plants is highly codified and restricted according to one’s social status in Spain, from the Middle Ages through the 19 th century: local ordinances obliged farmers to cultivate only certain plants, and punishments or fines were imposed on them if they did not comply with rules set by the elites. Finally, D. J. Goldstein and J. B. Hageman, in their study of a Maya site, link plant choices not only to social class, but also to the context of use: their work focuses on the social codes used to actively establish and maintain social hierarchy, as expressed by two residential units within a Late Classic (CE 600 – 900) Mayan lineage at the site of Guijarral, Belize. Archaeobotanical remains associated with periodic feasting near ancestor shrines were distinct from daily domestic activities near house mounds. They come to the conclusion that the consumption of specific foods in specific places created and reinforced in-group social inequality during the Late Classic. After four years of meeting and intense discussion in the framework of the EARTH scientific program, this book attempts to explore plant diversity and choice through time by looking at a variety of related topics involved in the study of plant use. According to the authors’ fieldwork, initial training and experience, the individual contributions are based on very different theoretical backgrounds. The diversity of the viewpoints, as well as of the human cultures, regions and periods considered, constitutes the strength and the interest of the present publication. The book does not claim to provide a state-of-the-art of the topics addressed, nor to be all-comprehensive. It is in no way an encyclopaedia on plants and their uses through time and across geographic location, but it does attempt to provide new insights and a useful framework for approaching past and modern plant choice and diversity of use. and an exuberant fantasised nature are attributes of thenrpages: 432 status: publishe...|$|R
