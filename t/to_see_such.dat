Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E

25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
25|$|The Colonial Route {{is mostly}} in the central {{highlands}} with {{a significant number of}} churches, monasteries and other structures from the colonial period along with some from the 19th century and even into the early 20th. The most important city on this route is San Cristóbal de las Casas, located in the Los Altos region in the Jovel Valley. The historic center of the city is filled with tiled roofs, patios with flowers, balconies, Baroque facades along with Neoclassical and Moorish designs. It is centered on a main plaza surrounded by the cathedral, the municipal palace, the Portales commercial area and the San Nicolás church. In addition, it has museums dedicated to the state’s indigenous cultures, one to amber and one to jade, both of which have been mined in the state. Other attractions along this route include Comitán de Domínguez and Chiapa de Corzo, along with small indigenous communities such as San Juan Chamula. The state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the area's most famous natural attraction of the Sumidero Canyon. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the Grijalva River <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and plant formation on the side of one of the canyon walls created by a seasonal waterfall.|$|E

500|$|On March 6, 1943, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} the U.S. II Corps by the German Afrika Korps, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, Patton replaced Major General Lloyd Fredendall as Commanding General of the II Corps and was promoted to lieutenant general. Soon thereafter, he had Major General Omar Bradley reassigned to his corps as its deputy commander. With orders to take the battered and demoralized formation into action in 10 days' time, Patton immediately introduced sweeping changes, ordering all soldiers to wear clean, pressed and complete uniforms, establishing rigorous schedules, and requiring strict adherence to military protocol. He continuously moved throughout the command talking with men, seeking to shape them into effective soldiers. He pushed them hard, and sought to reward them well for their accomplishments. His uncompromising leadership style is evidenced by his orders for an attack on a hill position near Gafsa which are reported to have ended [...] "I expect <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince me that a serious effort has been made to capture this objective." ...|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Neil, son of General Tire's founder William O'Neil and {{chairman}} of the broadcasting group, saw that the company's new television stations, indeed all TV outlets, were in need of programming. They sought to acquire the RKO library, but Hughes would not sell to General Tire unless they purchased the studio outright. With the purchase of RKO, the studio's library was his, and rights to the 742 films to which RKO retained clear title were quickly put up for sale. C Television Corp., a subsidiary of beverage maker Cantrell & Cochrane, won the bidding in December 1955. It was soon offering the films to independent stations in a package called [...] "MovieTime USA". RKO Teleradio Pictures—the new company created from the merger of General Teleradio and the RKO studio—retained the broadcast rights for the cities where it owned TV stations. By 1956, RKO's classic movies were playing widely on television, allowing many <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> films as Citizen Kane for the first time. The $15.2 million RKO made on the deal convinced the other major studios that their libraries held profit potential—a turning point in the way Hollywood did business.|$|E
500|$|Following {{two days}} of deliberation, Campbell {{announced}} that he had suspended Richard– who was leading the NHL's overall scoring race at the time– {{for the remainder of the}} regular season and the playoffs. In English Canada, Campbell was praised for doing what he could to control the erratic Richard. Unknown to most at the time, Campbell had long wanted to impose a lengthy suspension on Richard over his previous outbursts. [...] As NHL president however, Campbell ultimately answered to the league's owners and they were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> severe discipline imposed against one of the league's star players on account of their value in increasing game attendance. In French Quebec the suspension was viewed as an injustice, an unfair punishment given to a Francophone hero by the Anglophone establishment. [...] Richard's supporters reacted angrily to Campbell: he received several death threats and, upon taking his customary seat at the next Canadiens game, unruly fans pelted him with vegetables, eggs and other debris. One fan threw a tear gas bomb at Campbell, which resulted in the Forum's evacuation and the game's forfeiture in Detroit's favour. Fans fleeing the arena were met by a large group of demonstrators who had massed outside prior to the game's start.|$|E

The developers also stated that they were not worried about the fact that Sega's previous Alien game, , received a negative public reaction. According to Napper, [...] "It did completely reaffirm to us that there was a massive Alien fanbase out there [...] just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a vocal reaction to the game, everything that they've said they want is something that we're building and we're very excited about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Children's comics such as The Rover, The Hotspur, Schoolgirls' Own, The Magnet and Adventure usually {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} adventure stories, presented as text rather than strip cartoons, and some British boys were buying American horror comics produced for G.I.s. Morris {{was impressed by the}} high standard of artwork in the US magazines, but disgusted by their content, which he described as [...] "deplorable, nastily over-violent and obscene, often with undue emphasis on the supernatural and magical as a way of solving problems." [...] He realised that a market existed for a children's comics periodical which featured action stories in cartoon form, but which also would convey to children the standards and morals he advocated. Morris was instrumental in launching the short-lived Society for Christian Publicity, formed to take control of The Anvil and to perhaps produce further Christian publications, and in January 1949 the Daily Mirror published an optimistic piece about the rumoured publication by the Society of a [...] "new children's comic". This intrigued local journalist Norman Price, and the following month he met Morris, and helped him express his desire <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> a magazine by co-writing with him [...] "Comics that bring horror to the nursery", published in the Sunday Dispatch.

500|$|Similar {{to their}} {{experience}} with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named [...] "Lita Halford". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to [...] "bleep" [...] out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label, an icon that Schafer considered {{to be part of}} the history of heavy metal.

Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>such</b> aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were [...] "especially conducive to character creation" [...] due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.|$|E
