5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
25|$|The central chancel east {{window is}} of five lights, {{separated}} by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoilslobes {{formed by the}} overlapping of five circlesand spandrels. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two Tudor windows, both wider than high. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is clear glazed. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.|$|E
25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lateral parterre. The Villa’s private quarters can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of floor levels, there is an elegant dining room that overlooks the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them we see a wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the Villa’s private quarters on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|E

After conceiving {{the idea of the}} film, Asif visited Naushad and handed him a briefcase containing money, telling him to make [...] "memorable music" [...] for Mughal-e-Azam. Offended by the explicit notion of money as a means of gaining quality, Naushad threw the notes out of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surprise of his wife. She subsequently made peace between the two men, and Asif apologised. With this, Naushad accepted the offer to direct the film's soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|Mickey {{becomes the}} victim of {{bullying}} from Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky) in May 2008, who does such things as assaulting Mickey and vandalising his property. Mickey is too scared to take any action against Sean, and relies on his sister's boyfriend, Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord), for protection. On 18 June 2008 he is knocked out when Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) hits him {{over the head with}} a crowbar, whilst trying to steal Dawn's baby, Summer. When Micky awakes, he manages to stop May from absconding with Summer, but she subsequently causes a gas explosion, and the Millers' house goes up in flames. [...] May is killed in the explosion. Mickey, Dawn and Summer are trapped in a first floor bedroom. When Mickey attempts to pass Summer out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> awaiting crowd below, he loses consciousness and drops her, though she is caught by Jase. Dawn pushes an unconscious Mickey out the window, saving his life. Mickey discovers a letter from Rosie, offering Keith a job as a concierge at her home in the Cotswolds. All of the Millers are angry at him for not acknowledging the letter, and Mickey decides to take the job instead as he says there is nothing left for him in Walford. Later, along with Keith and their dog Genghis, Mickey leaves Walford after an emotional farewell at The Queen Victoria pub.|$|E
2500|$|The {{agreement}} {{provides that}} the building in which the seminary functioned has been entrusted to the KU Leuven. This University will thoroughly renovate and update the building, as was done with other historical and University patrimony in the past. Besides serving as a residence for university students, the building will also house a significant new cooperative project, established jointly by the USCCB and KU Leuven, in close consultation with the bishops' conference of Belgium and the francophone sister University in Louvain-la-Neuve (UCL). Through this project, students and researchers will be recruited from the worldwide Catholic community, especially from the United States. Its working language will be English. The students and scholars will be priests, deacons, members of religious institutes and new Catholic movements, and lay persons. The students and scholars will participate in research and/or educational activities at the KU Leuven and/or UCL. In particular, the project will promote work at the faculties with programs in theology, canon law and philosophy. The [...] "Peter Kindekens Fund," [...] named after the first rector of the American College, {{was created in the}} name of the USCCB. The general goal of the Fund is to support educational and research activities which preserve and further the spiritual heritage of the College or ensure that <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> worldwide Catholic community in general and to the Catholic Church in the USA in particular, as was formerly provided by the College, be maintained. This Fund can also grant scholarships in fulfillment of the goals of the project and will administer existing scholarship funds already associated with the College in order to continue to fulfill their intent to support the training of students and priests for service to the Church in the United States. The theological journal Louvain Studies was started by the students in 1966 and is now produced by the KU Leuven faculty.|$|E
