40|$|Genetic markers {{have been}} used since the {{beginnings}} of plant breeding, but the concept of linkage and recently the availability of molecular markers have offered new and powerful tools that can help to perform the traditional tasks of selection or that can change the <b>traditional</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>process.</b> Markers can either {{be used in a}} descriptive manner to identify varieties, to study the ‘micro-evolution’ of composite crosses or variety mixtures or to analyse the breeding progress retrospectively in order to learn from the past. The operative use of markers in plant breeding is connected to the selection of parental lines and progeny lines. The possible implementation of these processes stretches from the introgression of specific chromosome fragments to ‘marker-based idiotype breeding’...|$|E

Genetic engineering can have less impact on the expression of genomes or on protein and metabolite levels than conventional breeding or (non-directed) plant mutagenesis. Toxicologists note that [...] "conventional food is not risk-free; allergies occur with many known and even new conventional foods. For example, the kiwi fruit was introduced into the U.S. and the European markets in the 1960s with no known human allergies; however, today there are people allergic to this fruit." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{value of}} exotic {{germplasm}} in broadening the genetic base of most crops {{has been demonstrated}} many times. However, the difficulties involved in work-ing with exotic germplasm have limited their utility in plant breeding. Unwanted linkages often thwart the suc-cessful incorporation of beneficial exotic genes into commercial lines. Thus, the use of exotics in <b>traditional</b> <b>breeding</b> makes the <b>process</b> of crop improvement a tedious, time-consuming and expensive endeavor. The availability of molecular markers {{makes it possible to}} isolate specific genomic regions and transfer them into commercial varieties with minimal linkage drag. We found a yield-enhancing quantitative trait locus (QTL) from Glycine soja (Siebold and Zucc.) by evaluating a population of 265 BC 2 individuals from a cross between HS- 1 and PI 407305. The yield QTL was located on linkage group B 2 (U 26) of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] genetic linkage map. In a 2 -year, multi-location study, individuals carrying the PI 407305 haplotype at the QTL locus demonstrated a 9. 4 % yield advantage over individuals that did not contain the exotic haplo-type. When tested in a more uniform “HS- 1 -like ” back-ground in two locations, we observed an 8 % yield ad-vantage for lines that carry the PI 407305 haplotype. We further assessed the QTL effect in various elite soybean genetic backgrounds. The yield effect was consistently observed in only two of six genetic backgrounds. Indi-viduals carrying the PI 407305 haplotype at the QTL lo-cus had a 9 % yield advantage in yield trials across loca-tions. Despite the limited adaptability of this yield-QTL across genetic backgrounds, this study demonstrates the potential of exotic germplasm for yield enhancement in soybean...|$|R

30|$|<b>Traditional</b> <b>breeding</b> almost {{depends on}} field {{selection}} by experience of breeders to improve crop variety. However, the selection has many inevitable defects including time-consuming and laborious, low predictability and reproducibility. Using markers, linkage with the target gene {{on the basis}} of DNA sequence, has greatly facilitate accurate and diminish time cost of selection, namely marker-assisted selection (MAS) (Knapp 1998). However, unavoidable recombination limited precision of selection between target gene and markers (Andersen and Lubberstedt 2003). Meanwhile, <b>traditional</b> <b>breeding</b> selection with MAS has no consideration of whole genome elimination of non-target fragments except for selection target phenotype. Therefore, it is still uncertain that the effects of non-target segments and reserve background genome of recurrent parent at the most extent.|$|R
30|$|Another concern {{related to}} the {{patentability}} of cisgenic crops concerns the traceability of cisgenic plants.

It then becomes difficult, if not impossible, to check whether a plant is cisgenic in retrospect and to keep control of where the patentable plant ends up, whether it crosses with other species and the assessment thereof. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the legal and economic consequences for farmers for unintended contamination through gene flow, {{as well as for}} the patent holder to potentially argue that his patent was breached.|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane is {{the main}} source of sucrose in the world and has also become one of the main sources of {{renewable}} energy, thanks to ethanol and electricity production. The main objectives of breeding programs are improving cane biomass and qualities. The genetics of current sugarcane cultivars (Saccharum spp.) are extremely complex, owing to a high polyploid genome of 10 to 12 homeologous chromosome sets, resulting from the interspecific origin of two polyploid ancestral genomes. A century of breeding efforts based on elite domesticated progenitors improved by wild introgressions has helped build one of the most productive biomass crops. However, in recent decades the percentage increase in annual sugarcane yield has been lower than in other crops. Until now, cultivar improvement has relied on <b>traditional</b> <b>breeding</b> programs that require 12 to 15 years of expensive field evaluations. This article discusses the most recent advances in genomics applications to support <b>traditional</b> <b>breeding.</b> In the past two decades, efforts have been made to construct genetic maps, study quantitative trait loci (QTL), and start association mapping studies. Today, genomic selection (GS) approaches to select individuals for advancement in the <b>breeding</b> <b>process</b> is believed to be appropriate for complex traits such as yield, thanks to improved estimates of marker effects combined with a better grasp of small-effect QTLs. GS is particularly attractive in the highly polyploid context of sugarcane, where the nature of yield genetic determinism is presumably highly quantitative. Frequent genotype x environment interactions add to the challenges associated with QTL detection. The focus in this article is on research areas that are likely to result in concrete improvements through advancing the incorporation of association genetics-based approaches. A strategy to design a breeder-friendly marker system is also presented. Plant growth modeling could provide sounder ecophysiological parameters for describing the complex biological process underlying yield and sucrose elaboration. Such models could overcome traditional problems caused by G x E interactions and consequently improve both QTL detection and GS approaches. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
