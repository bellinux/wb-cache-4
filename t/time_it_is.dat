5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> played.

5|$|Peak oil, {{an event}} based on M.

Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> often confused with oil depletion; however, peak oil is the point of maximum production, while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply.|$|E

Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.|$|E
