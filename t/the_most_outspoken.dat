He married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, {{and moved on to}} Victoria College at the University of Toronto in 1929. Havelock's scholarly work during this period focused on Latin poetry, particularly Catullus, far from the early Greek philosophy he had worked on at Cambridge. While in Canada Havelock became increasingly involved in politics. With his fellow academics Frank Underhill and Eugene Forsey, Havelock was a cofounder of the League for Social Reconstruction, an organisation of politically active socialist intellectuals. He and Underhill were also <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> of a group of dissident faculty members at the University.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the First Civil War, the Long Parliament recognized that they would need assistance from the Scots. In return for a military alliance, the Scottish Parliament required the English to sign the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, which stipulated that the English would bring their church into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament sent commissioners to London to represent Scotland's interests to the English Parliament. Eleven of these, four theologians and seven members of Parliament, were also invited to the Assembly. The commissioners were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the Assembly but declined, preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church. Samuel Rutherford, George Gillespie, and Alexander Henderson were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> of the commissioners.|$|E

25|$|Edmund Randolph, who had {{presented}} the Virginia Plan, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> {{opponent of the}} unitary executive, arguing {{that it would be}} unpopular with the people and could easily become monarchical. He warned against using the British government {{as a model for the}} Constitution, noting that energy, dispatch, and responsibility could be found in three men drawn from three different regions of the country just as well as in one. The single executive was nonetheless approved by a vote of 7 to 3.|$|E

25|$|The KGB {{prepared}} the Red Army's route by infiltrating to Czechoslovakia many illegal residents disguised as Western tourists. They were {{to gain the}} trust of and spy upon <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> proponents of Alexander Dubček's new government. They were to plant subversive evidence, justifying the USSR's invasion, that right-wing groups—aided by Western intelligence agencies—were going to depose the Communist government of Czechoslovakia. Finally, the KGB prepared hardline, pro-USSR members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC), such as Alois Indra and Vasiľ Škultéty, to assume power after the Red Army's invasion.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its short history, Proletkult {{had sought}} both {{autonomy}} from state control and hegemony {{in the cultural}} field. This had created {{a substantial number of}} critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class. Of these, Narkompros proved <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> and unyielding in its criticism.|$|E
25|$|Though {{initially}} one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> de Mella supporters, Chicharro did not integrate {{fully in}} the Mellista group; some speak even of “chicharrismo”, others dubbed him “mauro-ciervista”. While de Mella was firm on his Traditionalist principles and opted for a grand conservative party built upon them, Chicharro started to lean towards the vision of Victor Pradera, embracing a more loose Right-wing alliance held together by a lowest common denominator. In the early 1920s he effectively left the Mellistas; some scholars consider him paradigmatic for many rebellious Carlists who joined de Mella in 1919, but soon abandoned him to pursue their own goals and to amalgamate in other Right-wing groupings.|$|E
25|$|During the 2006 mayoral election, Barry {{endorsed}} Adrian Fenty despite Linda Cropp hiring {{many members}} of Barry's former political machine. Barry has publicly clashed with Fenty over D.C.

25|$|Pennington was a {{candidate}} for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825, but he was defeated. During the campaign and as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> members of the Indiana General Assembly, Pennington opposed the state's massive plan for internal improvements, especially {{the construction of the}} Wabash and Erie Canal. He was among the nine legislators, which included James Whitcomb, who voted against the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836. He opposed the majority view, claiming their plans would have no direct benefits for his constituents and would only bankrupt the state. Pennington also argued that the arrival of railroads would quickly make plans for a statewide canal system obsolete. His predictions proved to be nearly correct.|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{formation}} of a new field, genetic engineering, would soon bring biotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate relationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government would ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference, where Joshua Lederberg was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>outspoken</b> supporter for this emerging field in biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the development of synthetic human insulin, Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry grew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising real industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but this number would skyrocket to over 125 {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|E
