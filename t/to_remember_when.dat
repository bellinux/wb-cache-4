500|$|Negative {{reviews from}} critics were mainly {{centered}} around them {{feeling that the}} album was released only for profit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave This Is It {{two and a half}} out of five stars. Erlewine commented that, [...] "an important thing <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> considering the soundtrack to This Is It: this entire film and CD project was never supposed to happen". He noted that Jackson's death had [...] "created considerable demand" [...] for his final rehearsal footage and that This Is It was an [...] "accompaniment" [...] to the film. Andy Gill of The Independent strongly criticized This Is It describing it as being a [...] "shoddy apology for an album" [...] and felt that it was made just for a profit, commenting, ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{viewed the}} novel as a story of [...] "love and money," [...] noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, {{executive}} producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. [...] "I'm from Indiana; if I get it, everyone gets it," [...] he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, [...] "You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?" [...] She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than {{in the book and}} added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. [...] "Family dramas," [...] he stated, [...] "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thom Jurek {{wrote about}} him after his death, [...] "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn’t know it yet. The reason is simple: Like {{the very best}} rock and roll writers and {{performers}} in our history, he’s {{one of the very}} few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it matteredbecause it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E
