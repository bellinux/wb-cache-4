5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{its former}} base in Egypt {{and with its}} ranks {{restored}} with 400 reinforcements <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> in June, the battalion began intensive weapons training. In September it moved to Baggush where on occasion it worked alongside tanks in training exercises. In November 1941, the battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Peart as Gray had been hospitalised, participated in Operation Crusader {{as part of the}} British Eighth Army and was engaged in offensive operations towards the Sidi Azeiz area.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including a batch of reinforcements <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time.|$|E

5|$|The Noronha skink {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis). These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island. The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small island, where streams and pools are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a {{multinational}} mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure aid was distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and bodies were found in some areas on the premises. Personnel promptly set out cleaning the compound's living spaces and work areas {{to make room for}} the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> later also imported extra materials.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Momchil was {{approached}} by agents of Kantakouzenos' opponents, the Constantinopolitan regency, and persuaded to turn against him. Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were far away in eastern Thrace, he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near Portolagos and sank three of them. He then overcame another Turkish force <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion (also known as Burugrad), and plundered several cities {{in the area that}} refused to surrender. Afterwards, Momchil along with 1,000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos, who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him. The Byzantines were thoroughly routed: Kantakouzenos' horse was killed and he received a powerful hit to the head, which he survived thanks to his helmet. Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos' men, but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1948 debut and its {{arrival at}} the Beijing Olympics, Puerto Rican athletes had won six medals (one silver and five bronze). The last medal earned by a Puerto Rican was a bronze medal by Daniel Santos at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. No medals were won by Puerto Ricans at Beijing. During {{the course of the}} 2008 Olympics, 22 athletes {{represented}} Puerto Rico—17 men and five women—in eight sports (track and field, boxing, artistic gymnastics, judo, shooting, swimming, taekwondo, and weightlifting). The size of the delegation was 21 athletes smaller than the Puerto Rican delegation <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and 58 athletes smaller than Puerto Rico's largest Olympic team, which included 80 athletes participating in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal, Canada. The oldest member of the Beijing delegation was Lucas Bennazar, a sharpshooter, who was 39 years old at the time; boxer Jonathan González, in contrast, was the youngest at 19 years old. Boxer McWilliams Arroyo was the nation's flag bearer at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1968 debut and its {{appearance}} at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, {{which took place in}} Moscow in the Soviet Union. With the exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by Barbados at the Olympics (as of Beijing) included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> in 1968 have included female athletes. Prior to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from Barbados. Obadele Thompson won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as part of Barbados' most successful showing at any Olympic games as of 2008.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, the Atlantic, Milos, and Pacific, {{picked up}} 3,600 Jews from Vienna, Gdańsk and Prague in Tulcea, Romania, {{to be sent}} to Palestine. The Jews <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> in Palestine came without entry permits and were {{subsequently}} denied entry by the British government, specifically Sir Harold MacMichael, who was the High Commissioner. The British decided to deport the immigrants to either Trinidad and Tobago or Mauritius, both British colonies. On 25 November 1940, the first ship carrying the 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, the Patria, was accidentally bombed by the Haganah, who wanted the Jews to stay in Palestine. Their intentions were to cripple the ship. There were 260 fatalities and 172 injuries. There were only enough lifeboats for 805, since the capacity was 805 when the Patria was a French ship. When the British repossessed the boat, they increased the capacity to 1,800 but still had the same number of lifeboats.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan's army <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> at Huoyi {{numbered}} {{less than}} its original 30,000 men, perhaps {{as few as}} 25,000, due to the detachments left behind. It was predominantly composed of infantry was divided into six divisions under a general (tongjun), but {{it is unclear how}} they were subordinated to Li Yuan and his sons: Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin were named in the traditional fashion as commanders of the left and right respectively, but in the accounts of the battle, the army appears formed in van, middle and rear divisions. The cavalry, a few hundred strong, was apparently kept as a strategic reserve. Very little is also known about the Sui army, except that Song Laosheng's troops were considered to be elite warriors. Some sources raise their number to 30,000 from the more typical 20,000; this could be an error, or possibly indicate additional forces recruited at Huoyi.|$|E

5|$|The Eichmann Sonderkommando was a {{task force}} headed by Adolf Eichmann <b>that</b> <b>arrived</b> in Budapest on 19 March 1944, {{the same day that}} Axis forces invaded Hungary. Their task was to take a direct role in the {{deportation}} of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The SS-Sonderkommandos enlisted the aide of antisemitic elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro-German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry. Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers. Between 10 and 25 percent of the people on each train were chosen as forced laborers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival. Under international pressure, the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died.|$|E
