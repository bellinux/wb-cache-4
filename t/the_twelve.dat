5|$|According to Twelvers, {{there is}} at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely {{appointed}} authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali {{was the first of}} <b>the</b> <b>Twelve</b> Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver Shia and Alevi Muslims that <b>the</b> <b>Twelve</b> Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of <b>the</b> <b>Twelve</b> Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, {{with the exception of the}} last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{references}} to <b>twelve</b> Etruscan deities {{are due to}} later Roman authors, writing long after {{the influence of the}} Greek pantheon had become dominant, and must be regarded with skepticism. Arnobius states that the Etruscans had a set of six male and six female deities which they called consentes and complices because they rose and set together, implying an astronomical significance, and that these twelve acted as councillors of Jupiter. Scholarly evaluation of this account is dependent on the hypothesis that the Etruscans originally immigrated to Italy from Anatolia. In this case, <b>the</b> Etruscan <b>Twelve</b> might have been cognate to <b>the</b> Hittite <b>Twelve.</b> It is, however, just as possible that <b>the</b> Etruscan <b>Twelve</b> were simply an adaptation of <b>the</b> Greek <b>Twelve</b> just like <b>the</b> Roman <b>Twelve.</b>|$|R
