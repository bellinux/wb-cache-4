40|$|The Dutch {{government}} {{supports the}} academic research workforce through public research funding. However, while this support {{is needed for}} continued economic growth, current trends suggest that present funding and career policies have a transitory effect on the workforce of which mainly permanent researchers benefit. In this study a model is created that describes the influence of funding regimes and career policies on the workforce development and research output over time. The model has been validated and is successful in replicating the observed historical behaviour. The model is then used to conduct several policy experiments to analyse the effect of different policies on the workforce development and research output. The model shows that the increased focus on indirect governmental funding and a temporary workforce, could {{have a negative impact}} on the workforce development and research output at public research organisations. The analysis suggest that competitive funding favours permanent <b>staff</b> <b>member</b> over <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> while not inducing more research output. However, further research is needed to incorporate multiple perceptions and analyse the complex interaction between funding, workforce development and research performance.

40|$|In {{the modern}} {{flexible}} economy, temporary contracts of employment are issued commonly. Concerns have been expressed about this: {{on the one}} hand, that fear of job loss may be harmful to health, {{and on the other}} that actual job loss may be more frequent in those with everyday illnesses. To investigate this second issue, Virtanen et al 1 conducted a cohort study of 60 000 temporary and permanent public sector workers (the Finnish Public Sector Cohort Study). Data were collected on employment contract, sickness absence, job termination, unemployment, and disability pensioning in 1997 – 2000. Several associations were observed. Among women, a high rate of sickness absence increased the odds of later job termination by 1. 5 – 1. 7 fold in temporary workers relative to permanent staff. The effect was less apparent in men. However, among both sexes, <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> with high rates of sickness absence were more likely than permanent contract counterparts to be unemployed three years on. The authors conclude that in relative terms permanent contracts protect against unemployment, even in those with higher sickness absence. EVALUATING A NEW MODEL FOR AIR POLLUTIO...|$|R

40|$|Since I {{finished}} my PhD thesis in June 2014, I have lived a stimulating but also somewhat precarious life at Lund University. It {{is no secret}} that permanent teaching positions {{are hard to come}} by, and during the time I have been teaching as <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> on a number of different courses, I have started to consider what the lack of permanent positions means for the pedagogical work carried out at Lund University. As I see it, two cornerstones in quality teaching are planning and continuity. That is to say, the ability to plan ahead and follow up on experiences from previous teaching in order to continuously improve course content as well as personal teaching skills. The importance of planning and continuity is of course also pertinent to the work that surrounds the actual teaching. Any substantial revision of course plans, as well as practical preparations (e. g. creating schedules, booking rooms and selecting course literature), generally have to take place at least one semester in advance of giving a course. This means that the person responsible for a certain course given in the fall needs to take time out to make these preparations during the spring of the same year. The problem is that these (generally constructive) expectations for planning and continuity tend to clash with the lack of continuity in terms of employment. Given that all available positions must be filled in open competition, <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> will often not know for sure half a year in advance if their employment at the university will continue. Furthermore, <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> may shift between teaching and research positions, which further complicates things. Situations have occurred, for example, where a person is temporarily employed as a researcher, but is asked to take (unpaid) time out of their research to plan for the following semester a course they have taught previously, without any guarantee that they will actually be teaching it again. From {{the point of view of}} the structure put in place to ensure continuity, this practice seems to make sense, as it ostensibly ensures previous experiences with the course are taken into account (though one may wonder how the quality of the pedagogical work is affected if the employee who does the planning does not end up actually teaching the course). For the individual employees who are asked to do the planning work for free, however, it is a dilemma: should they engage in the planning to ensure pedagogical quality and continuity if this at the same time contributes to keeping in place the very system of impermanent employment that creates the dilemma in the first place?Possible topics for discussion at this roundtable include, but are not limited to:- Ways that the status as a temporary employee may impede pedagogical performance. - Ways to overcome the pedagogical and practical challenges in planning and teaching that impermanent employment creates. - Experiences with expectations from colleagues (teachers, administrative staff, programme administrators, etc.) regarding the involvement of <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> in the planning of courses they may not end up teaching, as well as responses from <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> to these expectations. - Ways the university can/does handle the loss of experience that comes with impermanent <b>staff</b> <b>members</b> not having an opportunity to follow up and develop courses they have taught...|$|R
30|$|Currently, schools hire <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> on {{an ad hoc}} {{basis to}} provide {{technical}} support.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changing {{structure of the}} UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry. It argues that despite the research produced recently on the different non-standard employment contracts, such as fixed-term, part-time and temporary work, relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry as an industry in itself. In light of this perceived gap in the literature, this paper first separates out the evolution of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry in to three periods. Second it draws upon an on-going programme of research to analyse conceptually the restructuring of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry. Third it places the UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry in context, drawing upon a series of semi-structured interviews with <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agency owners and managers.

Designed to allow project-based work and <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> in sectors plagued by shortages of highly skilled workers (e.g., software specialists), the 1985 law limited <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> to a [...] "white list" [...] of 13 occupations. But subsequent revisions steadily expanded its range of application. Notably, the 1999 revision replaced the [...] "white list" [...] with a short [...] "black list" [...] of occupations where <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> remained restricted.

40|$|The <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> {{industry}} has experienced significant growth {{in recent decades}} across many countries and sectors. The particular characteristics of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry {{are influenced by the}} national institutional context in which they are embedded. This article presents empirical findings to investigate of the concept of a national <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry using two case studies, the UK and Germany. Through analysis of two national markets for <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> the article discusses the importance of investigating the wider institutional environment in which an industry is embedded, the interactions and interdependencies between the actors involved, and the relationships and activities through which an industry is co-created and constituted. Theoretically, this seeks to stress the importance of considering how institutional systems change, rather than focusing on characteristics used to categorise socio-economic systems. Empirically, this article reveals the features and developments of two national <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industries within Europe. This advances of our understanding of changes in the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry in two European settings, but also highlights the importance of considering geographically specific national varieties of economic systems as dynamic institutional ecologies...|$|R

50|$|As {{the number}} of <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> {{agencies}} grew (e.g. ASB, Manpower Inc., Evro and Tempo-Team), <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies acquired a poor image. Part of the criticism was political; trade unions and left-wing parties wished the government to have greater control over the labor market and also over employment mediation. Unions were concerned that <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> had no rights, might earn more than permanent staff, that employers would replace permanent jobs by temporary ones, that only people who were relatively mobile got temporary jobs and that <b>temporary</b> <b>staff</b> would be given only dirty and heavy work.

40|$|During the 1990 s the UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> {{industry}} experienced almost unbroken year-on-year growth. Alongside this quantitative expansion {{the type}} of business performed by some UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies has begun to change, as some larger agencies have attempted {{to move out of}} the clerical and light industrial segments and into higher value-added markets. Other agencies have sought to add human resource services to their more-traditional recruitment and placement functions. All in all, the UK industry [...] the second largest in the world after the United States [...] has undergone widespread restructuring in the last decade. I argue that the recent growth in the UK industry constitutes a regularisation of flexible employment, as casual and fixed-term contracts are replaced by more formal arrangements involving a third party [...] the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agency. Drawing upon global and national data and forty semi-structured interviews with agency owners and managers in the United Kingdom, I analyse the multidimensional growth and restructuring of the UK <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry. I argue that as the UK industry 'matures' we are witnessing a degree of deepening in relations between <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies and client firms. More broadly, I argue that the growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry has conceptual implications for how economic geographers theorise 'the firm' and explore the globalisation of service activities. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper does three things. First it {{reviews the}} {{existing}} conceptual {{work on the}} expansionary strategies of producer services and argues that while illuminating it has paid insufficient attention to {{the implications of the}} internationalization/diversification of <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies, the effects of which are not limited to the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry but also bleed into a host of other manufacturing and service industries. Second, and in light of this, it profiles the internationalization and diversification strategies of leading <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies. It argues that while, on the one hand, the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry exhibits the characteristics of a classic producer service sector, on the other hand, its product [...] labour [...] distinguishes it in part from the likes of the accounting, advertising, and legal sectors. Its wider political-economic implications, in this case, are the ways in which agency strategies affect labour markets at a range of geographical scales, and how this is best understood. Third, and finally, the paper argues that the growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> is the result of, and a contributing factor to, the on-going restructuring of national and urban labour markets. In going about their business, <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies contribute, so the paper argues, to the neo-liberalization of national and urban economies, and in doing so create conditions favourable to their continued growth.

40|$|Shifting {{the burden}} for {{unemployment}} insurance: business cycles, business strategies, and the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry The advent of labor flexibility—regarded as {{a hallmark of}} the New Economy—was widely heralded during the nearly decade-long economic expansion of the 1990 s for helping U. S. firms achieve competitive advantages. In labor markets, flexibility has been achieved via the proliferation of contingent staffing arrangements such as independent contracting, on-call workers, and especially employment through <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies. The phenomenal growth of the <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> industry (TSI) was one of the defining features of the 1990 s economic expansion, coming as it did {{on the heels of the}} 1980 s when the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>staffing</b> agencies operating in U.
