40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} {{has been used}} for years to provide a determination of the proper functioning of different types of machinery, including rotating machinery and rocket engines. A determination of a malfunction, if detected at a relatively early stage in its development, will allow changes in operating mode or a sequenced shutdown of the machinery prior to a total failure. Such preventative measures result in less extensive and/or less expensive repairs, and can also prevent a sometimes catastrophic failure of equipment. Standard vibration analyzers are generally rather complex, expensive, and of limited portability. They also usually result in displays and controls being located remotely from the machinery being monitored. Consequently, a need exists for improvements in accelerometer electronic display and control functions which are more suitable for operation directly on machines and which are not so expensive and complex. The invention includes methods and apparatus for detecting mechanical vibrations and outputting a signal in response thereto. The apparatus includes an accelerometer package having integral display and control functions. The accelerometer package is suitable for mounting upon the machinery to be monitored. Display circuitry provides signals to a bar graph display which may be used to monitor machine condition over a period of time.

40|$|As a {{spacecraft}} performs its mission, various loads {{are connected to}} the spacecraft power bus in response to commands from an on board computer, a function called power distribution. For the Mariner Mark II set of planetary missions, the power bus is 30 volts dc and when loads are connected or disconnected, both the bus and power return side must be switched. In addition, the power distribution function must be immune to single point failures and, when power is first applied, all switches must be in a known state. Traditionally, these requirements have been met by electromechanical latching relays.

First, a detailed analytical analysis of the circuit implemented with these current sources is performed; it indicates the one best suited for this application and provides key sizing equations. Next, the chosen current source is employed to design the thermal shutdown protection of an integrated Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator (LDO) for automotive applications.

40|$|Abstract: What {{could be}} more basic than a voltage reference—a simple, {{constant}} reference voltage? As is all design topics, there are tradeoffs. This article discusses {{the different types of}} voltage references, their key specifications,and the design tradeoffs, including accuracy, temperature-independence, current drive capability, power dissipation, stability, noise, and cost. You can find voltage references inside almost any advanced electronic product, either standalone or integrated into larger functions. For example: In a data converter, a reference provides an absolute voltage to compare to the input voltage to determine the proper digital code. In a voltage regulator, a reference provides a known value which is compared to the output to develop the feedback that is used to regulate the output voltage. In a voltage detector circuit, the reference is used as an absolute threshold to set the <b>trip</b> <b>point.</b> The required specifications depend on the application. This article discusses the different types of voltage references, their key specifications,and design tradeoffs.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the past}} decades CMOS IC {{technologies}} have been constantly scaled down and at present they aggressively {{entered in the}} nanometer regime. Amongst the wide-ranging variety of circuit applications, integrated memories especially the SRAM cell layout has been significantly reduced. As it is very well know the reduction of size of CMOS involves an increase in physical parameters variation, this is a factor which has {{a direct impact on}} SRAM cell stability. Polysilicon and diffusion critical dimensions (CD) together with implant variations are the main causes of mismatch in SRAM cells. SRAM memory cells have always been designed to occupy the minimum amount of silicon area consistent with the performance and reliability required. Today’s system on Chip (SoC) trends result in a major percentage of the total die area being dedicated to memory blocks, consequently making SRAM parameter variations dominate the overall circuit parameter characteristics, including leakage, process variation effects, etc. The reliability is usually measured by static noise margin, SNM [1], and write <b>trip</b> <b>point</b> simulations and measurements. In this paper we have analyzed the stability of the 9 T SRAM cell at SS...|$|E
40|$|The NCP 1250 is {{a highly}} {{integrated}} PWM controller capable of delivering a rugged and high performance offline power supply in a tiny TSOP− 6 package. With a supply range up to 28 V, the controller hosts a jittered 65 kHz or 100 kHz switching circuitry operated in peak current mode control. When the power on the secondary side starts to decrease, the controller automatically folds back its switching frequency down to a minimum level of 26 kHz. As the power further goes down, the part enters skip cycle while limiting the peak current. Over Power Protection (OPP) is a difficult exercise especially when no−load standby requirements drive the converter specifications. The ON proprietary integrated OPP lets you harness the maximum delivered power without affecting your standby performance simply via two external resistors. An Over Voltage Protection input is also combined on the same pin and protects the whole circuitry in case of optocoupler failure or adverse open loop operation.

Two fundamentally different switch-off mechanisms can be used. The controls switch off the actuator {{as soon as}} the set <b>tripping</b> <b>point</b> has been reached. This is called limit seating. However, there are valve types for which the closing element has to be moved in the end position at a defined force or a defined torque to ensure that the valve seals tightly. This is called torque seating. The controls are programmed as to ensure that the actuator is switched off when exceeding the set torque limit. The end position is signalled by a limit switch.|$|R

40|$|Several {{emerging}} {{devices have}} been proposed to continue the CMOS scaling. To assess scalability, device and circuit variability estimation is essential. Variability in static noise margin (SNM) in a 6 T-SRAM cell is a key metric {{to assess the impact}} of device-level variability at the circuit level. This is usually enabled by SPICE simulations, which needs device compact models. However, the development of a SPICE model usually takes a significant amount of time (e. g., a few years). In this paper, we present a method to enable the evaluation of the SRAM cell SNM variability based on the I-D-V-G distribution at various VDS values of a device (obtained either experimentally or from TCAD), which can enable this assessment before the development of a SPICE model. Thus, it enhances the accuracy by being able to capture the effects of full I-D-V-G distribution rather than just VT distribution. The method is validated against HSPICE for a variety of SRAM parameters, such as Read, Hold, and Write SNM, write <b>trip</b> <b>point,</b> and read current (I-READ) to show excellent accuracy. The method also shows a 30 x improvement in computational efficiency over mixed-mode TCAD-based stochastic SRAM simulation.
