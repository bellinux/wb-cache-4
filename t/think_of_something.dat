He would then figure out how it could logically have happened, which he said was the most compelling method, story-wise; if it were done in the other direction – starting with how the case would work logically and then adding a twist - he found that it would not [...] "ring true". He found that coming up with ways of resolving these mysteries was very difficult compared to coming up with the set-up. He worked towards including story developments that would [...] "keep [...] guessing", and puzzles that [...] "appeal to their curiosity". He tried to create scenarios that make the player interested, which resulted in the bombing in the first episode and how the second episode's murderer appears to be a mythical creature. Among scrapped ideas for the episodes were a case of an [...] "ethereal murder" [...] where the suspect remembers killing someone but there is no body and no evidence of it even happening, and a case where a doll has been killed. He noted that these ideas, while having an impact and sounding interesting, were unrealistic and would not work. Yamazaki took inspirations from several different kinds of stories, including books, movies and television; the second episode in particular was inspired by the works of the author Natsuhiko Kyogoku.|$|E

2500|$|... all {{mediation}} is remediation. We are not claiming {{this as an}} {{a priori}} truth, but rather arguing that at this extended historical moment, all current media function as remediators and that remediation offers us a means of interpreting the work of earlier media as well. Our culture conceives of each medium or constellation of media as it responds to, redeploys, competes with, and reforms other media. In the first instance, we may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> like a historical progression, of newer media remediating older ones and in particular of digital media remediating their predecessors. But ours is a genealogy of affiliations, not a linear history, and in this genealogy, older media can also remediate newer ones. (p. 55) ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood {{characterized}} {{the film as}} a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy. He wrote: [...] " [...] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us {{to feel sorry for}} him... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E
2500|$|While Yanni {{has said}} that new age is [...] "a spiritual {{definition}} more than a musical definition," [...] his music has been said to be [...] "adopted by" [...] the New Age movement as it gained mainstream momentum. His music is also called contemporary instrumental and {{has been described as}} [...] "an instrumental blend of fusion-jazz, world music, classical, and soft rock." [...] However, at least as early as 1988, Yanni was said to shun labels such as [...] "Greek" [...] and [...] "new age," [...] emphasizing that [...] "when someone says new age music, I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> that you put on in the background while you're vacuuming the house. I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested." [...] Distinguishing his work from what others have called ambient mood music, Yanni pointed out in 1994: [...] "New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} {{in regards to}} how functional fixedness relates to problem solving. There are also {{many ways in which}} a person can run into problems while thinking of a particular object with having this function. If there is one way in which a person usually <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> rather than multiple ways then this can lead to a constraint in how the person <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> that particular object. This can be seen as narrow minded thinking, which is defined as a way in which one is not able to see or accept certain ideas in a particular context. Functional fixedness is very closely related to this as previously mentioned. This can be done intentionally and or unintentionally, {{but for the most part}} it seems as if this process to problem solving is done in an unintentional way.|$|R
