40|$|Restricted Access. This paper {{describes}} a {{comparative study of}} self-assembled monolayers of different discoid molecules containing thioether, thiol, or disulfide substituents on gold. Discotic liquid crystalline hexaalkylthio-substituted <b>triphenylenes</b> and tricycloquinazolines, and derivatized <b>triphenylenes</b> with a single long omega-thioalkyl or omega-dithioalkyl substituent, are shown to self-assemble from dilute solution onto gold surfaces. Monolayers are formed owing to the known strong interaction of these functional groups with the gold. The characterization of the monolayers includes contact angle, polarized grazing incidence Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The discotic hexaalkyl thioethers assemble essentially face-on and without detectable lateral order onto the gold substrate. The alkyl chains do not lie flat on the gold but cover the aromatic cores. In contrast, the aromatic cores of the molecules in the monolayers of the discoid monosubstituted <b>triphenylenes</b> with a single thiol or disulfide substituent are shown to be in edge-on orientation.

40|$|Discotic {{liquid crystal}} {{research}} {{is now more}} than 30 years old, however it is still early days compared with the well-established area of calamitic liquid crystal research which dates back {{for more than a}} century. Since the 1990 ’s there has been great deal of interest in discotic liquid crystal research, due to applications such as discotic compensation films for enhancing liquid crystal display (LCD) viewing angles and exciting new potential applications such as organic semi-conductors and photovoltaics. The work contained in this thesis can be broken down into three major areas: investigation of synthetic methodologies of hexasubstituted triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals, examination of structure-property relationships within novel triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystalline materials, and the design and mesomorphic properties of novel disc-shaped molecular architectures. The investigation of the synthetic methodologies of triphenylene-based liquid crystals examined two main areas of the synthesis of triphenylene-based discotic materials: iodination reactions to generate valuable intermediates, and the oxidative strategies and methods for the generation of hexasubstituted <b>triphenylenes.</b> These investigations have revealed that careful control over reaction conditions can offer great selectivity in the synthesis of halogenated intermediates for the synthesis of triphenylene-based liquid crystals and that electron rich intermediate species offer the greatest scope for the synthesis of hexasubstituted <b>triphenylenes</b> in good yield and purity. The determination of structure-property relationships within triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals has examined various peripheral substituents and various near-core modifications to the conventional discotic liquid crystal. A small number of novel spiral-shaped materials have been synthesised, which have revealed interesting mesomorphic properties. These materials have shown the ability to self-organise in such a manner as to fill free space around central disc units so as to generate columnar mesophases in materials which would not otherwise be expected to exhibit mesomorphism.

40|$|Abstract We {{set up a}} {{model for}} discotic liquid crystal dimers and study, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, their phase {{behaviour}} and self–assembling properties, {{in comparison with the}} simpler monomeric case. Each discotic dimer is described by two oblate Gay–Berne ellipsoids connected by a flexible spacer, modelled by a harmonic “spring ” of three different lengths. We find that dimerization in general yields produces a significant change on the phase behaviour, with an increase of the columnar–nematic transition temperature, a widening of the nematic region and the apparent suppression of the crystalline phase in favour of the columnar phase up to very low temperatures. Longer spacers prove to ease the formation of columns and to increase the orientational order. Keywords Monte Carlo · <b>Triphenylenes</b> · Gay–Berne · Columnar phase · Liquid crystal...|$|R

The self-assembly properties make them more desirable for manufacturing purposes when producing commercial electronics, than the currently used small molecule crystals in Sony’s new OLED displays. Also they have the added benefit of the self-healing properties that both the small molecule and the polymers lack as conductors, potentially being beneficial for longevity OLED products.|$|E
50|$|The first discotic {{liquid crystal}} was found in 1977 by the Indian {{researcher}} Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, {{a large number of}} discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which <b>triphenylene,</b> porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, processibility, and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and liquid}} crystalline properties of two novel series of <b>triphenylenes</b> with 4 or 5 pentafuoropentyloxy tails and 1 or 2 alkoxy tails of varying length are reported.

40|$|Using Monte Carlo {{simulations}} we {{calculate the}} frequency {{dependence of the}} diffusive mobility {{of a group of}} carriers on a short one-dimensional chain. We allow the carriers to interact with each other through weakly screened long-range Coulomb potentials. We consider both doped systems with discrete immobile counterions and gated systems with constant neutralizing background. In doped systems the counterions can act as traps for the mobile charge, which results in a strong frequency-dependent conductivity. In the gated charged system, the mobility per particle decreases with particle density. The calculations show that the electron–electron interaction, in the diffusion limit, acts very much like a source of random disorder. Because the mobility depends on the number of carriers, arrays of coupled wires can exhibit current “noise” which is directly related to charge exchange between the wires. This noise is in principle observable in signal processing. Basing ourselves on our numerical results, {{we have been able to}} conclude that the low-frequency ac mobility measured in doped <b>triphenylenes</b> must be due to spatial charge inhomogeneities, and cannot be due to intrinsic charge dynamics.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the photophysical {{properties}} of columnar liquid crystals formed by hexakis-(alky 1 oxy) <b>triphenylenes.</b> Absorption and fluorescence spectra of solutions are analyzed {{on the basis of}} quantum chemical calculations performed by the CS-INDO-CI (conformations spectra-intermediate neglect of differential overlap-configuration interaction) me thd. the absorption maximum is due to the SO- Sq transition while fluorescence originates from the weak SO- S 1 transition. In columnar aggregates, the former transition corresponds to delocalized excited states while the latter corresponds to localized ones; calculation of intermolecular interactions shows that, at the temperature domain of the mesophases, all the molecules have the same excitation energy and, therefore, no spectral diffusion of the fluorescence is expected, in agreement with the time-resolved emission spectra. Excitation transfer is investigated by studying the fluorescence decays of mesophases doped with energy traps. Their analysis is made by means of Monte Carlo simulations considering both intracolumnar and intercolumnar jumps and using four different models for the distance dependence of the hopping probability.

The {{physical and chemical}} properties of the excited singlet state of the trioxatriangulenium (TOTA(+)) carbenium ion are investigated by experimental and Computational means. The degeneracy of the lowest excited states is counteracted by Jahn-Teller-type distortion, which leads to vibronic broadening of the long wavelength absorption band.
