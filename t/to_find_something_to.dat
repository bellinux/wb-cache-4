5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> treat her wounds. He {{is interrupted by}} a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly {{at the cost of}} her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On the rare occasions that they do manage <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E

When she is unsuccessful, Neal and Mulan set out for Rumpelstiltskin's castle, hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> lead them to Emma and Henry. When they arrive there, they meet Robin Hood, who has taken up residence in the castle, but allows them to search for what they seek to repay the life debt he owes Rumpelstiltskin. Finding his father's old staff, Neal manages to uncover a concealed cabinet full of magical objects, including a crystal ball that tells him that Emma is in Neverland.|$|E

[...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V.

500|$|Mark Walton, {{while writing}} for GameSpot, {{thought that the}} general idea for the game was good, but that the {{gameplay}} was [...] "tiresome" [...] and failed to excite. He said that the animation was [...] "woefully bad", and there were several bugs such as the cover taking mechanism failing to work on several occasions. An attempt to bring variety to the game through minigames was seen as [...] "a poor mishmash of those from other games", and compared those sections to other games such as Portal and the Uncharted series. Walton explained that the game made [...] "small wins" [...] by including the voice acting from the same cast as the movie, but {{said that there were}} [...] "too many glaring problems" [...] with the game <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> like. He gave it a score of 3.5 out of ten for the version on PC.|$|E
