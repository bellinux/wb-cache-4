5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> sort of clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E

5|$|Originally, under , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, {{each state}} {{legislature}} elected its state's senators for a six-year term. Each state, regardless of size, {{is entitled to}} two senators {{as part of the}} Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states. This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10–1. There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the central government was granted substantially more power than before; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti-federalists that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government, providing a check on the power of the federal government.|$|E

However, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> change in the measured signal, because of Doppler shifting caused by {{the motion of the}} Earth.

25|$|Through 2010, CBS {{broadcast}} the remaining 63 {{games of the}} NCAA tournament proper.

Coverage preempted regular programming on the network, except during a 2-hour window from about 5 ET until 7 ET when the local affiliates could show programming. The CBS format resulted in far fewer hours of first-round coverage than under the old ESPN format but allowed the games to reach a much larger audience than ESPN was able to reach.|$|E

The IMF chief Rodrigo de Rato has criticised attempts made by the United States, People's Republic of China and some other nations to depress fuel prices, and advocated raising prices, instead of tax breaks or subsidies at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries seminar {{on the first day of}} the conference. He added that domestic pricing policies for refined fuel should reflect the scarcity of the resource, and high world crude oil prices. He acknowledged <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> political resistance to raise the oil prices, but he mentioned successful experiences in Indonesia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He called for adequate investment in the oil industry to ease concerns about oil supply in the later years, and appealed oil producing countries to balance the spending and savings for future generations. The IMF warned that the global markets faces a risk of a major setback, including an economic downturn in the United States, falling home prices, further surge in oil prices, interest rate rises to contain inflationary pressures, which the IMF said in its twice a year report on global financial stability.|$|E

500|$|It was {{the longstanding}} {{view of a}} segment of the UFA that the Alberta {{government}} should enter the banking business directly by obtaining a bank charter from the federal government (which has responsibility for banking under the Canadian constitution). [...] In fact, UFA President William John Tregillus had included the idea in a speech he gave on his goals for the organization in 1913. At the UFA convention in 1923, a proponent of a provincial banking, George Bevington, made a passionate speech in favour of this idea, bringing most of the membership around to his side. [...] The convention passed a resolution in favour of the idea (along with one calling on the provincial treasury to establish a loan department, an idea that came to fruition fifteen years later with the creation of Alberta Treasury Branches), against the stiff opposition of Attorney-General Brownlee. [...] Brownlee's opposition stemmed in part from investigations that Greenfield's government had already undertaken into the subject: information was gathered from similar experiments in New Zealand and New South Wales, leading to the conclusion that, while <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>some</b> benefit to a provincially owned bank, Alberta [...] "had neither the economic nor constitutional base to consider such a scheme". [...] This conclusion was affirmed by University of Alberta professor D. A. MacGibbon in a government-commissioned study.|$|E
