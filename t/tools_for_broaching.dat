40|$|Broaching is a {{precision}} multipoint metal removal operation normally employed for manufacturing variety of complex parts having either {{internal or external}} features. Broaching can produce high precision and good surface finish at a high metal removal rate. The unique feature of a broach tool is that the feed/depth of cut for the teeth {{is built into the}} broach unlike other cutting tools. The tool design (e. g., rise per tooth and tooth geometry) {{play a vital role in}} the broach performance. A specially adapted machine tool modified to investigate a single broach tooth has been used. Cutting forces and material removal rate have been measured during experimental work for different combination of broaching parameters and broach tool geometry. The effect of the parameters on the surface quality produced has been established. The characteristics of chips formed have also been defined. Finally, optimum tooth geometry and rise per tooth have been recommended <b>for</b> <b>tool</b> performance, <b>broached</b> surface quality and efficient chip formation. The information provided in this paper will be beneficial <b>for</b> <b>broach</b> <b>tool</b> designers and manufacturing engineers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an approach <b>for</b> automatic <b>broaching</b> <b>tool</b> design <b>for</b> a user-defined complex-shaped slot. A systematic method {{was developed to}} generate a cutting strategy <b>for</b> the <b>broach.</b> A set of technological constraints such as maximum allowed cutting force per tooth or maximum allowed rise per tooth are considered. Thereby, an optimization based on the cutting forces is carried out. Aim of the automatic, technological and geometrical based broaching tool design {{is to reduce the}} total length of the broaching tool. Hence, manufacturing cost of the tool itself is reduced as well as manufacturing time of each slot and thereby, production costs of the slots are optimized...|$|R

Pull style machines are basically vertical machines {{laid on the}} side with a longer stroke.

Once the broaching cycles have been performed, different strategies have been analyzed including the evolution of the maximum peak force and the evolution in the used broaching energy per section. Finally, the results of the analysis and the main conclusions are presented...|$|R

5|$|<b>For</b> {{internal}} <b>broaching</b> {{the sides}} of the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; <b>for</b> external <b>broaching</b> the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|R
500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] <b>For</b> surface <b>broaching</b> the RPT is usually between [...] and <b>for</b> diameter <b>broaching</b> is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors.

They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). <b>For</b> <b>broaching</b> to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|R

40|$|Broaching {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recognised}} machining processes that can yield high productivity and high quality when applied properly. One big disadvantage of broaching is that all process parameters, except cutting speed, are built into the broaching tools. Therefore, it is not possible to modify the cutting conditions during the process once the tool is manufactured. Optimal design of broaching tools has a significant impact to increase the productivity and to obtain high quality products. In this paper, an optimisation model <b>for</b> <b>broaching</b> design is presented. The model results in a non-linear non-convex optimisation problem. Analysis of the model structure indicates that the model can be decomposed into smaller problems.
