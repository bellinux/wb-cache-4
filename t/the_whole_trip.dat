5|$|Many butterflies, such as {{the painted}} lady, monarch, and several danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place {{over a number of}} generations and no single {{individual}} completes <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>trip.</b> The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British painted lady undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has been {{characterized}} by {{a substantial increase in}} transport volume. In particular, road networks have reached their limits. Increasing emissions, congestion, and accidents have signalled a need for action. Besides technological innovations and behavioral change due to regulations, incentivizing voluntary modal change is increasingly becoming important for European policy makers. The deployment of a multimodal information and ticketing system (MMITS) is considered an appropriate incentive to facilitate intermodal trips by reducing transaction costs and uncertainty (the system provides pre- and on-trip information and a booking option for one ticket for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> intermodal <b>trip).</b> This study analysed travelers´ willingness to accept such a system and the impact of the intention to use an MMITS on travelers´ modal choice, especially for medium and long distances. From a sample of six European countries, multiple regression analyses reveal high acceptance of the MMITS but a low impact on the intended behavioral change. Remarkably, for frequent car users, a reverse relationship is identified. The results give empirical proof that MMITS has an impact on travelers with weak habits and an empirical basis for the political decision whether to promote the deployment of an MMITS...|$|R

2500|$|During {{production}} on Kingdom of the Sun, Andreas Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated supermodeling poses published in magazines {{in order to}} capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona.

Furthermore, yellow cabs are concentrated around Manhattan and the two main airports (JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport), while green cabs are allowed above the 110 th Street in Manhattan and in the outer-boroughs of New York City.

40|$|The Cincinnatian Series (ca. 450 to 442 Ma) of the Cincinnati Arch {{features}} some of {{the most}} spectacular Ordovician fossils in the world. The rich faunas of bryozoans, brachiopods, molluscs, echinoderms, and trilobites are preserved as discrete shell-rich limestones, cyclically interbedded with sparsely fossiliferous shales and mudstones that may yield exceptionally preserved trilobites and crinoids. Similar successions of shell beds interbedded with mudstones are common components of Paleozoic successions. In such successions, the genesis of the highly concentrated shell beds is often attributed to storm-winnowing, but is this <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story? This <b>trip</b> will offer an overview of the classic Cincinnatian Series, with ample opportunity for examining and collecting the rich fossil assemblages throughout much of the succession.

5000|$|After reading George Adamski's Flying Saucers Have Landed (1953) and Inside the Space Ships (1955), Klarer {{recalled}} {{that she had}} been receiving occasional telepathic messages from a friendly space alien named Akon since childhood. Akon was presumably unrelated to Adamski's Venusian space friend Orthon. She was able to take photos of the ship from the Drakensberg Mountains on July 17, 1955. This was a similar arrangement to that made by Adamski with Orthon in 1952. [...] Klarer managed to call down Akon and his scout ship on April 7, 1956, for an actual landing. She was carried up to the mother ship in earth orbit, and - now the story becomes somewhat different from the mid-1950s contactee standard - was eventually transported in 1957 to Akon's home planet, Meton, orbiting in the nearby multiple-star system Alpha Centauri, where she and Akon had sex, she became pregnant, and eventually delivered a male child. Her son, Ayling, stayed behind on Meton to be educated, while Klarer came home. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> process, <b>trip,</b> lovemaking, pregnancy, delivery and return trip, supposedly required less than four months. Klarer took far more time before publishing a book, Beyond the Light Barrier (1980), about her extraterrestrial adventures. On his world lecture tour in the late 1950s, George Adamski made a point of visiting South Africa and looking up Klarer for a chat on their variety of experiences with the friendly, wise [...] "Space Brothers."

[...] She also explained Theresa's motive: [...] "Well, she'd recently had a night of naughtiness with Calvin, and as a result she fell pregnant. She was really stressed out about it and he's getting married so she thinks, 'If I go and tell him maybe he won't get married to her and maybe he'll want to bring up the baby with me'.
