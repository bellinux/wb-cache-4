And by using convex combination of the interval beginings and endings, we can obtain a linear function of an analogous variable with each one of the inputs and output’s components; so that we can obtain a function for <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> data via crisp processes. Finally, we represent an algorithm for improving <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> interval...|$|R
