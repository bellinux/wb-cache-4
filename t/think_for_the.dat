500|$|Kovalainen's {{failure to}} score, {{combined}} with the two Ferraris making the top three, meant that Ferrari extended their lead over McLaren in the Constructors' Championship from seven to 11points. Massa said Ferrari had succeeded in the race: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Drivers' Championship it was not fantastic but for the Constructors' it was very good." [...] Kubica's sixth place at the Grand Prix ruled out any chance of claiming the Drivers' Championship. The BMW driver said his focus would now be on getting as good a result as possible in Brazil, saying [...] "There is now one race left, and I shall try hard to defend my third place." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the event, Dahl began his regular morning {{broadcast}} by reading the indignant headlines in the local papers. He mocked the coverage, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn't have done. Bad little Cohos." [...] Tigers manager Anderson stated of the events, [...] "Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But I think those kids were doing things other than beer." [...] Columnist David Israel of the Chicago Tribune commented on July 12 {{that he was not}} surprised by what had occurred, [...] "It would have happened any place 50,000 teenagers got together on a sultry summer night with beer and reefer." [...] White Sox pitcher Rich Wortham, a Texan, suggested, [...] "This wouldn't have happened if they had country and western night." ...|$|E
500|$|They said, [...] "Victoria Principal {{could be}} set to make a shock return to legendary drama series Dallas after stars Patrick Duffy and Jesse Metcalfe let slip {{producers}} want her in the show's upcoming reboot. The actress' character, Pamela Ewing, was written out of the series in 1987, when viewers were told she had only months to live after fleeing the Texan dynasty." [...] In an added piece, they said: [...] "But the storyline was left open-ended, and it's now emerged Principal – who is the only surviving member of the show's original cast not {{signed up for the}} relaunch later this year – could be brought back to Dallas in an explosive plot." [...] Jesse Metcalfe said, [...] "She hasn't (come back) – she hasn't as yet. But I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> producers of the show, it's an open invitation." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{military}} intelligence, the Russian doctrine roughly {{corresponds to}} Western notions of denial and deception. The United States Army's Glossary of Soviet Military Terminology from 1955 defined maskirovka as [...] "camouflage; concealment; disguise." [...] The International Dictionary of Intelligence from 1990 defined {{it as the}} Russian military intelligence (GRU) term for deception. Robert Pringle's 2006 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence defined it as strategic deception. Scott Gerwehr's The Art of Darkness summarized it as deception and operational security. The historian Tom Cubbage commented that military deception was enormously successful for the Soviets, and whatever the United States might <b>think,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union {{it was something to}} make use of both in war and in peacetime. An article in The Moscow Times explained: [...] "But маскировка has a broader military meaning: strategic, operational, physical and tactical deception. Apparently in U.S. military terminology, this is called either CC (camouflage, concealment and deception) or more recently D (denial and deception). It is the whole shebang—from guys in ski masks or uniforms with no insignia, to undercover activities, to hidden weapons transfers, to—well, starting a civil war but pretending that you've done nothing of the sort." ...|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, {{he was not going to}} tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.” ...|$|E
