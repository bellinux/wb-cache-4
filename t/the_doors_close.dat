25|$|The next morning, George {{finds the}} sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open. His time machine sits just inside. He enters, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close,</b> and George is {{attacked}} {{in the dark}} by Morlocks. George sends his time machine hurtling into the past, back to 1900, coming {{to rest on the}} lawn outside his home, where the story had begun, and now ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} doors {{open to reveal}} the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting {{on a table in}} the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end of}} the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close.</b>|$|E
25|$|Don and Roma reach Vardhaan and Jabbar. When {{ordered by}} Vardhaan and Jabbar - and even Don himself - Roma is shot by Jabbar when {{she refuses to}} kill Don. She still has {{feelings}} for Don, although he killed her brother five years earlier, and she also refused to kill him because she refused {{to do it the}} illegal way. Don defeats Vardhaan and his thugs, and kills Jabbar. Don ultimately saves the entire team. Don obtains his immunity papers, surrendering the plates and a disc with information about his team. He brings Roma to a waiting ambulance, and they exchange glances before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close.</b> Don later detonates a bomb planted earlier in Diwan's car.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> typically until a timeout occurs and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> <b>The</b> {{operation of}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working {{door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a <b>door</b> open push. <b>The</b> minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in <b>the</b> US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of the most {{expensive}} in the series at the time, with two visual effects milestones for the series. During one of the sequences, the visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2D to 3D versions. The producers wished to exceed the minute-long Horizon sequence in the previous episode. The scene where <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> while the shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from [...] "Hot Zone", with the CGI of the shield added on. When the producers conceived the idea for the space jump between Sheppard and Zelenka, they thought it would be [...] "cool", as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive. [...] However, the sequence was pulled off, and Paul Mullie described the jump as [...] "one of the best visual effects we have ever done." [...] The scene were one team dies from the collapsing shield however, was not performed as well as the producers hoped.|$|E
500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close,</b> Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is going to pick up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Weena shows George domed, well-like {{structures}} {{that dot the}} landscape: air shafts that double as access to the Morlock underworld. She takes him to an ancient museum where [...] "talking rings" [...] tell of a nuclear war in the distant past. A reduced population fought for survival in the poisoned landscape; many decided to live underground in permanent settlements, while some returned to the surface. George realises this {{was the beginning of}} speciation for the Morlocks and the Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens blare from atop the sphinx. He finds Weena gone and crowds of Eloi in a trance-like state, entering open doors at its base. The sirens stop and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... 16. Duet. The Queen warns Hamlet {{that he has}} {{offended}} his father, and she may be {{powerless to}} save his life (The Queen: Hamlet, ma douleur est immense! [...] "Hamlet, my grief is great!"). Hamlet asks, who has offended his father? She denies any understanding of his meaning. Hamlet blocks her attempt to leave, tries to force her to confront her guilt (Hamlet: Ah! que votre âme sans refuge pleure sur les devoirs trahis [...] "Ah! Let your defenseless heart weep over duties betrayed"). Hamlet leads his mother to the two portraits and points to the portrait of his father (Hamlet: Ici la grâce et la beauté sereines [...] "Here are grace and serene beauty"), then to the other portrait (Là, tous les crimes de la terre! [...] "There, all crimes of the earth!"). The Queen begs for mercy, kneeling before Hamlet (The Queen: Pardonne, hélas! ta voix m'accable! [...] Forgive me, alas! Your voice devastates me!"). The Queen collapses on a couch. The orchestra repeats the distinctive ostinato first heard in the Ramparts Scene as the accompaniment to Hamlet's aria (Spectre infernal!). The light dims, and the Ghost appears behind the couch, one arm extended toward Hamlet (Ghost: Mon fils! [...] "My son!"). Hamlet pulls back in confusion. The Ghost warns Hamlet (Ghost: Souviens-toi... mais épargne ta mère! [...] "Do not forget... but spare your mother!"). As the Ghost vanishes, the orchestra plays the theme of Hamlet's Promise, and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> themselves. Hamlet asks his mother not to think he is mad; his rage has calmed. He tells her to repent and sleep in peace, then leaves. She collapses {{at the foot of the}} prie-Dieu.|$|E
60|$|We heard <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> behind her, and {{the distant}} voices of those who bore her litter, then all was silence. Otomie listened at the window for a while, but the guards seemed to be gone, where or why I do not know to this hour, and {{the only sound was}} that of distant revelry from the camp.|$|E
60|$|And further I {{would go}} on to ask, is not this present {{exchange}} of Notes, appealing to the common sense of the world, really the beginning, and the proper beginning, of the unprecedented Peace Negotiations to end this unprecedented war?

60|$|Gwendolen {{took the}} packet {{and let it}} lie on her lap till she heard <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close.</b> It came into her mind that the packet might contain the {{diamonds}} which Grandcourt had spoken of as being deposited somewhere and {{to be given to}} her on her marriage. In this moment of confused feeling and creeping luxurious languor she was glad of this diversion--glad of such an event as having her own diamonds to try on.|$|E
60|$|I heard <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close,</b> and {{the sound}} of {{footsteps}} running and dying along the banquette, and after that my shoulders were raised and something wrapped about them. Then stillness again, the stillness that comes between waking and sleeping, between pain and calm. And at times when I felt her hand fall into mine or press against my brow, the pain seemed more endurable. After that I recall being lifted, being borne along. I opened my eyes once and saw, above a tile-crowned wall, the moon all yellow and distorted in the sky. Then a gate clicked, dungeon blackness, half-light again, ascent, oblivion.|$|E
60|$|There {{are three}} Masonic lodges and two Portuguese clubs, one good, the other not; {{and the former}} (Club Funchalense), well lodged in a house {{belonging}} to Viscountess Torre Bella, gives some twice {{or three times a}} year very enjoyable balls. The Café Central, with estaminet and French billiard-table, is much frequented by the youth of the town, but not by residents. The great institution is the club called the 'English Rooms,' which has been removed from over a shop in the Aljube to Viscondessa de Torre Bella's house in the Rua da Alfandega. The British Consulate is under the same roof, and next door is Messieurs Blandy's ubiquitous 'Steamer Agency.' The roomy and comfortable quarters, with a fine covered balcony looking out upon the sea, are open to both sexes. The collection of books is old; but the sum of 100l. laid out on works of reference would bring it fairly up {{to the level of the}} average English country-club. Strangers' names were hospitably put down by any proprietary member as guests and visitors if they did not outstay the fortnight; otherwise they became subscribers. But crowding was the result, and the term has been reduced to three days: a month's subscription, however, costs only 10s. 6d. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close</b> at 7.30 P.M.: I used to think this an old-world custom kept up by the veteran hands; but in an invalid place perhaps it is wisely done.|$|E

6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Mr. Brumley--they had {{met that}} day in Kensington Gardens and they were sitting side by side upon green chairs near the frozen {{writings}} of Physical Energy--"You see, if I may lecture a little, putting the thing as simply as possible, {{the world has been}} filling up new spaces ever since the discovery of America; all the period from then to about 1870, let us say, was a period of rapid increase of population in response to new opportunities of living and new fulnesses of life in every direction. During that time, four hundred years of it roughly, there was a huge development of family life; to marry and rear a quite considerable family became the chief business of everybody, celibacy grew rare, monasteries and nunneries which had abounded vanished like things dissolving in a flood and even the priests became Protestant against celibacy and took unto themselves wives and had huge families. The natural checks upon increase, famine and pestilence, were lifted by more systematized communication and by scientific discovery; and altogether and as a consequence the world now has probably three or four times the human population it ever carried before. Everywhere in that period the family prevailed again, the prospering multiplying household; it was a return to the family, to the reproductive social grouping of early barbaric life, and naturally all the thought of the modern world which has emerged since the fifteenth century falls into this form. So I see it, Lady Harman. The generation of our grandfathers in the opening nineteenth century had two shaping ideas, two forms of thought, the family and progress, not realizing that that very progress which had suddenly reopened the doors of opportunity for the family that had revived the ancient injunction to increase and multiply and replenish the earth, might presently close that door again and declare the world was filled. But that is what is happening now. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>close.</b> That immense swarming and multiplying of little people is over, and the forces of social organization have been coming into play now, more and more for a century and a half, to produce new wholesale ways of doing things, new great organizations, organizations that invade the autonomous family more and more, and are perhaps destined ultimately to destroy it altogether and supersede it. At least it is so I make my reading of history in these matters." ...|$|E
