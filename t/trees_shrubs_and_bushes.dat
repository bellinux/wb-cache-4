40|$|Autonomous robotic {{navigation}} in forested environments {{is difficult}} because of the highly variable appearance and geometric properties of the terrain. In most navigation systems, researchers assume a priori knowledge of the terrain appearance properties, geometric properties, or both. In forest environments, vegetation such as <b>trees,</b> <b>shrubs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> has appearance and geometric properties that vary with change of seasons, veg-etation age, and vegetation species. In addition, in forested environments the terrain surface is often rough, sloped, and/or covered with a surface layer of grass, vegetation, or snow. The complexity of the forest en-vironment presents difficult challenges for autonomous navigation systems. In this paper, a self-supervised sensing approach is introduced that attempts to robustly identify a drivable terrain surface for robots operat-ing in forested terrain. The sensing system employs both LIDAR and vision sensor data. There are three main stages in the system: feature learning, feature training, and terrain prediction. In the feature learning stage, 3 D range points from LIDAR are analyzed to obtain {{an estimate of the}} ground surface location. In the feature training stage, the ground surface estimate is used to train a visual classifier to discriminate between ground and nonground regions of the image. In the prediction stage, the ground surface location can be estimated at high frequency solely from vision sensor data. C © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 1...|$|E
40|$|From in situ {{measured}} woody cover {{we develop}} a phenology driven model {{to estimate the}} canopy cover of woody species in the Sahelian drylands at 1 km scale. The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept {{is based on the}} significant difference in phenophases of dryland <b>trees,</b> <b>shrubs</b> <b>and</b> <b>bushes</b> as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) — VEGETATION (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual FAPAR dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel. Both multi-year field data and satellite metrics are averaged to produce a steady map. Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r 2 /RMSE (in % woody cover) of 0. 73 / 3. 0 (MODIS) and 0. 70 / 3. 2 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD 44 B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of drylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.

Plans for the grove were largely complete by May 1975. Landscape architect Meade Palmer designed the grove, which included a contemplative meadow and a small granite plaza among some trees.

The Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas estimated the rock's age at a billion years. A flagstone walkway winding through the grove was included in the design. Four quotes from Johnson's public speeches, selected by Lady Bird Johnson, were carved into flagstones placed around the orthostat.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{research}} {{study was conducted}} in Mashuru Division of Kajiado District, Kenya with the objective of analyzing the types of vegetation degradation, their causes and their influence on rangeland condition and trend. The study was conducted through remote sensing tools, ground truthing, interviews, community workshop and literature. The results of the study showed that excessive use of the woody species by humans for woodfuel, building and fencing materials, medicine and ornamentals had led to the deterioration of the rangeland due to a loss of cover, change in plant composition and biodiversity. On the other hand, overgrazing and ecological succession of the grazing lands had led to further vegetation degradation in form of <b>bush</b> encroachment <b>and</b> thickening. These types of vegetation degradation have had an overall effect of loss of grass cover and hence loss of grazing capacity by livestock, especially cattle. The causes of vegetation decrease or increase over the last 30 years have been due to deforestation (<b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs),</b> <b>bush</b> encroachment <b>and</b> thickening, change in plant species composition and natural calamities such as droughts, wild fires and army worm invasions at various times.

En Colombia la ganader?a bovina se ha caracterizado por ser una actividad extractiva, donde la mayor parte del ?rea utilizada para pastizales y potreros es producto de la expansi?n de la frontera agr?cola, afect?ndose el equilibrio en t?rminos ambientales, productivos y socioecon?micos. Se considera hist?ricamente que es la actividad econ?mica m?s importante del sector agropecuario, sin embargo, el rezago tecnol?gico y el arraigo {{cultural}} de algunos productores no ha permitido desarrollarse. La generaci?n de gases con efecto invernadero en {{los animales}} rumiantes, tiene numerosos factores los cuales pueden estar relacionados con la especie animal, as? como con el tipo de alimentaci?n y las caracter?sticas de la dieta, los cuales van a determinar los patrones de fermentaci?n ruminal y de producci?n de gases por parte de los bovinos, ocasionando p?rdidas energ?ticas que derivan en p?rdidas econ?micas para los ganaderos de la regi?n. Por tal motivo el presente trabajo propone la recopilaci?n de algunas especies forrajeras, arb?reas y arbustivas con potencial sobre la disminuci?n de las emisiones de metano en ganado bovino, para que el productor lo utilice como herramienta alternativa que adem?s de mejorar sus ?ndices productivos, podr? dar un componente de sostenibilidad ambiental a sus unidades de producci?n, mediante la implementaci?n de las especies aqu? mencionadas, como banco de prote?na, cercas vivas o arboles dispersos en las praderas, dentro de un sistema silvopastoril en pro de mejorar las caracter?sticas y la eficiencia de la dieta como tambi?n conversar y preservar el medio ambiente.
