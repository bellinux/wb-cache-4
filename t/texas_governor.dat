Ferguson granted 1161 pardons in just two years.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} ashore, {{officials}} in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, advised residents in low-lying or flood-prone areas to consider {{moving to a}} safer location. A shelter was opened in Lake Charles, where 29people stayed during the storm. Flood watches and warnings were issued for portions of Mississippi and Louisiana as the storm tracked across the region. <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> Rick Perry, prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas, including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water rescue teams for search and rescue missions. The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in office, Ross {{proposed}} tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of propertyat that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> to call a special session of the legislature {{to deal with a}} treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} of turmoil, it was unclear who {{actually}} governed the colonies: Joseph I, the shadow government representing Ferdinand VII, the colonial officials, or revolutionaries in each province. The Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 at the instigation of Miguel Hidalgo. Fearing that the revolution would reach colonial <b>Texas,</b> <b>governor</b> Manuel María de Salcedo ordered the Texas borders closed to all foreigners. He was soon reversed by his uncle, the Commandant General. Revolutionaries soon overthrew and imprisoned Salcedo, and a new government was established in Texas. Salcedo persuaded Ignacio Elizondo (his jailer) {{to return to the}} royalist cause and the two organized a counter-coup. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was fatally shot while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{became the}} 19th {{governor}} of Texas. His inauguration ball {{was held at}} the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a tradition followed by every subsequent <b>Texas</b> <b>governor.</b> Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging, the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published {{on the front page of}} the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Ranger Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety {{is a law}} {{enforcement}} agency with statewide jurisdiction. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as riot police and as detectives, protected the <b>Texas</b> <b>governor,</b> tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by Stephen F. Austin in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history {{and some of the}} best-known criminal cases {{in the history of the}} Old West.|$|E
50|$|The Texas Education Agency (TEA) {{established}} the Office of Gifted and Talented Education in 1976 and developed {{the first state}} plan for Gifted Education in 1981 and funded the <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor's</b> Honors Program. From 1986 until 1988, the program {{was held at the}} University of Texas at Austin, and in 1989, the program was not held. The Texas Commissioner of Education Dr. Tom Kirby asked Dr. Sisk at Lamar University to plan and develop a Governor’s Honors Program, and from 1990-1999 the <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Honors Program was held at Lamar. Funding from the Texas Education Agency was withdrawn for 2000-2002; however, Lamar University decided to continue the program by seeking funding from private foundations and individual donors to support the program; and the program was renamed the Texas Honors Leadership Program. In 2008, once again under funding by the TEA, the program reemerged as the <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor's</b> School. As of 2010, there are 4 Governor's School programs in the state of Texas.|$|R

5|$|The first {{refining}} {{operations at}} Corsicana were built by Joseph S. Cullinan, a former manager for Standard Oil in Pennsylvania. His company, which was later absorbed by Magnolia Petroleum Company and then acquired by Standard Oil of New York, {{built the first}} modern refinery west of the Mississippi River. Following the strike at Spindletop, Cullinan partnered with Arnold Schlaet to form the Texas Fuel Company in Beaumont with funding from an investment group run by former <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> James S. Hogg and other investors. In 1905, as the new company rapidly expanded its operations, it moved its corporate headquarters to Houston. The company's strength {{in the oil industry}} established Houston as the center of the industry in Texas. The company was later absorbed into the Texas Company and then renamed Texaco.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{believed}} that the nation {{was on the verge}} of major political change, and that he could be elected president in 1896, uniting the silver supporters of the South and West. He was willing to consider a third party bid if Cleveland kept control of the Democratic Party, but felt the Populists, by allowing African Americans to seek office, had destroyed their credibility among southern whites. The stinging oratory of the South Carolina senator brought him national prominence, and with the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago likely to be controlled by silver supporters, Tillman was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate along with others, such as former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland, <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> James Hogg, and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|When Texas seceded {{from the}} United States {{and joined the}} Confederacy, Ross joined the Confederate States Army.

Following the Civil War, Ross briefly served as sheriff of McLennan County before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention. With the exception of a two-year term as a state senator, Ross spent the next decade focused on his farm and ranch concerns. In 1887, he became the 19th governor of Texas. During his two terms, he oversaw the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol, resolved the Jaybird-Woodpecker War, and became the only <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> to call a special session to deal with a treasury surplus.|$|E
