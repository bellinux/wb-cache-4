This reaction against the team was originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s when many of Santa Fe's best players were transferred to América de Cali with little economic compensation, and in the end favored América with obtaining various titles. In the 1999 edition of Copa Merconorte, these two teams faced each other in the final; América lost 2–1 in Cali and then went to Bogotá and won 1–0. The game was decided by penalty shootouts, where América obtained its first international title.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts {{can be used in}} high-performance engines.|$|E

25|$|Bacteria may {{secondarily}} colonize the socket, {{and lead}} to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors {{to the loss of}} the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become necrotic. The necrotic bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more serious condition.|$|E

500|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} another potential source for the lead may have been the ships' fresh-water systems rather than the tinned food. K.T.H. Farrer argued that [...] "it is impossible to see how one could ingest from the canned food the amount of lead, 3.3mg per day over eight months, required to raise the PbB to the level 80μg/dL at which symptoms of lead poisoning begin to appear in adults and the suggestion that bone lead in adults could be 'swamped' by lead ingested from food over a period of a few months, or even three years, seems scarcely tenable." [...] In addition, tinned food was in widespread use within the Royal Navy at that time and its use did not lead to any significant increase in lead poisoning elsewhere. However, and uniquely for this expedition only, the ships were fitted with converted railway locomotive engines for auxiliary propulsion which required an estimated one tonne of fresh water per hour when steaming. It is highly probable that it was for this reason that the ships were fitted with a unique water distillation system which, given the materials in use at the time, would have produced large quantities of water with a very high lead content. William Battersby has argued that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more likely source for the high levels of lead observed in the remains of expedition members than the tinned food.|$|E
