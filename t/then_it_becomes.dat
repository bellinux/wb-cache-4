The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street until it reaches Ferry. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> ragged and irregular, reaching the district's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District.

5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E

25|$|All three Houses {{fight against}} the Guild in a race against time to destroy the Emperor Worm before it awakens, with a {{different}} ending for each House depicting their units destroying the Worm. One such ending reveals that, from {{the wreckage of the}} Emperor Worm's scaffold, red eyes are glowing in the dark, which perhaps suggests that the Worm survives. Should the player fail to defeat the Emperor Worm, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> crowned as the new leader of the Empire of Man.|$|E
25|$|Note that Game Value is {{dependent}} {{not only on}} the cards held (including the Skat) but also on which game is being declared and the outcome of the play. Each holding can thus be evaluated differently by different players. A risk-taking player might be willing to declare Hand on a holding on which another player might not — these two players will therefore give different valuations to the same holding. However, after all tricks have been played, it is always possible to determine the exact Game Value by combining the actual holding with the type of game and outcome of the play. Only <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> apparent if declarer has won or lost (if he overbid).|$|E

25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, {{there are two types}} of fuel. The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} a large amount of energy and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second type of fuel is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a fissile isotope by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> an entrainment defect.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the advent}} of laser technology, {{coherent}} radio sources were used for interferometry measurements {{of the speed of}} light. However interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became NIST). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a [...] fractional uncertainty of [...]|$|E

2500|$|The passive {{has both}} periphrastic and {{morphological}} means of expression.

Thus lakhvũ [...] "to write" [...] → lakhvāmā āvvũ, lakhāvũ [...] "to be written". The post-position thī marks the agent, As in other New Indo-Aryan languages, formation of passives is not restricted to transitive verbs and has a restricted domain of usage except in special registers. Both intransitive and transitive may be grammatically passivized to show capacity, in place of compounding with the modal śakvũ [...] "to be able". Lastly, intransitives often have a passive sense, or convey unintentional action.|$|E

2500|$|The second common {{misconception}} is {{that all}} out-of-court statements are hearsay. This is not the case.

[...] If the attorney is seeking to use this statement to prove that it was in fact raining in Vermont, then it is hearsay. But, if the attorney is seeking to use the statement to prove that the phone lines were working that day, or that Jim had not lost the power of speech, or for any other purpose, then the statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and therefore it is not hearsay.|$|E
