5|$|In the past, the {{decision}} to allow athletes to return <b>to</b> <b>participation</b> was frequently based on the grade of concussion. However, current research and recommendations by professional organizations including the National Athletic Trainers' Association recommend against such use of these grading systems. Currently, injured athletes are prohibited from returning to play before they are symptom-free during both rest and exertion and until results of the neuropsychological tests have returned to pre-injury levels.|$|E

40|$|In recent {{developments}} in political and legal philosophy, {{there is a tendency}} to endorse minimalist lists of human rights which do not include a right <b>to</b> political <b>participation.</b> Against such tendencies, I shall argue that the right <b>to</b> political <b>participation,</b> understood as distinct from a right to democracy, should have a place even on minimalist lists. In addition, I shall defend the need to extend the right <b>to</b> political <b>participation</b> <b>to</b> include <b>participation</b> not just in national, but also in international and global governance processes. The argument will be based on a cosmopolitan conception of political legitimacy and on a political conception of human rights that is normatively anchored in legitimacy. The central claim of my paper is that a right <b>to</b> political <b>participation</b> is necessary – but not sufficient – for political legitimacy in the global realm...|$|R

5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due <b>to</b> <b>participation</b> by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion and the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E

25|$|Other {{researchers}} have investigated {{to what extent}} these behavioral economic lab experiments on social preferences can be generalized to behavior in the field.

These shrimpers cut a hole in the bottom of their fishing bucket in order to allow immature shrimp to escape, thereby investing in the public good of the shared shrimp population. The size of the hole {{can be seen as the}} degree to which participants cooperate, as larger holes allow more shrimp to escape. Controlling for a number of other possible influences, Fehr and Leibbrandt demonstrated a positive relationship between hole size and contributions in the public goods game experiment.|$|E

In 2010 Caricom Heads of Government went a step further to facilitate travel by Haitian businesses persons and agreed that Haitians possessing US and Schengen visas would not require visas to enter other Caricom member states. In regards <b>to</b> <b>participation</b> in the free movement of skilled nationals, Haiti has also been included in the relevant legislation of at least some CSME states as a participating member state.|$|E
