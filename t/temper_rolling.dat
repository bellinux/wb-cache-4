40|$|AbstractTemper rolling is a {{fundamental}} process applied in steel industries to improve the tensile properties of sheet steels by eliminating discontinuous yield behaviours. Virtually evaluating the effects of <b>temper</b> <b>rolling</b> mechanics on eliminating discontinuity is still a crucial problem {{due to a lack}} of comprehensive constitutive material models that correctly describe this elimination mechanism. In this paper, modified anisotropic constitutive model based on Hill's 48 yield criterion are used for finite element analysis (FEA) of the <b>temper</b> <b>rolling</b> process. This model was applied for four different sheet thicknesses and the FEA results are compared with experimental results obtained directly from the production line. According to the results, the customized model that implements the modified anisotropic yielding criterion efficiently describes the tensile behaviour of low carbon steels following <b>temper</b> <b>rolling,</b> and it more accurately predicts the lower and upper yielding points than the isotropic yielding criterion. This model thus assists to facilitate the simulation, optimization and prediction of mechanical properties following <b>temper</b> <b>rolling...</b>|$|E

40|$|Residual {{stress is}} the stress that remains stored within a {{structure}} {{as a result}} of its manufacturing history. Often called a locked in stress, it remains when there is no applied load, influences the applied load and changes the structure's expected response to stress. An example of this is that a tensile residual stress will add to an applied tensile load, increasing the maximum tensile stress. Conversely when a compressive load is applied, a tensile residual stress reduces the maximum compressive stress. Residual stress develops in a part during all stages of manufacturing through the action of plastic deformation and thermal inhomogeneities. The final residual stress within a structure can be a combination of the residual stresses created through these stages. Processes that produce significant residual stress in steels include quenching and <b>tempering,</b> <b>rolling,</b> bending and welding. Due to the highly localised thermal input at the weld point, welding produces the largest short range variation in residual stress field. In the immediate region of a weld, the residual stress is dominated by the residual stress from the welding processes: tensile stress in the weld region, becoming compressive further from the weld. Prior residual stress fields can influence the expansion and contraction and thus the final welded residual stress profile. Because residual stress acts on a scale that interacts with applied stresses, it becomes important to know what residual stress is present within a component in order to know the final load acting on the structure. In many situations it is not possible to determine the residual stress within a component directly and an approximation, or best practice, residual stress profile must be used. This can be simple, for example considering the residual stress produced by bending, but the residual stress profile produced in welding is a great deal more complex, depending on weld thickness, geometry, restraint, heat input and is difficult to accurately predict. It is important to have a highly accurate prediction of the residual stress when carrying out processes such as an Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) since this will determine the integrity of a welded joint in its environment. An ECA uses a combination of the applied stress and the residual stress profiles in order to determine the likelihood of growth of a flaw at a particular point in the structure. The residual stress profiles used to make these assessments are conservative and in the case of steel T -butt welds are based on a very narrow range of heat inputs and welding processes. The typical residual stress profile is assumed to be highly tensile which means that an ECA on any flaws in the weld region will indicate potential failure of the welded joint and repair is necessary. One of the factors that may affect the conservatism of these residual stress profiles is the lack of consideration of the overall interaction of the residual stress fields prior to welding. This work experimentally measures the residual stress fields in thick steel plate before and after welding, in both restrained and unrestrained plate, and uses this to consider whether the residual stresses are a result of welding or pre-welding processes and examines how these influence the final residual stress field. The work allows a new consideration of what residual stress fields around highly restrained, thick section welds are: creating a basis for pre-existing residual stress fields to be considered in conjunction with the welding residual stress in ECAs.

40|$|Abstract. Use of ultra-high-strength steels (UHSS) {{in weight}} {{critical}} constructions {{is an effective}} way to save energy and minimize carbon footprint in the end use.

This has led to development of energy efficient direct quenching (DQ) steelmaking process {{as an alternative to the}} conventional quenched and <b>tempered</b> or thermomechanical <b>rolling</b> and accelerate cooled processes. Ruukki has employed thermomechanical rolling and direct quenching process (TM + DQ) for a novel type of ultra-high-strength strip and plate steels since 2001. Advantages of the ultra-high-strength level (> 900 MPa) can be fully utilized only if fabricated properties are on a sufficient level. Bending is one of the most important workshop processes and a good bendability is essential for a structural steel. Hence, the metallurgy and bendability of Ruukki´s TM + DQ strip steel Optim ® 960 QC have been investigated closely. It was found that by optimizing process parameters and chemical composition, a good combination of strength and ductility can be achieved by a modification of martensitic-bainitic microstructure. Despite of smaller total elongation, the bendability of Optim ® 960 QC is at least on the same level as on conventionally manufactured 960 MPa steels. However, it is important to pay special attention to bending process (tool parameters, springback, bending force, material handling) when bending UHSS.

40|$|High {{strength}} steels (HSS) {{have specific}} chemical compositions, which primarily depend on <b>rolling</b> <b>tempering</b> techniques, element thickness and the producer. Nonetheless, EN 1993 - 1 - 12 related to HSS up to S 700 grade {{does not provide}} any additional note {{on the design of}} steel structures subjected to fire and the designer is referred to EN 1993 - 1 - 2 valid up to S 460 grade. This paper presents the results of a numerical analysis on the behaviour at elevated temperature of Circular Hollow Sections (CHS) columns made of HSS. In details, three full-scale HSS CHS columns with average measured yield strength of 822 MPa and 3. 15 m long were tested under the standard ISO fire with constant eccentric compression load. Two members were made of a cross section 323. 9 mm x 10 mm and one of a cross section 355. 6 mm x 12 mm. The constant applied loads during the tests were respectively equal to 10 %, 14 % and 19 % of the axial capacity of the columns at ambient temperature. Then, a nonlinear thermomechanical finite element model made of solid elements was developed by means of ABAQUS. A fully-coupled analysis using Geometrically and Materially Nonlinear Imperfect Analysis (GMNIA) was employed meaning that the temperature field was determined together with the stress-displacement fields. The calibration of the numerical model was carried out against experimental data by exploiting the thermal and the mechanical properties of steel provided in EN 1993 - 1 - 2. A sensitivity analysis was performed to highlight the main parameters that affect the simulation results, i. e. mesh size, residual stresses, geometrical imperfections etc. The calibration process showed a good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental outcomes both in terms of failure temperature and of failure mode. With the calibrated model, it was finally possible to perform a preliminary parametric analysis by varying the applied load and the column relative slenderness to assess the appropriateness of the buckling curve included in EN 1993 - 1 - 2 to predict the fire resistance of HSS CHS columns.

40|$|A {{range of}} HSLA steels {{reflecting}} {{the two major}} processing routes, quench and <b>tempering</b> and controlled <b>rolling,</b> have been tested in fatigue to assess their potential wider application in the offshore Industry. The six steels chosen have {{a wide range of}} yield strenghts (470 to 690 Nmm- 2), fracture toughness (31 to 260 J at - 40 °C) and carbon equivalent values (0. 19 to 0. 33). Fatigue testing has in general been carried out at low frequency (0. 5 Hz) and high load ratio (0. 6) however some tests have been conducted at very low frequency (0. 1 Hz) and low load ratio (0. 1). An in-air study was first used to assess the fatigue performance of all six parent plates. Five steels were welded by the Submerged Arc Welding process at high heat input (1. 5 kJmm - 1) to evaluate the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) fatigue performance. A new test was devised to grow a fatigue crack through a single pass, bead on plate-, HAZ whilst maintaining a constant stress intensity range. The surface crack length was continuously monitored and recorded to an accuracy of 0. 01 mm. A corrosion fatigue study evaluated the performance of one controlled rolled and one quenched and tempered steel at three levels of impressed current cathodic protection. Extensive metallographic examination was made to study the influence of microstructural features and types on fatigue crack propagation. Techniques used include optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fatigue crack and surface replication and crack profile digitising. These techniques give an assessment of crack path deviation and branching, the influence of precipitates and inclusions, and an indication of the mode of fatigue crack propagation. The wide range of microalloyed HSLA steels tested have shown a significant improvement in fatigue crack propagation resistance over structural steels conforming to BS 4360 grade 50 D. Typically an improvement by a factor of two has been observed. Whilst the observed increase in fatigue life was slightly reduced by high heat input welding the slope of the Paris curves remained unaffected thus indicating a similar stress intensity range sensitivity in the HAZ to that shown by the parent plate. The newly developed crack monitoring system coupled to a computer controlled fatigue testing machine has shown a wide variation in fatigue crack propagation rates through a heat affected zone microstructural gradient. Growth rates have increased by a factor of ten in localised coarse grained microstructural regions compared to the adjacent weld metal and outer heat affected zone. The corrosion fatigue study has also indicated that in general HSLA steels retain their superiour fatigue resistance compared to structural steels and in particular respond more favourably to cathodic protection. Both in-air and corrosion fatigue studies have indicated that the controlled rolled steel microstructures developed mainly for line pipe application has the greatest potential for increased use offshore...|$|R

The process combines of 3 stages: metallurgical annealing, zinc coating deposition & <b>temper</b> <b>rolling.</b> Due to manual operation at zinc coating area, zinc consumption is higher & coating weight thickness is uncertain. Moreover, manual interventions, varying with the operative personnel, inevitably resulted in coating thickness fluctuations & out of range coatings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify & understand the parameters which affect the coating thickness over CR coil. The dependent variable, zinc coating weight is used as a measure of profitability. Relation between the dependent & independent variable helps in identifying the critical parameter or group of parameters which directly affects the process & ultimately final product. The current data recorded, examined & analyzed for deciding the criticality of independent variables over the dependent one. A strong significant relationship between coating weight control & profitability has been found in previous empirical work. This research work is aimed at analyzing the effect of process parameters on consumption of zinc in continuous galvanizing line thereby calculating the exact set of parameters to decide the actual coating thickness required.

40|$|Roll forming is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry to form High Strength Steel (HSS) and Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for structural components. Because of the large variety of applications of roll forming in the industry, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is increasingly}} utilized for roll forming process design. Bending is the dominant deformation mode in roll forming and sheet materials used in the process are often temper rolled (skin passed), roller- or tension-levelled. These processes introduce residual stresses into the material, and {{recent studies have shown}} that those affect the material behaviour in bending. A thickness reduction rolling process available at Deakin that leads to material deformation similar to an industrial <b>temper</b> <b>rolling</b> operation was used in this study to introduce residual stresses into a dual phase, DP 780, steel strip. The initial and thickness reduced strips were then used in a 5 -stand experimental V-section roll forming set-up to identify the effect of residual stress on the final shape. The influence of residual stress and the effect of plastic deformation on the material behaviour in roll forming are separately determined in numerical simulation. The results show that the thickness reduction rolling process decreases the maximum bow height while the springback angle and end flare increase. Comparison with experimental results shows that using material data from the conventional tensile test in a numerical simulation does not allow for the accurate prediction of shape defects in a roll forming process if a residual stress profile exists in the material. On the other hand including the residual stress information leads to improved model accuracy...|$|E
40|$|For every mill {{the ideal}} roll can be {{considered}} as one {{that can be used in}} a mill stand indefinitely. Unfortunately for the roll user, such ideal rolls do not exist. One major reason for work roll changes (planned or unplanned) is "wear". In the context of cold rolling and <b>temper</b> <b>rolling,</b> "wear" primarily refers to loss of roughness and/or surface texture. Another limitation to roll performance is the fact that mill incidents - minor as well as major incidents - inflict damage on the work rolls, requiring redressing in the roll shop. If a major defect is present in a forged roll, e. g. due to a mill incident, catastrophic roll failure may occur in a violent, explosive manner. Improvement of the value-in-use of a work roll implies a superior wear resistance, a superior damage resistance, and elimination of the safety risks associated with explosive roll failures. In order to deal with this in a concerted R&D approach, a consortium of two roll users in the steel industry, a leading roll manufacturer, a high-tech supplier of roll damage detection equipment, and specialised research institutes have joined forces. Cold rolling trials have been performed, using pilot mills as well as industrial mills, with both novel forged HSS work rolls and conventional forged 3 - 5 %Cr steel work rolls. Separate trials have been designed to focus on either the aspect of roughness evolution or damage resistance. Complementary data from various laboratory tests and industrial mill and roll shop data have been collected. Models have been developed for damage evolution in a roll, and for roughness evolution of the roll surface. In addition, novel non-destructive detection systems and sensors have been designed and tested. This paper provides a concise overview of the results achieved. © EDP Sciences...|$|E
40|$|The {{threat to}} future {{legislation}} regarding fuel consumption and emission {{has forced the}} automotive industry to develop lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The two main objectives of this industry are the reduction in car weight and improvement in safety. To achieve this, most of the panels {{that make up the}} car bodies prefer high strength materials coupled with better formability. The performances of conventional high strength steels are not sufficient. It has been found out that bake hardenable steel sheets are an excellent solution to the above problem. These steels offer good formability (low yield strength for good shape fixability) during press operations and also higher final yield strength during paint baking operations for good dent resistance. Paint bake hardening is essentially the strain aging increment found after forming and aging for 20 minutes at 180 °C. It is commonly assumed in the steel industry that the carbon and nitrogen in solution in the ferrite at the time of paint bake hardening is responsible for the bake hardening strengthening increment observed. However, numerous studies have shown that there is little correlation between the interstitial solute level and the measured paint bake hardening responseIt was tried to develop ultra low carbon steel that can provide a consistent BH increment of 100 MPa, while retaining good formability. It is to maximize the paint bake hardening increment in ultra low carbon, high strength steel sheets in a consistent and reproducible manner and hence to obtain cost savings in steel plants from improved product yieldThe focus was to develop criteria for bake hardening based on the fundamental understanding of the interaction between the strain sources- <b>temper</b> <b>rolling</b> and pre- strain, interstitial character and content, and the bake hardening time-temperature response. Characterization of the grain boundary distribution, and hence establishing a correlation between the grain boundary hardening, segregation of interstitial solutes and the grain boundary mis-orientation have been established. This will tend to improve our {{understanding of the nature of}} the ferrite or final microstructure on the BH response. The processing condition dependence of the segregation of carbon in low carbon bake hardenable steel, taking account of the variation of the segregation on the individual grain boundaries and to elucidate the relation between the grain boundary segregation and the crystallographic orientation of grain boundaries is also accomplished. The successful completion of this program will result in large energy savings for steel plants and in the transportation sector...|$|E
40|$|Nonoriented {{electrical}} steels {{are mainly}} {{used as the}} core materials in motors and generators. The magnetic properties required for these materials are low core loss, high magnetic induction and high magnetic permeability. These magnetic properties of nonoriented electrical steels are mainly influenced by grain size and crystallographic texture. All research to improve the magnetic properties so far has focused on grain growth through the control of chemical compositions and various processing parameters. However, in the manufacturing techniques of nonoriented electrical steels, the control of grain size is approaching its limit. Since there is still enough room to improve the magnetic properties through the control of texture, future research in nonoriented electrical steels should be concentrated on the optimization of crystallographic texture. Recrystallization texture itself {{has long been a}} subject of research because the origin of recrystallization texture provides a high level of scientific interest. Despite much research on recrystallization texture, the mechanism of the formation of recrystallization texture is still disputed. This dispute is associated with the complexity of microstructural inhomogeneity formed in the deformed state, different nucleation rates for different orientations of deformed grains and different growth rates of nuclei into the neighboring deformed matrix. However, the advent of Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) has contributed to a remarkable progress in the area of recrystallization texture, and stimulated research on the annealing texture in low carbon and interstitial free steels. Conversely, no systematic research on the evolution of the annealing texture in nonoriented electrical steels has yet been done. The mechanism of texture evolution during recrystallization in the nonoriented electrical steels containing 1 % and 2 % Si respectively, a main objective of this thesis, is investigated from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements on the materials with different recrystallization fractions. Based on obtained results, the mechanism for the formation of the recrystallization texture is proposed. The behavior of deformed grains of specific orientations is also discussed in terms of image quality value introduced by EBSD techniques. In addition, the origin of nuclei of specific orientations is suggested from observed EBSD results. The texture development during grain growth, another main objective of this thesis, is investigated. Furthermore, a mechanism of texture development during grain growth is proposed based on the misorientation angle distribution with adjacent grains and the average size of grains of specific orientations. Some useful means to optimize the magnetic properties through texture control in nonoriented electrical steels are studied. The effect of initial grain size prior to cold rolling on texture evolution during both the recrystallization stage and the grain growth stage is clarified. In addition, the effects of <b>temper</b> <b>rolling</b> reduction and annealing time on texture development during final annealing are examined. A mechanism of texture transformation by strain induced boundary migration (SIBM) is suggested by means of the introduction of image quality value in EBSD techniques. Finally, the effect of heating rate on texture development during final annealing is investigated, and the reason for texture change due to different heating rates is discussed...|$|E
