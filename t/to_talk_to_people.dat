5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The next day, on 6 November, {{people kept}} protesting, {{although}} in fewer numbers (6,000 in Bucharest and several thousands in other cities). The president told the civil representatives {{that he will}} come incognito <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> in the streets, indirectly hinting that if they want true change they need to keep asking for it so the politicians can't pretend they don't understand what is asked of them.|$|E
25|$|After {{converting}} to Christianity, Chick wanted to evangelize others, {{but he was}} too shy <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> directly about religion. Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E

25|$|At an {{altitude}} of 400 feet above ground level, First Officer Poe suddenly spotted the Swift under the fuselage of the DC-6 {{but was unable to}} take evasive action, and the two aircraft collided. The airliner's flight crew continued the approach and landed without incident; the DC-6 was almost completely unscathed except for some minor damage to a fuselage-mounted radio antenna and the No. 4 propeller. Capt. Woolweaver never clearly saw the other airplane and was unsure what had happened until the airliner had landed and he was able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who had witnessed the collision.|$|E
25|$|The Romanovs {{were placed}} in the Napolnaya School, on the fringe of the town. The school was small, {{consisting}} of only six rooms, the furniture basic but scanty. Each prisoner received an iron bed. They were allowed to move into the desolate former schoolrooms and sort out their living arrangements on their own. Grand Duke Sergei shared a room with Feodor Remez and Prince Paley. Although the captives were under the strict guard of the Red Army soldiers, they were allowed to walk in town, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> and to go to church on feasts days. Preparing to spend a long time in Alapayevsk, they planted flowers and vegetable gardens near the school and spent many hours working there. On rainy days, the Romanovs read Russian novels to each other. Gradually, the regimen toughened and they were forbidden to take walks. The school was encircled with a barbed-wire fence and small trenches. Two weeks later, they were murdered.|$|E
500|$|People with AS {{may not be}} as {{withdrawn}} around others, {{compared with}} those with other, more debilitating forms of autism; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction. This social awkwardness has been called [...] "active but odd". This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive. However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display selective mutism, speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose only <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> they like.|$|E

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E

[...] Bailey has denied that it is unethical for a university professor <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> in the same manner that journalists do, or to write books with the resulting anecdotes.

2500|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, {{on the other side}} of the Bay of Naples about [...] from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of {{the eruption}}. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E

5000|$|GamePro {{commented that}} the story, stylistics, and general {{progression}} of Vay are generic and forgettable, but that the game is overall worthwhile for the sole reason of its intelligent dialogue. They elaborated that [...] "you actually look forward <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> - not simply {{to see what they}} have to say, but how they say it. ... It's not really literature (you wouldn't buy it if it were a book, and you can't really quote it without sounding silly), but it's mature and serious enough to acquire its own urgency, and funny in a way that even adults will appreciate." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly also criticized the story as generic and unoriginal, but concluded that the large game world, numerous playable characters, and [...] "excellent" [...] cinemas would ensure that the game appeals to RPG fans. They gave it a 5.4 out of 10.|$|R
