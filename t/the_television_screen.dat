25|$|Later, the FCC {{determined}} which teleport uplink sites {{out of the}} 2,000 licensed transmitters in the United States had {{the capability}} to override the HBO signal. That narrowed it down to 580 uplink sites that had sufficiently large antennas that had the capability of broadcasting the signal. The manufacturer that produced the character generator graphics model used to generate the typeface on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen</b> was also identified after studying footage of the jamming. Tape machines were not running during the jamming, but investigators from the commission obtained copies from an FCC engineer and HBO viewers. The FCC removed stations {{from the list of}} 500 that were inoperative on April 27 or transmitting other material. This method brought the number of potential stations down to twelve. After FCC investigators visited these stations, there were now three prime suspects which included MacDougall. The commission later learned an accountant from Wisconsin had overheard MacDougall bragging about the jamming at a payphone in a rest area off Interstate 75 in Gainesville, and obtained a license plate number of a car owned by MacDougall.|$|E

500|$|The {{seeds for}} the {{animated}} adaptation of The Kampung Boy were sown in 1993 {{in a conversation}} between Lat and Ananda Krishman, founder of Measat Broadcast Network Systems.

[...] Recognising that the younger generation preferred colourful animations over static black and white drawings, Lat was keen for a local animated series to promote local values among Malaysian children. [...] After Krishnan's company offered Lat financial support to start an animation project, the cartoonist began plans to adapt his trademark comic to <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

[...] Awareness of the holiday spread thanks to social media, with #GalentinesDay trended on Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr on February 13th 2017, seven years after the original episode aired. While Galentine’s Day started out with Leslie Knope going to brunch with her female friends, the holiday is not just celebrated by fans of the show, becoming {{more than just a}} plot point in an episode.

500|$|The {{character}} of Victor {{has been used}} as a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers and appeared in an advert for it. The commercials aired in November 1998. In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen,</b> praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign [...] "has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community – and small wonder. Not only does it perform the considerable task of balancing an affordability message with strong branding, it does so in a category seldom noted for the quality of strategic thinking that goes into its advertising." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, a live-action Batman {{television}} show debuted to high ratings. Like pop art, the show took comic-book tropes and re-envisioned {{them in the}} context of a different medium. Voiceover narration in each episode articulated the words of comic-book captions while fight scenes had sound effects like [...] "Biff", [...] "Bam" [...] and [...] "Pow" [...] appear as visual effects on the screen, spelled out in large cartoon letters. Circulation for comic books in general and Batman merchandise in particular soared. Other masked or superpowered adventurers appeared on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen,</b> so that [...] "American TV in the winter of 1967 appeared to consist of little else but live-action and animated cartoon comic-book heroes, all in living colour." [...] Existing comic-book publishers began creating superhero titles, as did new publishers. By the end of the 1960s, however, the fad had faded; in 1969, the best-selling comic book in the United States was not a superhero series, but the teen-humor book Archie.|$|E
500|$|Brown based {{the game}} and its {{characters}} on the Conan the Barbarian series, having read all of Robert E Howard's stories of the eponymous warrior. [...] He conceptualised 16moves and practised them with wooden swords, filming his sessions as references for the game's animation. [...] One move, the Web of Death, was copied from the 1984 sword and sorcery film Conan the Destroyer. [...] Spinning the sword like a propeller, Brown [...] "nearly took [...] eye out" [...] when he practised the move. [...] Playing back the videos, the team traced each frame of action onto clear plastic sheets laid over <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> [...] The tracings were transferred on a grid that helped the team map the swordplay images, pixel by pixel, to a digital form. [...] Brown refused to follow the convention of using small sprites to represent the fighters in the game, forcing the coders to conceive a method to animate larger blocks of graphics: Palace Software's co-founder Richard Leinfellner said they [...] "multiplexed the sprites and had different look-up tables for different frames." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{is because}} of this that he is {{credited}} alongside the likes of Lowe, Eric Bristow, Bob Anderson, Jocky Wilson, Cliff Lazarenko and now Phil Taylor as bringing darts to the masses via <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screens.</b> He had a good record on Bullseye, scoring more than 301 with nine darts {{on at least two}} appearances in six and thus having his charity money doubled.|$|R
500|$|The most {{important}} casting decision {{was that of}} the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers. Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that [...] "he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it." [...] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left. Burns himself stated, [...] "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the family, except for Marge, {{watching}} a parody of the show Dinosaurs on television. The staff thought Dinosaurs was a knock-off of The Simpsons, so at one point Bart exclaims [...] "It's like they saw our lives and put it right on screen," [...] and points at <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> Before she reveals to the Simpson family that Selma's new boyfriend is Bob, Patty says there is something [...] "disturbing" [...] about him, which results in Lisa imagining him as being The Elephant Man. As Bob remembers his time in prison, a scene with him picking up road side trash is seen, referencing the film Cool Hand Luke. The music in the scene is {{a reference to the}} soundtrack of the film as well. Bob also remembers winning a Daytime Emmy Award in the [...] "Best Supporting Performer in a Children's Program" [...] category. In Selma's letters to Sideshow Bob, she refers to him by his prison number, 24601, which is Jean Valjean's prisoner number in the novel Les Misérables. The reunion between Krusty and Bob at the telethon is a reference to a surprise reunion between former comedy partners Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on a 1970s telethon. The telethon logo features an Al Hirschfeld-style caricature of Krusty.|$|E
500|$|The {{computers}} seen in {{the internet}} cafe that the Simpsons visit {{in the beginning of}} the episode are based on the Apple iMac computers. In a scene inside Flanders' kitchen, a note which reads [...] "1 COR 6:9-11" [...] can be seen. This refers to the Bible, First Corinthian, chapter 6, verses 9 to 11: [...] "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." [...] The cups in the 33 cent store read That '70s Show, a reference which Danny Masterson, one of the lead actors in That '70s Show, was entertained by, according to Scully. Battling Seizure Robots, the seizure-inducing television show that the Simpsons watch in their hotel room, is based on an episode of Pokémon, called [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon", which caused 685 children to develop epileptic seizures. According to Scully, the staff received [...] "several angry letters" [...] from people for the scene. After the cartoon, an advertisement for Mr. Sparkle, a character that first appeared in the season 8 episode [...] "In Marge We Trust", can be seen on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screen.</b> Barney, while impersonating Homer, says [...] "That boy ain't right", a line frequently used by Hank Hill, the main character of the animated television series King of the Hill. The giant monsters attacking at the end of the episode are Godzilla, Gamera, Rodan and Mothra, all of which are famous from Japanese monster movies. The scene was included as a reference to the 1998 action science fiction film Godzilla, in which three of the main The Simpsons cast members (Azaria, Cartwright and Shearer) had a live-action role.|$|E
5000|$|Teletubbies is a British pre-school children's {{television}} series created by Ragdoll Productions' Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport.

Recognised throughout popular culture for the uniquely-shaped antenna {{protruding from the}} heads of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to young children.|$|R

5000|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{to accompany the}} single [...] "Famous" [...] was released on the band's website and YouTube on 23 April 2010, 2 {{months prior to the}} release of the actual single.

Stride is then seen reading the owner's manual to <b>the</b> various <b>television</b> <b>screens</b> positioned in <b>the</b> apartment, which refers to the lyric: [...] "I've got 900 channels, but there's nothing to see". The band then perform the single, all the while recording themselves, before placing a video cassette in the video player, resulting in the performance being shown on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> sets. <b>The</b> celebrities named in the video, including Bette Davis and James Dean are all shown on <b>the</b> <b>television</b> <b>screens</b> at various points throughout the video.|$|R
