5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> {{asked if they had}} enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|It {{continued}} to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This {{is believed to}} be due to its proximity <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A {{strengthening}} {{ridge to}} the south turned the storm {{to the south}}west, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to downgrade Gillian to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Erick brought minor {{impact to}} the western {{coastline}} of Mexico in July2013. The fifth tropical cyclone and named storm, {{as well as the}} fourth hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Erick originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on June18. The wave tracked swiftly westward with little development, emerging into the eastern Pacific on July1. As a result of favorable environmental conditions, the wave developed into a tropical depression on July4, and further into Tropical Storm Erick at 0000UTC on July5. Steered generally west-northwest, Erick intensified into a Category1 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) on July6. Its proximity <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm the following day, though it remained at such intensity until degenerating into a remnant low early on July9. The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later, southwest of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999, about 20 SBS {{members were}} {{involved}} in the Australian led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in East Timor. Together with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service they formed INTERFET's special forces element named Response Force. Response Force departed from Darwin by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and flew into Dili tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> deploy with the SBS filmed driving a Land Rover Defender out of a Hercules. Response Force was then utilised to perform to a variety of tasks including direct action and special reconnaissance throughout East Timor. The British forces withdrew in December 1999, including the SBS. A Sergeant was awarded the Military Cross after his patrol came under fire from pro-Indonesian militia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> <b>and</b> then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1851, a {{squadron}} of Brazilian ships, consisting of four steamships, three corvettes and one brig {{under the command of}} Grenfell, forced a passage of the Paran√° River in the battle which became known as the Passage of the Tonelero. The Argentines had formed a powerful defensive line at The Tonelero Pass, near the cliffs of Acevedo, protected by 16 pieces of artillery and 2,000 riflemen under the command of general Lucio Norberto Mansilla. The Argentine troops exchanged fire with the Brazilian warships but were unable to prevent them from progressing upriver. The following day, the Brazilian ships returned and broke their way through The Tonelero's defenses, carrying the remaining troops of Marques de Sousa's Brazilian division upstream towards Gualeguaichu. This second influx of ships caused Mansilla and his soldiers to withdraw in chaos, abandoning their artillery, believing that the Allies were intending <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> attack their positions from the rear.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> bring in the heavy armor and the 1‚Äì63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E

Clearly, information was reaching the sepoys through {{a wide range of}} channels many originating as far as North America, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and India. Much of this information was obtained locally, but even so it was being mediated through a host of international and external actors, including a wide array of Indians from across the subcontinent, British officers and Arab and Malay coreligionists.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton.

The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of 'B' Company regrouped at Deniki, {{but they were}} in a bad state and when on 4 August, Major Allan Cameron, brigade major of the 30th Brigade, arrived to take command of Maroubra Force, most of them were sent back to Isurava in disgrace as he was under the mistaken belief that they had run away from the fighting. Nevertheless, on 8 August the rest of the 39th Battalion, now without the only troops who had any experience fighting the Japanese, launched a counterattack at Kokoda. They managed to secure one side of the airfield, but due to the close proximity of the Japanese on the other side, relief aircraft were unable <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> short of food and ammunition, they were forced to fall back to Deniki once again after almost two days of fighting. They eventually managed to halt the Japanese advance and on 14 August Maroubra Force fell back to Isurava.|$|E
5|$|Though {{convection}} later {{began to}} consolidate {{into a small}} central dense overcast (CDO) feature by March28, continued disruption of the low-level inflow prevented much development. M√©t√©o-France noted that despite forecasting the storm to peak as a moderate tropical storm, with winds of 75km/h (45mph), there was potential for rapid intensification due to the storm's small size. Conversely, the JTWC noted that proximity <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>and</b> dry mid-level air, represented by surface outflow boundaries, could hamper significant development. Once further over the Mozambique Channel, the system became increasingly organized and the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 21S. M√©t√©o-France followed suit at 0000UTC on March29 and classified the cyclone as a moderate tropical storm, with the tropical cyclone warning center in Madagascar assigning the name Hellen. Hellen soon assumed an east-southeast track toward Madagascar as a ridge established itself to the northeast. Throughout March29, the storm became increasingly organized with an eye apparent on microwave satellite imagery.|$|E
