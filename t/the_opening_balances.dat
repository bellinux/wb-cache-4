40|$|Both {{the legal}} and {{accounting}} conceptual differences in national legislations regulating mergers may be quite significant {{in spite of the}} unification processes taking place via the transposition of EU directives into national law. Most often, we find differences in the following issues: If there is a re-measurement or no re-measurement during mergers, and where re-measurement is required, the manner of its reflection in the accounting records in accordance with national regulations, usually as a modification of a general accounting method used for a purchase; The date of acquisition (balance sheet date) versus the date of coming into force by means of an entry in the prescribed register; The existence or non-existence of a duty to prepare special purpose financial reports whose consolidation is used to determine values in <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet of <b>the</b> legal successor of a merger of the businesses of the participating companies; The determination of an <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet by consolidating the special purpose financial reports or the participating companies, but 2 ̆ 013 technically 2 ̆ 013 by means of accounting entries by which the successor takes over the business of a liquidated company and its assets and liabilities, i. e. a de facto accounting procedure as used for booking the contribution of a business. From a formally legal point of view, these discrepancies represent obstacles in implementing crossborder mergers. If we do not take into consideration potentially inaccurate terminology arising from the translation of the EU directive regulating cross-border mergers, there is a solution based on the direction implied already in the 19802 ̆ 019 s by International Accounting Standards, i. e. to understand both domestic and cross-border mergers as business combinations and to build both commercial law and accounting law for this area on the common concept whose expression is a de facto general accounting method used for purchases...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. (International Accounting) The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} effect of applying a fair value model after the grant date to employee share options. The research assesses {{the appropriateness of}} the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment transactions with a specific focus on equity-settled Employee Share Options. The researcher has calculated the percentage movements or changes of fair value between each financial year including the overall percentage change. The study was mainly triggered by the IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment rules and various arguments from different authors challenging the appropriateness of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment on employee share options (ESOs) transactions in capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder at exercise date when applying a grant date accounting model. The study provides insights into whether a grant date accounting model is appropriate in measuring ESOs and capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder. The application of a static fair value model in measuring the value of ESOs has the potential for both positive and negative effects on the compensation cost recognised in the financial statements over the vesting period. After analysing the descriptive financial data on fair value per option over the six year period included in the sample selection, a conclusion was reached that, IASB should consider to true-up or make a restatement of <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> of <b>the</b> fair value reserves account in order to minimise the potential permanent error in equity accounts and to minimise the potential effect of understating or overstating the compensation cost. The IASB should further consider the proper classification of equity instruments issued to employee ESOs which comply with other financial instrument accounting standards such as the IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This will ensure that transactions viewed as economic equivalents of each other are treated in the same way from an accounting perspective, and the correct measurement basis of ESOs may be achieved...|$|R

40|$|It can be {{concluded}} from an analysis and {{comparison of the}} legal and accounting concepts related to the amendment of the Transformation of Business Companies and Cooperatives Act and Regulation 500, that the amended regulations are characterized by an extensive right to choose in terms of business regulation. While the legal and accounting regulations {{until the end of}} 2011 addressed transformations generally as purchasings, the commercial and accounting regulations from 1 st January 2012 provide solutions mainly for transformations of the restructuring type. The amendment offers a high degree of choice and thus provides space for both factual concepts, however, this fact is not specified in any of the appropriate regulations. The availability of all these possible variants, from the decisive date {{at the very beginning of}} the preparation and implementation of the transformation to the recognition of an entry of a transformation in the Register of Companies, as the record date, i. e., a combination of the decisive date and the effective date, leads to a complicated accounting view that is time-consuming, often confusing and, unfortunately, does not define the conditions for recognising a transformation with the substance of a purchase and a transformation with the substance of a restructuring. Highlighting the reflection based on individual accounting transactions for the participating companies, and especially in the unusual method included in <b>the</b> so-called <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet method, leads to a suppression of the information links between summary financial information from the financial statements on the entry into the transformation and the summarized financial information in the form of an <b>opening</b> <b>balance</b> sheet of <b>the</b> successor company...|$|R
