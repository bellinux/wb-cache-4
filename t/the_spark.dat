5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
50|$|The 1997 WNBA season, the league's first, {{opened with}} a game between <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> and <b>the</b> New York Liberty at <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> home (<b>The</b> Forum) in Inglewood. <b>The</b> <b>Sparks</b> lost <b>the</b> game 57-67. <b>Sparks</b> player Penny Toler scored the league's first two points with a lay-up 59 seconds into <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>Sparks</b> {{finished}} {{with a record of}} 14-14.

5|$|Roger's and his fellow-bishops' {{stories to}} Henry are {{often cited as}} <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> that touched off the king's anger at Becket and led to his martyrdom.

5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> for {{the emergence of a new}} Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the poll}} tax of 1381 was <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> of the Peasants' Revolt, {{the root of}} the {{conflict}} lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.|$|E

5|$|Anne was {{recalled}} {{to marry}} her Irish cousin, James Butler, {{a young man who}} was several years older than she and who was living at the English court, in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> to ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form of conservatism. Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best. The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (<b>The</b> <b>Spark),</b> a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E

25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> gap produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> gap is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so {{there are more than a}} hundred sparks per second.
