NATO members committed themselves to improve intelligence sharing through a Terrorist <b>Threat</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Unit. This Unit, created after the September 11 attacks, became permanent and [...] Its function is to analyze general terrorist threats, {{as well as those}} that are more specifically aimed at NATO. NATO also pledged itself to stand ready to assist any member country in dealing with potential or real terrorist attacks. The Alliance’s AWACS early warning radar aircraft and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Defence Battalion would be made available to any member that requests such assistance. Heads of State and Government also gave direction to develop a package of high-tech capabilities to protect civilians and forces from terrorist attacks.|$|E

2500|$|A UK {{government}} paper on security stated that Police Scotland would lose {{access to the}} intelligence apparatus of the UK, including MI5, SIS and GCHQ. The paper also said that an independent Scottish state would need to build its own security infrastructure. Theresa May commented that an independent Scotland would have access to less security capability, but would not necessarily face a reduced threat. In 2013, Allan Burnett, former head of intelligence with Strathclyde Police and Scotland's counter-terrorism co-ordinator until 2010, said that [...] "an independent Scotland would face less of a <b>threat,</b> <b>intelligence</b> institutions will be readily created, and allies will remain allies". Peter Jackson, professor of security at the University of Glasgow, agreed that Special Branch could form a [...] "suitable nucleus" [...] of a Scottish equivalent of MI5, and that Scotland could forego creating an equivalent of MI6, instead [...] "relying on pooled intelligence or diplomatic open sources" [...] like Canada or the Nordic countries. Baroness Ramsay, a Labour peer and former case officer with MI6, said that the Scottish government's standpoint on intelligence was [...] "extremely naïve" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "not going to be as simple as they think". Nicola Sturgeon stated that Scotland would create its own security service like MI5 to work alongside police and tackle terrorism, cyber attacks and serious organised crime. She also stated that creating an external intelligence agency would remain an option.|$|E

Given the diffuse nature of these new <b>threats,</b> <b>intelligence</b> analysts need to process very large amounts of data and strive to detect potentially threatening connections between different bits of diverse data. Drawing from biological investigations of the brain in neuroscience the authors lay out a multi-model information approach to store information and to automate an association mechanism.
