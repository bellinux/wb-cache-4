5|$|Canavan {{became the}} acting {{laboratory}} director at Boston Psychopathic after his death. In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries {{at the base of}} his brain were small, but the significance of this finding was unclear. The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{construction}} on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One {{integral part of the}} project was a storage dam on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their negative impacts and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that {{led to the creation of}} the Central Arizona Water Control Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any storage units on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> include dams for flood control.|$|E
5|$|The third project {{topic was}} disk mass potential. This topic was {{designed}} to make measurements of the distances to disk stars {{as well as their}} proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> determine the Solar System's position and velocity in the galaxy. The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews {{empirical}} research on cognitive {{factors associated with}} the experience of trauma and with the development of posttraumatic stress, Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. The review covers three main areas: cognitive experimental and neuropsychological studies; large scale studies on representative samples; and, randomized clinical trial data examining cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) interventions. Overall, the conclusions are that progress in all three areas lags far behind that in adult work and that, perhaps, <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> date raise more questions than they provide answers provided by <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> date. <b>The</b> paper concludes with detailed empirical recommendations for future research in the three chosen domains...|$|R

25|$|The attack gained {{controversy}} {{because it}} involved {{the bombing of}} civilians by a military air force. The number of victims is still disputed; the Basque government reported 1,654 people killed at the time, while local historians identified 126 victims (later revised by the authors of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> 153). A British source used by the Air War College claims 400 civilians died. Soviet archives claim 800 deaths on 1 May 1937, but this number may not include victims who later died of their injuries in hospitals or whose bodies were discovered buried in the rubble.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{burning of}} moorland {{vegetation}} in the UK {{has been shown}} to generate PAH which become incorporated into the peat surface. Burning of moorland vegetation such as heather initially generates high amounts of 2-3 ring PAH relative to 4-6 ringed PAH in surface sediments, however, this pattern is reversed as the lower molecular weight PAH are attenuated by biotic decay and photodegradation. Evaluation of the PAH distributions using statistical methods such as principal component analyses (PCA) enabled <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> link the source (burnt moorland)to pathway (suspended stream sediment) to the depositional sink (reservoir bed).|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{available}} health care resources, Nurse Rivers {{believed that the}} benefits of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> the men outweighed the risks. As the study became long term, Nurse Rivers became the chief person with continuity. Unlike the national, regional and on-site PHS administrators, doctors, and researchers, some of whom were political appointees with short tenure and others who changed jobs, Rivers continued at Tuskegee University. She was the only study staff person to work with participants for the full 40 years. By the 1950s, Nurse Rivers had become pivotal to the study: her personal knowledge of the subjects enabled maintenance of long-term follow up.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{original}} description and early {{work on this}} species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of L. schismatica flowers that were unisexual. The closely related species Triuris brevistylis was discovered to be mostly dioecious but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, just {{like that of the}} normal L. schismatica flowers. This discovery led the authors of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before L. schismatica and T. brevistylis diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight °C (10.8 to 14.4 °F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where L. schismatica is restricted to the warmer lowlands and T. brevistylis has a distribution in the cooler highlands.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2001, the National Automobile Dealers Association {{conducted}} a study revealing {{the average age of}} vehicles in operation in the US. The study found that of vehicles in operation in the US, 38.3% were older than ten years, 22.3% were between seven and ten years old, 25.8% were between three and six years old, and 13.5% were less than two years old. According to this study the majority of vehicles, 60.6%, of vehicles were older than seven years in 2001. This relatively high age of automobiles in the US might be explained by unaffordable prices for comparable new replacement vehicles and a corresponding gradual decline in sales figures since 1998. Also, many Americans own three or more vehicles. The low marginal cost of registering and insuring additional older vehicles, many of which are rarely used, could cause <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>to</b> be skewed as these vehicles are still given full weight in the statistics.|$|E
