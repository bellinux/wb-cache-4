50|$|Born in Au im Bregenzerwald in Vorarlberg, Beer was apprenticed to Michael Thumb.

He also had <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>at</b> Rheinau Abbey and the monastery of Saint Urban, both in Switzerland, built.

It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later Middle Ages (as seen at Cleeve Abbey) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.|$|E
5|$|At Christchurch, he {{reduced the}} number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13, through not {{replacing}} clerks who died.
