The main goal of <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan is {{to improve the quality of}} Lake Michigan and the life of its communities. This paper conducts an analysis of the total economic impact of all <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan-funded projects between 2011 and 2013. The methodology used is IMPLAN, an input-output method of analysis that estimates to what extent different spending categories affect the local economy in terms of direct, indirect, and induced spending. Both primary impacts (those impacts that are directly caused by <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan) and secondary impacts (those impacts that are indirectly caused by <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan) were considered. The primary finding of this study is that <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> <b>for</b> Lake Michigan has had a very positive, demonstrable economic impact in the southeastern region of Wisconsin including, but not limited to, creation of over 480 full-time equivalent jobs and increasing property values by over $ 45. 5 million.

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that <b>the</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
