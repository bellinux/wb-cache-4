30|$|The {{contribution}} {{presented in}} this work {{is the core of}} a larger workflow, of which we presented only a simplified model, leaving room for several possible improvements. For example, {{it is not possible to}} <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>off</b> optional element placeholders or convert between elements (placing a picture on a text placeholder if necessary, for example). Moreover, the template selection method searches for multiple combinations of picture placement on a page, which can be costly for the generation of picture-driven documents such as photo albums, and could be disallowed for a faster algorithm. Images could also have scaling constraints added to the scoring function from (3) (Sect.  5.2). For example, busy pictures would only be considered for placement in larger containers. This would result in a more efficient method with better results as well.|$|E
40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) {{undertook}} {{an innovative}} project in 1999 {{to develop a}} GIS-based inventory of fish-bearing streams, wetlands, threatened and endangered plant and animal habitat, and other sensitive resource sites within the transportation corridor of state-maintained highways. The objective of this effort was to create an environmental management tool for ODOT’s maintenance and operations activities and to facilitate an exemption under Section 4 (d) of the ESA. As a contractor to ODOT, Mason, Bruce & Girard, Inc. (MB&G) has completed this process for {{four of the five}} ODOT regions, totaling more than 7, 000 miles of state roadway. The project involves the unique integration of high-technology data capture methods, including: (1) high-resolution color infrared digital orthophotography, (2) imagery interpretation and on-screen digitizing of sensitive resource features, (3) road-side verification and capture of sensitive resources using laser rangefinders linked to vehicle-mounted real-time GPS units, and (4) sophisticated GIS modeling. With these tools we are able to accurately determine the locations and attributes of sensitive resources with an error rate of less than five percent. Key project deliverables include: (1) GIS coverages, or data layers, for twelve categories of sensitive resources present along all state roadways, (2) straight-line maps showing locations of sensitive resources for use by ODOT maintenance crews to facilitate resource protection, (3) high-resolution digital imagery of the state-wide transportation corridor (extending 500 feet each side of centerline), and (4) a desktop computer application that allows non-GIS users the ability to access and view these data. The comprehensive spatial database – comprised of the GIS and the digital imagery –allows biological resources to be considered early in the design process for roadway improvement projects, thus facilitating resource protection and environmental permitting. The desktop computer application, GeoBook™ allows environmental scientists, transportation planners, and engineers to query various segments of the state transportation corridor by highway name, number, or milepoint. Functionality includes the ability to pan and zoom in and out so that the user can move through the landscape and view the transportation corridor at any desired scale. The application also allows users to <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>off</b> the GIS coverages of the twelve categories of sensitive resources so that they can perform “virtual” environmental project scoping and preliminary alternatives analyses for transportation improvement projects...|$|E

40|$|CYSTIC {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a non- rectifying, low-conductance channel {{regulated by}} ATP and phosphorylation, which mediates apical chloride conductance in secretory epithelia and malfunctions in cystic fibrosis (CF). Mutations at Lys 335 and Arg 347 {{in the sixth}} predicted transmembrane helix of CFTR alter its halide selectivity in whole-cell studies and its single channel conductance, but the physical basis of these alterations is unknown and permeation in CFTR is poorly understood. Here we present evidence that wild-type CFTR can contain more than one anion simultaneously. The conductance of CFTR passes through a minimum when channels are bathed in mixtures of two permeant anions. This anomalous mole fraction effect can be abolished by replacing Arg 347 with an aspartate and can be <b>toggled</b> <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>off</b> by varying the pH after the same residue is replaced with a histidine. Thus the CFTR channel should provide a convenient model in which to study multi-ion pore behaviour and conduction.

However, the slow motion feature does not work with all games, including games compatible with the NES Zapper or R.O.B. accessories. The slow button works by very rapidly pressing a virtual start button, which could lead to problems when the player attempts to do an action while the game is paused (e.g., jumping or firing). This feature was not compatible with games with start menus or pause screens. The slow motion feature was unique at release, though it became a popular feature on later controllers.

Major overhaul of plotting functions for stochastic model plots. plot. netsim {{is now a}} separate method for epidemic plots (it was previously a function call to plot. icm), with function arguments and default settings more consistent across plotting functions. There may be minor backwards incompatibility for some epidemic plots. Network statistic plots in plot. netdx and plot. netsim now use the same methods and share the same defaults. The defaults for these plots will be to plot smoothed quantile bands (the IQR) and means of simulations without the individual simulation lines. Any individual elements may be <b>toggled</b> <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>off</b> as before. Modules are now listed in the output for param. icm and param. net classes. Removed dissolution argument to netest. This argument specified the right- hand sided dissolution formula for temporal ERGMs. It was removed because this formula was already specified in the dissolution_coefs function, the output of which is passed to netest, thereby removing the duplication. BUG FIXES as. data. frame methods for stochastic models remove NA from individual simulations when calculating row means. Fixed bug in network birth module for assigning infection status for incoming nodes. The verbose parameter in netest now correctly controls the model fitting output level in the underlying ergm and stergm functions. merge. netsim now correctly checks elements of two objects to be merged when the classes of those elements may be of length greater than 1.

40|$|The Facilities Planning, Design and Construction (FPDC) {{division}} of California State University, Northridge (CSUN) {{expressed a desire}} to convert building plans and infrastructure data to an electronic format for easy access and maintenance. The work described here relates to the design, development and implementation of a centralized web application to serve that purpose. The CSUN facilities web application is an internal website that contains campus information such as building floor plans, tree locations and information, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) zone data, and other facility attributes for use by FPDC and Physical Plant Management (PPM) (CSUN, 2013 a). The website was designed so FPDC and PPM could easily access and update their records on changes made to campus infrastructure, centralize their information into one system, and securely archive information for the productive management of campus facilities. In future the facilities website will be used to coordinate activities across campus units, in particular to incorporate CSUN class scheduling information so that schedulers can have access to plan drawings of buildings and rooms online; and to efficiently schedule classes to minimize resource use, such as heating and cooling. This project was funded by FPDC and CSUN's Institute for Sustainability and was developed by the author. Two web pages were created for the facilities website. One webpage is the website's home page that contains the campus map with building footprints over which building floor plans can be <b>toggled</b> <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>off.</b> The home page also contains the campus tree atlas, a measure tool, and imagery of the campus and surrounding area. The second webpage is almost identical; however, it allows the user to edit building and room information, and tree locations and data within the campus map. In its beta format the CSUN facilities website is being successfully used by FPDC. More applications and features are being added to the website to further utilize its potential and in future, parts of the website may be made accessible to faculty, staff and students. The website has the potential to decrease energy use on campus by coordinating building use with heating and cooling zones so empty rooms are not temperature controlled...|$|R
