5|$|The Flames {{continued}} to struggle after the Olympic break; they finished {{the season in}} tenth place in the West and missed <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time since 2003.

5|$|Burrows had a forgettable 2013–14 season, scoring only 5 {{goals and}} 10 assists. In 49 games played, {{he did not}} score until game 36, where he potted two goals against the Winnipeg Jets.

5|$|Following the merger, the Jets {{fell into}} mediocrity; Namath was dogged by {{injuries}} {{through much of}} his later career.

The Red Sox, struggling to get out of third place, failed to make <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in five years, but played spoiler during the final series of the season, knocking the Yankees out of first place in the American League East, relegating them to the wild-card for the 2010 season.|$|E

Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third time in his and his team's history.
