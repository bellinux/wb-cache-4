5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price <b>tag</b> <b>and</b> outdated single-speed drive. The last two games scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. TagMe! is a <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> {{exploration}} front-end for Flickr images, {{which enables}} users to annotate {{specific areas of}} an image, i. e. users can attach tag assignments to a specific area within an image and further categorize the tag assignments. Additionally, TagMe! automatically maps <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> categories to DBpedia URIs to clearly define the meaning. In this work we discuss the differences between <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> categories and show how both facets {{can be applied to}} learn semantic relations between concepts referenced by <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> categories. We also expose the benefits of the visual (spatial) context of the tag assignments, with respect to ranking algorithms for search and retrieval of relevant items. We do so by analyzing metrics of size and position of the annotated areas. Finally, in our experiments we compare different strategies to realize semantic mappings and show that already lightweight approaches map <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> categories with high precisions (86. 85 % and 93. 77 % respectively).

On October 7, 2012, Savio Vega reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, issuing yet another challenge. However, this time Colón fired back with a challenge of his own, inviting Vega to a special edition of Carlito's Cabana. The edition of Carlito's Cabana that featured Vega took place on October 14, 2012. In the segment, both traded insults and it finished with the security removing Vega when he tried to assault Colón after the former spat an apple in his face. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza he was disqualified, assaulting his opponent after his father, who served as special referee, did not allow Huertas González to use his finisher. At Honor vs. Traición, Colón unsuccessfully challenged Ray González for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. A Hair vs. Hair rematch was immediately scheduled for Lockout, which will feature a guest referee elected by popular vote between Vega and Huertas González. The following night marked the first time that Colón participated in a match where his father was among his opponents, but he avoided facing him directly, instead requesting a <b>tag</b> <b>and</b> only entering later to pin González.|$|E

The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog <b>tag,</b> <b>and</b> grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the <b>tag</b> <b>and</b> says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the correlation of annotated information unit (textual) <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> geographical identification metadata geotags. Despite the increased usage of geotagging in collaborative tagging systems, most current research focuses on textual tagging alone in solving the tag search problem. This may result in difficulties to search for precise and relevant information within the given tag space. For example, inconsistencies like polysemy, synonyms, and word inflections with plural forms complicate the tag search problem. Therefore, more work {{needs to be done to}} include geotag information with existing tagging information for analysis. In this paper, to make geotagging possible to be used in analysis with tagging, we prove that there is a strong correlation between <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> geotagging information. Our approach uses <b>tag</b> similarity <b>and</b> geographical distribution similarity to determine inter-relationships among <b>tags</b> <b>and</b> geotags.

Based on {{an extension of}} the incremental joint model for POS <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2011), we propose an efficient character-based decoding method that can combine features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS <b>tagging,</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing models. We also describe our method to align comparable states in the beam, and how we can combine features of different characteristics in our incremental framework. In experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB), we show that the accuracies of the three tasks can be improved significantly over the baseline models, particularly by 0. 6 % for POS <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> 2. 4 % for dependency parsing.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of joint part-of-speech (POS) <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> {{dependency}} parsing in Chinese. In Chinese, some POS tags are often hard to disambiguate without considering longrange syntactic information. Also, the traditional pipeline approach to POS <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing may suffer from the problem of error propagation. In this paper, we propose the first incremental approach to the task of joint POS <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing, which is built upon a shift-reduce parsing framework with dynamic programming. Although the incremental approach encounters difficulties with underspecified POS tags of look-ahead words, we overcome this issue by introducing so-called delayed features. Our joint approach achieved substantial improvements over the pipeline and baseline systems in both POS <b>tagging</b> <b>and</b> dependency parsing task, achieving the new state-of-the-art performance on this joint task. ...|$|R
