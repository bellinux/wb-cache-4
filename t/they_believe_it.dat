5|$|Some {{people have}} opposed {{feminism}} {{on the grounds}} that <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained. mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | page = 10 | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781581345704 | quote = The feminist assault on traditional gender roles and families began in earnest in the 1960s and increasingly turned radical in the 1970s. }} Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.|$|E

5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is probably less than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Max and the Goody {{sisters are}} soon {{involved}} in a streetfight with henchwoman Eiko (Ji Ling). After Max saves the sisters, and is {{involved in a}} further fight with Quicksilver (Johnny Trí Nguyễn), he is contacted by the leader of the criminals, Aya (Marie Matiko), who is also Eiko's lesbian lover. The Black Dragons explain that the jade dragon is actually an urn containing the ashes of their former leader, Yoshida, and that <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> holds mystical value and will stop at nothing to get it back. Max and the sisters agree to return the dragon at noon the following day in return for their own personal safety. They are helped by locals, including beach vendor Debbie (Carmen Electra) and Moko, with whom Max reconciled at the scene of Tahsi's killing. Nevertheless, Jane is torn between returning the figurine and protecting their lives, and ensuring that her sister finishes her M.D. The deal falls through as Jane's cell phone battery dies, and she does not arrive at the meet in time. Max escapes the angry henchmen on a jet ski.|$|E

25|$|Some cranks lack {{academic}} achievement, {{in which}} case they typically assert that academic training in the subject of their crank belief is not only unnecessary for discovering the truth, but actively harmful because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> poisons the minds by teaching falsehoods.

25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} is a philosophical consideration that {{observations of the}} Universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the {{anthropic principle}} reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 1918, {{the western}} {{coast of the}} island {{was hit by a}} major {{earthquake}} which caused a tsunami. The 1918 earthquake was caused by an old left-lateral strike-slip fault near the Mona Passage. In 1953, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was affected by the Santo Domingo earthquake. The actual subduction zone (Puerto Rico Trench) has not ruptured in over 200 years, which is a major concern to geophysicists, as <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> may be due for a major event.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} theism, God {{is characterized}} as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is {{devoid of any}} anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists {{do not believe that}} God can be completely defined. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.|$|E

25|$|Various theologians have {{assorted}} opinions {{as to why}} {{the apostles}} wrote the Codes in the first place, and then why they were directed to a variety of recipients in several New Testament passages. Some believe that the intent of the Codes is not universal throughout the passages in which they appear. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> necessary to determine the specific function of a Code within a specific New Testament passage. Timothy Gombis posits that {{the most important factor in}} determining the purpose of the Code is to consider the literary context in which it appears.|$|E
25|$|Commentators who {{characterize}} the Muslim reaction as hypocritical claim to several inconsistencies. First, the numerous anti-Semitic publications in Arab media. One website, Filibuster Cartoons, pointed out this criticism {{in a political}} cartoon. Also countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Libya where demonstrations are tightly controlled, {{have been accused of}} allowing violent riots as a distraction. In the case of Syria, protests would not be inconvenient in light of the current Hariri investigation. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is odd that cartoons are considered blasphemous when terrorist attacks in the name of Islam are not equally condemned by Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Scholar Andrew Whitehead {{states that}} Kashmiris view Kashmir {{as having been}} ruled by their own in 1586. Since then, <b>they</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>it</b> has been ruled in {{succession}} by the Mughals, Afghans, Sikhs, Dogras and, lately, the Indian government. Whitehead states that this is only partly true: the Mughals lavished much affection and resources on Kashmir, the Dogras made Srinagar their capital next only to their native Jammu city, and {{through much of the}} post-independence India, Kashmiri Muslims headed the state government. Yet Kashmiris bear an 'acute sense of grievance' that they were not in control of their own fate for centurues.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|Because Latter Day Saints {{believe that}} priesthood {{authority}} and keys may be granted only by one who holds that authority or keys, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> {{is important that}} a person trace their priesthood through a line of succession from {{a person in the}} Bible who was known to hold that authority or keys. Moreover, Latter Day Saints believe that the priesthood authority was absent from the earth during the Great Apostasy, and that priesthood had to be restored through Joseph Smith. Catholic and Orthodox Christians do not believe that such a complete apostasy ever took place when defending the validity of their priesthoods, and these churches do not recognize the priesthood exercised by Latter Day Saints.|$|E
25|$|The Calvinist atonement {{is called}} {{definite}} by some because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> certainly secures {{the salvation of}} those for whom Christ died, and it is called {{limited in its extent}} because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, {{which is to say that}} no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as particular redemption, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in general as General Baptists believe.|$|E
