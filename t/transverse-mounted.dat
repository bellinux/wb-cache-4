2500|$|Offerings for 1904 {{included}} a touring car {{model with a}} detachable rear tonneau and which seated 4 passengers. The <b>transverse-mounted,</b> vertical straight-four engine, producing 10hp (7.5kW), was mounted {{at the front of}} the car. A 2-speed planetary transmission was fitted. The car weighed [...] List price was US$1300. By contrast, the Ford Model F in 1905 was priced at $2,000, the FAL was US$1750, a Cole 30 or Colt Runabout was US$1500, the Ford Model S $700, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout US$650, Western's Gale Model A US$500, the Black could be as low as $375, and the Success hit the amazingly low US$250.|$|E
2500|$|While the Corvair sedan offered {{competent}} handling, [...] "the average buyer more {{accustomed to}} front-engined cars, did not take [...] account the car's different handling characteristics." [...] Chevrolet made a succession of improvements to the first-generation Corvair suspension. For the 1962 model year, the front anti–roll bar became available as an option. For the 1964 model year, the front anti-roll bar became standard equipment and the rear suspension was modified to include a camber compensating, <b>transverse-mounted</b> leaf spring extending between the rear wheels to limit rear wheel camber change, and carrying much of the rear weight combined with softer coil springs.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AMC bell housing bolt pattern, AMC/Jeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and four-cylinder bolt pattern (commonly used with GM's <b>transverse-mounted</b> powerplants) for their new engine, because the new AMC 2.5 replaced the four-cylinder engines that had been purchased from GM; and because AMC continued to buy the 2.8 L V6 from GM until the 4.0L I6 was introduced in 1987. The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-1984, the 3.8 liter LD5 {{engine was}} {{modified}} for <b>transverse-mounting</b> in smaller, FWD vehicles, and equipped with multi point fuel injection (MPFI). 1984-1985 models used a distributor and a distributorless wasted spark ignition system was added for all engines produced in 1986 and later. In 1986, it received sequential fuel injection (SFI) {{and it was}} initially produced in two forms, the LG2 with flat lifters (tappets), and the LG3 with a roller camshaft and lifters. The latter was offered in various models through 1988. From 1986, the 3.8 had a revised, crankshaft-driven oil pump which eliminated a longstanding problem with pump housing wear and loss of prime. Power produced by this engine was: ...|$|R
2500|$|The Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid, {{produced}} {{as early as}} 1899, was the first hybrid electric car. Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term [...] "plug-in hybrid" [...] has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket. The term [...] "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle" [...] was coined by UC Davis Professor Andrew Frank, who {{has been called the}} [...] "father of the modern plug-in hybrid." [...] The July 1969 issue of Popular Science featured an article on the General Motors XP-883 plug-in hybrid. The concept commuter vehicle housed six [...] lead–acid batteries in the trunk area and a <b>transverse-mounted</b> DC electric motor turning a front-wheel drive. [...] The car could be plugged into a standard North American 120 volt AC outlet for recharging.|$|E
2500|$|Work on {{designing}} the car began in late 2010 when early designs of its chassis {{were presented to}} Toyota Motorsport. The project was [...] halted briefly after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 although {{the building of the}} car was approved six months later. The carbon fibre monocoque was constructed at Toyota Motorsport's headquarters in Cologne which built 84% of the chassis, and performed aerodynamic development of the design in its wind tunnel. Designers were influenced by findings from outdated Dome chassis and impressions from current Audi and Peugeot monocoques. The suspension setup consisted of an independent double wishbone system with pushrod actuated dampers, and was designed to accommodate wide tyres. Its engine, a naturally aspirated petrol [...] V8 power unit, was mounted at a 90 degree angle, and produced [...] Toyota engineers elected to base the engine on their Super GT project instead of constructing a new power unit. The six-speed sequential gearbox unit was <b>transverse-mounted</b> to the engine and the brakes were constructed from carbon materials.|$|E
5000|$|The FJR1300 has a [...] <b>transverse-mounted</b> {{inline-four}} engine {{with four}} valves per cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The N94 had a <b>transverse-mounted</b> {{engine and}} a full low floor, and was a direct {{replacement}} of the N113.|$|E
5000|$|S series [...] - [...] S1000RR [...] - [...] sport {{bike with}} <b>transverse-mounted,</b> 999 cc {{inline-four}} engine. Models included S1000R, S1000XR ...|$|E
50|$|The Audi Q3 is {{a compact}} {{crossover}} made by Audi. The Q3 has a <b>transverse-mounted</b> front engine, and entered production in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Torsen {{differentials}} {{are used}} {{in many of the}} various Audi Quattro models, excluding the A3 and S3 and TT, which have <b>transverse-mounted</b> engines and use Haldex Traction 4WD systems.|$|E
50|$|Conceived as a small, {{economical}} and sporty car, the MR2 employed straightforward design elements, including {{fully independent}} MacPherson strut {{front and rear}} suspensions, four wheel disc brakes, and <b>transverse-mounted</b> inline-four engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} {{version was}} announced {{with the name}} Atlas for those manufactured in the USA and Teramont for those manufactured in China. Atlas will feature <b>transverse-mounted</b> engines of four-cylinders or Volkswagens narrow angle V6.|$|E
50|$|The Kawasaki Z500/Z550 series {{began with}} the 1979 Z500, a {{scaled-down}} version of the Kawasaki Z1R. It used a double-cradle steel frame with a <b>transverse-mounted</b> air-cooled 4-cylinder DOHC (Double Over Head Cam) engine—a classic Universal Japanese Motorcycle.|$|E
5000|$|The FZ750 uses an all-aluminium, liquid-cooled, <b>transverse-mounted,</b> four-{{cylinder}} engine. The complex {{cylinder head}} is constructed in two halves, with dual chain-driven overhead camshafts operating 20 valves, 3 inlet and 2 exhaust per cylinder. Valve clearances are adjusted with under-lifter shims.|$|E
50|$|As {{engineered}} by Dante Giacosa, the Fiat 128 featured a <b>transverse-mounted</b> engine with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism — an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested {{on a previous}} production model, the Primula, from its less market-critical subsidiary, Autobianchi.|$|E
50|$|The Volkswagen Atlas is a {{full-size}} {{sport utility vehicle}} (SUV) manufactured by German automaker Volkswagen at its Chattanooga plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee in the United States. The Atlas is the largest vehicle produced on the Volkswagen Group MQB platform and features a <b>transverse-mounted</b> inline-four or Volkswagen's narrow angle V6.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 16-valve {{inline-four}} with a displacement of [...] It has variable valve timing, {{derived from a}} Mitsubishi Motors car engine, which allows the phasing of the intake camshaft to be advanced by up to 24°. This continuous alteration happens progressively as the rpm rise and fall.|$|E
5000|$|The BMW K1200R is a naked {{supersport}} motorcycle manufactured between 2005 and 2008 by BMW Motorrad, {{producing a}} claimed [...] @ 10,250 rpm from its <b>transverse-mounted</b> 1,157 cc inline-four engine with torque of [...] @ 8,250 rpm. Acceleration to 60 mph from a standing start is {{claimed to be}} 2.6 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{double-ended}} <b>transverse-mounted</b> boiler {{was used}} to avoid problems of tilting when climbing hills. Internally it resembled a locomotive or Fairlie boiler with a central firebox and multiple fire-tubes to each end. In the Yorkshire though, a second bank of fire-tubes above returned to a central smokebox and a single chimney.|$|E
5000|$|The 206 GT used a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 2.0 L all-aluminium 65-degree V6 engine, with [...] at 8,000 rpm, {{the same}} {{used in the}} Fiat Dino.The 206 GT frame {{featured}} an aluminium body, full independent suspension, and all round disc brakes.152 were built in total during 1968 and 1969, in left hand drive only.|$|E
50|$|The GX3 used a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 1.6 L I4 engine {{from the}} VW Lupo GTI. This engine gave the GX3 an output of 125 PS (92 kW) and 152 N·m (112 ft·lbf) of torque. The GX3 could go from 0-100 km/h in 5.7 seconds {{and had a}} top speed of 200 km/h (125 mph). It used a {{six-speed}} manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|Its {{powerful}} <b>transverse-mounted,</b> inline four-cylinder, water-cooled {{engine was}} later {{used in the}} 1998 through 2002 model years of the Honda CB1300, although the X4 version had different carburetors and was geared to provide more low-end torque. The X4 is characterized by its low-slung profile, solid disc rear wheel, bulbous yet angular side panels, and stubby, large-diameter, chrome exhausts.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, an all-new, {{much smaller}} body {{attempted}} {{to combine the}} crisp angularity of the original Seville with the rounded edges of the new aerodynamic aesthetic. The series featured a <b>transverse-mounted</b> V8 driving the front wheels. The smaller size and conservative styling were regarded by some traditional Cadillac customers as rather bland and too similar to lesser cars produced by other GM divisions.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 Mercedes-Benz {{unveiled}} {{its first}} bus {{specifically designed for}} bus operation (and not derived from a lorry, {{as was the case}} of the other buses produced by the company until then) - the O6600 H. This 11-metre-long vehicle was equipped with a six-cylinder, <b>transverse-mounted</b> rear engine delivering 145 hp, a lower frame than its predecessors, and an electric gearshift system.|$|E
50|$|The 1,047 cc Honda CBX was {{produced}} from 1978 to 1982. The 1,300 cc Kawasaki KZ1300 {{was produced}} from 1979 to 1989. Benelli made the 750 cc and 900 cc the Sei from 1972 to 1978. Honda made a 250 cc straight-six GP bike. The BMW K1600GT and K1600GTL, which were launched in 2011, have a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 1,649 cc engine.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{driveline}} {{layout of}} the Eclipse is a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 4-cylinder Mitsubishi 4G37 or 4G63 engine situated on the left-hand {{side of the car}} driving an automatic or manual transmission on the right-hand side. AWD models have a different transmission which includes a limited-slip center differential and output shaft for a transfer case, which drives the rear differential (also available as limited-slip) and half-shafts.|$|E
50|$|Production of the VFR1200F {{began in}} October 2009 and first models were {{delivered}} in early 2010. The <b>transverse-mounted</b> V4 architecture is kept from previous VFR models though {{the engine and}} gearbox are completely new with displacement increased from 800 to 1200 cubic centimeters. A slightly de-tuned version of the engine, and the same gearbox, have been used on the VFR1200X Crosstourer, a dual-sport motorcycle launched in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|During a {{surprise}} {{appearance at the}} 2006 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Toyota drove and displayed a black 222D. The race-ready car weighed around 750 kg and its <b>transverse-mounted,</b> four-cylinder, turbocharged engine (what {{appears to be a}} 503E race engine, though other prototypes may have used the 4T-GTE) was reported to produce as much as [...] A V6-powered prototype was also rumored to exist, but has never been seen in public.|$|E
50|$|The Alfa Romeo Boxer {{engine was}} a {{water-cooled}} flat-4 piston engine developed by Alfa Romeo for front-wheel drive, longitudinal applications.It debuted on the Alfasud, which {{was introduced in}} 1971 at the Turin Motor Show. In the following decades the Boxer went through several upgrades and powered many Alfa Romeo front-wheel drive cars up to 1996 (not the 164). In 1997 it was phased out and replaced by the <b>transverse-mounted</b> Twin Spark engines.|$|E
5000|$|Four-cylinder {{engines are}} most {{commonly}} found in a <b>transverse-mounted</b> inline four layout, although some are longitudinal (as in the earlier BMW K100). V-4 and boxer designs (as in the earlier Honda Gold Wing) have been produced. One of the more unusual designs was the Ariel Square Four, effectively two parallel-twin engines one {{in front of the}} other in a common crankcase [...] - [...] it had remarkably little vibration due to the contra-rotating crankshafts.|$|E
50|$|An unadvertised at-cost option (#696) {{included}} upgraded {{springs and}} dampers, front anti-roll bars and rear-axle-rebound straps to prevent tuck-under. Aftermarket kits were also available, {{such as the}} EMPI Camber Compensator, for the knowledgeable owner. The suspension was modified for 1964 models, with inclusion of a standard front anti-roll bar and a <b>transverse-mounted</b> rear spring. In 1965, the totally redesigned four-link, fully independent rear suspension maintained a constant camber angle at the wheels. Corvairs from 1965 were not prone to the formerly characteristic tuck-under crashes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Alfa-Romeo had {{experimented with}} its first {{front-wheel-drive}} compact car named [...] "33" [...] (not related or referred to sports car similarly named [...] "33"). It {{had the same}} <b>transverse-mounted,</b> forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel-drive automobiles. It even resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the 33 never saw the production. Had Alfa-Romeo succeed in producing 33, it would precede the Mini as the first [...] "modern" [...] European front-wheel-drive compact car.|$|E
5000|$|The 206 GT used a <b>transverse-mounted</b> 2.0 litre all-aluminum, [...] at the 8,000 rpm redline, 65-degree V6 engine with dual {{overhead}} camshafts and a 9.7:1 compression ratio. Torque was 138 lbs/ft at 6,500 rpm. The crankshaft featured {{four main}} bearings. Induction was via three Weber 40 DCN/4 2-barrel carburetors. The 206 GT {{was the first}} car sold by Ferrari which used an electronic ignition, a Dinoplex C capacitive discharge ignition system that was developed by Magneti Marelli for the high revving Dino V6 engine (hence the name Dinoplex). It {{was also the first}} Ferrari product to have a direct rack-and-pinion steering.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most famous}} American {{passenger}} car application was the Chrysler system used {{beginning with the}} 1957 model year in cars such as the Imperial Crown series, although Chrysler's [...] "Torsion-Aire" [...] suspension was only for the front; the same basic system (longitudinal mounting) was maintained until the 1981 introduction of the K-car. A reengineered torsion bar suspension, introduced with the 1976 Dodge Aspen, introduced <b>transverse-mounted</b> torsion bars (possibly based on the Volkswagen Type 3 passenger car) until production ended in 1989 (with Chrysler's M platform). Some generations of the Dodge Dakota and Durango used torsion bars on the front suspension.|$|E
