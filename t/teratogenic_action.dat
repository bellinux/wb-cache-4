It is possible that by indirect offert (via mother) the appearance of developmental abnormalities asks for a longer time period.

40|$|Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), {{the most}} severe manifestation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is {{considered}} the leading non-hereditary cause of mental retardation and neurological deficit in the Western world. There lie a huge associated human cost to both FASD {{victims and their families}} and a considerable financial burden. This problem is being tackled on many fronts including community awareness programs, biomarker development for fetal alcohol exposure, research into preventative treatments and the development of more robust diagnostic systems for the early detection of FASD. Although ethanol can affect many of the major systems of the body, the eye is a primary target. Ocular aberrations including optic nerve hypoplasia, tortuosity of retinal vessels, coloboma and microphthalmia are frequently observed in children diagnosed with FAS. In this regard, ocular involvement in FAS has gained importance, particularly in relation to early diagnosis and identification of FAS. Furthermore, our considerable knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying eye development has provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of ethanol. In this review, we initially provide an overview of FASD in terms of historical background, epidemiology and current status.

40|$|Ethanol {{acts as a}} {{teratogen}} {{in developing}} fetuses causing abnormalities of the brain, heart, craniofacial bones, and limb skeletal elements. To assess whether some <b>teratogenic</b> <b>actions</b> of ethanol might occur via dysregulation of msx 2 expression, we examined msx 2 expression in developing mouse embryos exposed to ethanol on embryonic day (E) 8 of gestation and subjected to whole mount in situ hybridization on E 11 – 11. 5 using a riboprobe for mouse msx 2. Control mice exhibited expression of msx 2 in developing brain, the developing limb buds and apical ectodermal ridge, the lateral and nasal processes, olfactory pit, palatal shelf of the maxilla, the eye, {{the lens of the}} eye, otic vesicle, prevertebral bodies (notochord), and endocardial cushion. Embryos exposed to ethanol in utero were significantly smaller than their normal counterparts and did not exhibit expression of msx 2 in any structures. Similarly, msx 2 expression, as determined by reverse transcription–PCR and Northern blot hybridization, was reduced ≈ 40 – 50 % in fetal mouse calvarial osteoblastic cells exposed to 1 % ethanol for 48 hr while alkaline phosphatase was increased by 2 -fold and bone morphogenetic protein showed essentially no change. Transcriptional activity of the msx 2 promoter was specifically suppressed by alcohol in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblasts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that fetal alcohol exposure decreases msx 2 expression, a known regulator of osteoblast and myoblast differentiation, and suggest that one of the “putative” mechanisms for fetal alcohol syndrome is the inhibition of msx 2 expression during key developmental periods leading to developmental retardation, altered craniofacial morphogenesis, and cardiac defects...|$|R
40|$|It can be {{concluded}} that alcohol is definitely harmful to the developing fetus. The effect can manifest in various ways, the most extreme {{of which is a}} condition called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). The diagnosis of maternal alcoholism leading onto cases of FAS is difficult due to absence of accurate diagnostic tests. The diagnosis of FAS in a child is easier by a proper examination. There is no specific treatment of FAS in a child. The only management is by institution of corrective and rehabilitative measures. The exact mechanism of the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> of alcohol is not known. It is probably due to the harmful effect of alcohol on the epiblast layer of the bilaminar germ disc.

For this purpose various countries use classifications of medications broken down into risk categories during pregnancy. The most popular classification is US FDA classification, which identifies five categories of medications (А, В, С, D and Х) depending on the degree of their embryotoxic and teratogenic side effect, which enables physicians to make informed choices in selecting pharmacotherapy during the entire gestational period. The article discusses possible specific fetal and neonatal disorders when administering medications in categories X and D. Medications in category D may be prescribed to pregnant women only in extreme situations. Administering medications in category X is absolutely inadvisable before and during pregnancy.

The optimal teratogenic dose {{was determined to}} be 100 mg/kg and this dose was employed throughout the experiment. At autopsy at day 20 resorptions and malformations were found in all litters from treated females. Two periods of increased embryonic susceptibility to the lethal effects of ATDA were observed. The first at day 5 (100 % resorbed) and the second at days 9 and 10 (71. 5 and 92. 5 % resorbed).

The malformations were related to the developmental stage at the time of treatment. Supplemental treatment with nicotinamide at days 5, 11, 12, and 13 markedly diminished the teratogenic and lethal effects of ATDA, and at day 11 the administration of nicotinamide completely abolished its teratogenic activity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prenatal ethanol {{exposure}} {{can cause}} development retardation and malformations in human off-spring. Before {{the formation of}} chorioallantoic placenta, yolk sac {{plays an important role}} in transporting nutrients from the mother to the embryo. Functional suppression of yolk sac is found to be relevant to the malformations in mammalian embryos. METHODS: Female 8. 5 -day C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse embryos were cultured in vitro and exposed to different doses of ethanol. The development of visceral yolk sac (VYS) was examined with light and electron microscopes. The expression profiles of some vasculogenesis-related genes were detected with reverse transcrip-tion–PCR. RESULTS: A dose-dependent toxicity to the VYS was found, including reduced diameter, decreased protein and DNA contents, and suppressed development of vitelline vessels. The hypogenesis of VYS agreed with the retarded development and/or malformations found in the embryos. Histological and functional alterations were found in the ethanol-exposed VYS endodermal cells. The expressions of vasculogenesis-related genes, fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk 1) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (Tie 2), were repressed by ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired structural and functional development of VYS may contribute to the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> of ethanol in mice, which may also provide a clue to the study of fetal alcohol syndrome in humans.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the role that cellular retinoic acid binding protein I (CRABP-I) may play {{in the development of}} the murine hindbrain. Since the central nervous system (CNS) represents a major site of the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> of retinoic acid (RA), we have also determined the effects of exposure of high levels of RA on CRABP-I expression within the CNS. Expression of CRABP-I can first be detected within the presumptive hindbrain of presomitic mouse embryos and later also appears in neural crest cells and neural crest derivatives; it is thus tissue specific at these early stages. Exposure of 7. 75 -day mouse embryos to RA induces two phenotypes: one is externally normal and the other is exencephalic. In the exencephalic embryos we show that there is abnormal crest migration, a fusion of the trigeminal and facial-acoustic ganglia, a rostral and lateral shift of the otic vesicle, and a loss of hindbrain rhombomeres. Furthermore, and in contrast to in vitro studies, we demonstrate that CRABP-I appears to be up-regulated in both phenotypes of mouse embryos treated with RA and that this up-regulation is accompanied By an anteriorization of its expression within the nervous system. This new CRABP-I expression domain thus retains its tissue specificity. The role that CRABP-I may play in normal development of the hindbrain and in teratogenesis and the similarity of these results to those obtained with various Hox genes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{have been used}} world-wide in pregnant women for treatment {{of a variety of}} medical disorders, from bronchial asthma to systemic lupus erythematosous, to renal transplant. More recently their administration has been successfully addressed to the prevention of congenital fetal diseases. In some of these, such as for instance the 21 -hydroxylase deficiency leading to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the pathogenic mechanism is well known, while in others, such as the cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung, it is not yet understood. Besides these types of diseases, there are acquired inflammatory conditions impairing the physiologic evolution of pregnancy that benefit from glucocorticoid administration.

40|$|Certain short-chain {{carboxylic}} acids (SCCA) {{appear to}} share a common teratogenic potential, although the structural requirements for activity remain obscure. By using a whole rat embryo culture model system, several biochemical processes have been examined, either as potential initial sites of <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> or as early steps in the pathway to malformation. Valproate, methoxyacetate, and butyrate were the prototype SCCA examined. Measurement of [14 C]glucose utilization and lactate production confirmed that energy production by the early organogenesis embryo is predominantly from glycolysis. While the positive control agent, iodoacetate, caused a significant inhibition of lactate production, none of the SCCA affected this process or glucose utilization at teratogenic concentrations. Valproate did not influence embryonic acetyl CoA levels, {{in marked contrast to}} the reported response of adult liver, the other major target of valproate toxicity. Pinocytosis by the visceral yolk sac (VYS) was measured by the uptake of [125 I]polyvinylpyrrolidone. This process ultimately supplies the embryo with amino-acids and is essential for normal development. SCCA induce morphological abnormalities of the VYS in embryo culture. Pinocytosis was slightly reduced by valporate, but not the other SCCA. However, comparison with the action of an antiserum, for which inhibition of pinocytosis is the initial teratogenic insult, suggests {{that this is not the}} mechanism for valproate. Incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into embryo or yolk sac was not affected after 3 hr of SCCA exposure, but there was a marked effect of the positive control, hydroxyurea. This suggests that DNA synthesis is not directly influenced by SCCA. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{defects in}} limb buds of C 57 BL mouse embryos after the {{combined}} <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> of acetazolamide plus cadmium sulphate administered on day 9 of gestation were studied in serial sections. Postaxial deficiences observed in 12 - 15 -day embryos and affecting preferentially the right forelimbs were classified in nine morphological types according to {{increasing amounts of}} missing parts. Type X defect consists of a nearly complete amelia in which all four limbs are represented only by the girdle and proximal end of the stylopod. Type XI abnormality appears as an intermediate reduction affecting the area of digit IV. In addition to modifications of the forelimb bud shape detected from the 10 -day stage onwards, observations made 24 and 48 hr after treatment confirmed that the postaxial defects result from an absolute lack of postaxial mesoderm occurring without cell necrosis {{as a consequence of}} a postaxial shortening of the apical ectodermal ridge (aer). In 10 -day embryos, the latter appears shortened and hypertrophied; it is later fragmented into alternate thick and thin portions in 11 -day affected limb buds. These ectodermal changes might account for the genesis of all types of defects observed. Untreated 9 -day embryos with 12 - 25 pairs of somites display a number of asymmetries between their right and left forelimb territories: Until the 19 -somite stage, the vascular supply to that area is provided exclusively by the umbilical vein, which is larger on the right side; the initial amount of somatopleural limb mesoderm is greater in the right rudiment and the genesis of its aer is slightly protracted as compared to the left one. These asymmetries might contribute to the right side predominance of the forelimb defects induced by acetazolamide and cadmium. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

This misuse and the fact that, in many cases the desired pregnancy termination does not occur, raise concerns about fetal safety. Case reports of congenital anomalies after maternal use of misoprostol have been published. the objective of this work was to compare pregnancy outcome following misoprostol exposure with a matched control group, This is the first prospective controlled study on fetal safety after misoprostol use.

40|$|Congenital malformations now {{represent}} {{the largest single}} cause of mortality in the infant of the diabetic mother. The mechanism by which diabetes exerts its teratogenic effects is not known. This study evaluated whether arachidonic acid might be involved, a possibility raised by the role of arachidonic acid in palatal elevation and fusion, processes analogous to neural tube folding and fusion. This hypothesis was tested in two animal models of diabetic embryopathy, the in vivo pregnant diabetic rat and the in vitro hyperglycemic mouse embryo culture. The subcutaneous injection of arachidonic acid (200 - 400 mg/kg per day) into pregnant diabetic rats {{during the period of}} organ differentiation (days 6 - 12) did not alter the maternal glucose concentration, the maternal weight gain, or the weight of the embryos. However, the incidence of neural tube fusion defects was reduced from 11 % to 3. 8 % (P less than 0. 005), the frequency of cleft palate was reduced from 11 % to 4 % (P less than 0. 005), and the incidence of micrognathia was reduced from 7 % to 0. 8 % (P less than 0. 001). The addition of arachidonic acid to B 10. A mouse embryos in culture also resulted in a reversal of hyperglycemia-induced teratogenesis. The teratogenic effect of D-glucose (8 mg/ml) in the medium resulted in normal neural tube fusion in only 32 % of the embryos (P less than 0. 006 when compared to controls). Arachidonic acid supplementation (1 or 10 micrograms/ml) produced a rate of neural tube fusion (67 %) that was not significantly different from that observed in controls. The evidence presented indicates that arachidonic acid supplementation exerts a significant protective effect against the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action</b> of hyperglycemia in both in vivo (rat) and in vitro (mouse) animal models. These data therefore suggest that the mechanism mediating the teratogenic effect of an increased glucose concentration involves a functional deficiency of arachidonic acid at a critical stage of organogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Discovery of new parvoviruses led to taxonomical {{structure}} and the nomenclature of the Parvoviridae family reevaluation.  There are two subfamilies: Densovirinae and Parvovirinae. Densovirinae subfamily consists of viruses of arthropoda.  The Parvovirinae subfamily includes eight genuses of vertebrate animals viruses. In this review parvoviruses which are of interest to practical health care will be considered. Data on molecular and biological and virological characteristics of viruses, epidemiological and clinical features of the infections caused by these viruses are submitted. Parvoviruses which are interesting for human health care belong to five genuses: Bocaparvovirus, Dependoparvovirus, Erythroparvovirus, Protoparvovirus and Tetraparvovirus. The most known person pathogenic parvovirus is the Primate erythroparvovirus 1 virus which was earlier called by Human parvovirus B 19. It was discovered in 1975. It relates to the Erythroparvovirus genus. In this review the main {{attention is paid to}} less known viruses of this family. In viral lower respiratory tract infections structure the leading place is taken by Human Bocavirus — Primate bocaparvovirus 1 and Primate bocaparvovirus 2 relating to the Bocaparvovirus genus. In 2005, the virus of human, Primate tetraparvovirus 1, was discovered which belongs to the genus Tetraparvovirus. Clinically acute form of a tetraparvoviral infection is a top and lower respiratory tract and an alimentary tract disease. The virus possesses <b>teratogenic</b> <b>action.</b> Protoparvovirus genus representatives cause an alimentary tract disease also.  Two species, pathogenic for the person are described. Bufavirus (Primate protoparvovirus 1) was found in 2012. Tuzavirus (Primate protoparvovirus 2, Tusavirus 1) was highlighted in 2014.
