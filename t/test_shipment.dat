40|$|In the mid- 2000 s, the Ministry of Agriculture of Sudan {{started a}} project to promote rural {{development}} by exporting organic bananas to the Middle East and Europe. The project entailed a demand-driven coherent design of an export chain. For the European market, the potential to grow organic bananas is promising, as Sudan offers fertile soils with a climate exerting low disease pressure. A value-chain analysis offers insights into the competitive advantage, the nodes through which the product passes, and the key performance indicators for success at every node. Based on this approach, tests were conducted to identify cultivars with the best yields and agricultural and economic advantages for both market destinations. An export chain was developed, using technology used by small farmers in Latin America, using South-South knowledge exchange, to develop a logistic chain able to handle effective exports for both market destinations. With small and adapted investments and a carefully designed capacity building intervention, large improvements in {{the functioning of the}} chain could be achieved. The intervention showed also that a number of issues are complex and need further study, such as the availability of workers, their skills, and migrant and child labor. Shipments to the Middle East were analyzed and compared with the traditional approach. A <b>test</b> <b>shipment</b> of organic bananas for export to Europe was also carried out to test the packing and the logistics process and evaluate the quality and reception by customers upon arrival in Europe. The project failed to address value chain elements, such as logistics, marketing and economics, and the exacting requirements of quality systems, which made the interventions less effective. Analysis showed that involving industry partners, especially banana importers, was necessary to align elements in the value chain and overcome any rate-limiting steps thus rendering the value chain viablePeer Revie...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to compile and {{interpret}} drop heights and drop frequencies data for small parcel packages moving through the Eastman Kodak Company global distribution network. The need for this study arose from the inclusion of drop height probability curves into Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s shipping tests for packaged product weighing less than 100 lb. Kodak packaging engineers suspected the drop heights included in the probability curves were too high in drop height and too many in frequency when compared to the actual distribution environment. The data for this study resulted from dozens of <b>test</b> <b>shipments</b> using dummy-load packages throughout the Kodak global distribution network. The <b>test</b> <b>shipments</b> were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Australia. The test packages were equipped with a drop-height recording device called a SAVER to record when a drop occurred and from what height the package was dropped. Data from the recorder was downloaded, 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 events were sorted out from events that were not true drops. Once sorting was completed, the 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 data was analyzed utilizing various statistical techniques. The results of the analysis led to the development of data-derived statistical test plans based on the actual field-measured data. The results of this experiment, when compared to the probability curve currently in use, show that the drop heights outlined in the probability curve are too high and too many are called for. This experiment will serve as the basis for new shipping tests based on actual field measurements.

The emphasis on improvement in both efficiency and quality has {{become more and more}} significant in daily activities. The performance of Ericsson’s AXE/APZ products during <b>shipment</b> <b>test</b> phase is one such activity and is the focus of this thesis project. One of the essential principles of <b>shipment</b> <b>testing</b> is to ensure that the test campaigns finish on time. Over the last several decades companies have spent large amounts of time and money on improving test quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the results have not always been as good as expected. It seems that {{it is very difficult to}} improve <b>shipment</b> <b>testing</b> performance using traditional test management methods. Motorola introduced Six Sigma in 1986 and achieved 5. 4 Sigma level which help them saved 2. 2 Billion dollars during the first six years. From Statistic aspect, it means only 3. 4 defects per million opportunities. The Six Sigma methodology has been applied as a management philosophy focused on improving efficiency and performance during the <b>shipment</b> <b>test</b> period. This thesis gives an introduction to the Six Sigma approach, including the concepts of Six Sigma, its history, development, and methodology. More specifically the author uses the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) approach to evaluate the performance of Ericsson’s AXE/APZ <b>Shipment</b> <b>Testing.</b> This project goal was defined: Compare with the performance of 08 AXE <b>shipment</b> <b>test</b> which 87 % of test campaigns (2. 68 sigma level) were finished on time, 3 sigma level in 09 AXE <b>shipment</b> <b>test</b> which means 93 %of the test campaigns will be finished on time has to be achieved.   The thesis measured the 08 AXE <b>shipment</b> <b>test</b> performance and analyzed the lead time of test campaigns, found the root causes such as poor documents quality from the legacy project, lack of test resources, no system impact analysis. The thesis also provided a set of proposals for improvements and control of the improved process in order to ensure sustainable improved performance results. Finally 93 % test campaigns were finished on time in 09 AXE and project goal was fulfilled.

5000|$|The Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL, {{also known}} as the Swift Refrigerator Transportation Company) was a private {{refrigerator}} car line established around 1875 by Chicago meat packer Gustavus Swift, the founder of Swift and Company.Swift hoped to develop an alternative to transporting live cattle across the Midwest. He experimented by moving dressed (cut) meat using a string of ten boxcars which ran with their doors removed, and made a few <b>test</b> <b>shipments</b> to New York City during the winter months over the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical. In 1878, Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well-insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment {{at the top of the}} car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward. The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the center of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase's design proved to be a practical solution to providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats, and allowed Swift & Company to ship their products all over the United States, and even internationally, and in doing so radically altered the meat business. [...] Swift's attempts to sell this design to the major railroads were unanimously rebuffed as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in stock cars and animal pens if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then [...] - [...] when the American roads refused his business [...] - [...] he contracted with the Grand Trunk Railway (who derived little income from transporting animals [...] "on-the-hoof") to haul them into Michigan and then eastward through Canada.|$|R

From time to time they have heard such statements from customers as: are generally quite satis ® ed with your quality, and consider you one of our highest quality suppliers, but are bothered by some of the variations which occur. Every so often, we receive a series of poor shipments from you. These create a disruption of our production, and we are forced to ® nd a supplier whose quality is more dependable, even if their best is not as good as yours.

These materials hold the promise of achieving the program goal of developing LEU research reactor fuels with uranium densities in the 8 - 9 g/cm{sup 3 } range. Qualification of the U-Mo dispersion fuels has been delayed by a patent issue involving KAERI. Test fuel elements with uranium density of 6 g/cm{sup 3 } are being fabricated by BWXT and are expected to begin undergoing irradiation in the HFR-Petten reactor around March 2003, with a goal of qualifying this fuel by mid- 2005. U-Mo fuel with uranium density of 8 - 9 g/cm{sup 3 } is expected to be qualified by mid- 2007. Final irradiation tests of LEU {sup 99 }Mo targets in the RAS-GAS reactor at BATAN, in Indonesia, had to be postponed because of the 9 / 11 attacks, but the results collected to date indicate that these targets will soon be ready for commercial production. Excellent cooperation is also in progress with the CNEA in Argentina, MDSN/AECL in Canada, and ANSTO in Australia. Irradiation testing of five WWR-M 2 tube-type fuel assemblies fabricated by the NZChK and containing LEU UO{sub 2 } dispersion fuel was successfully completed within the Russian RERTR program. A new LEU U-Mo pin-type fuel {{that could be used to}} convert most Russian-designed research reactors has been developed by VNIINM and is ready for <b>testing.</b> Four additional <b>shipments</b> containing 822 spent fuel assemblies from foreign research reactors were accepted by the U. S. by September 30, 2001. Altogether, 4, 562 spent fuel assemblies from foreign research reactors had been received by that date by the U. S. under the FRR SNF acceptance policy. The RERTR program is aggressively pursuing qualification of high-density LEU U-Mo dispersion fuels, with the dual goal of enabling further conversions and of developing a substitute for LEU silicide fuels that can be more easily disposed of after expiration of the U. S. FRR SNF Acceptance Program. As in the past, the success of the RERTR program will depend on the international friendship and cooperation that has always been its trademark...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introductory part and five self-contained papers dealing with market definitions and economic assessments of horizontal mergers in the minerals industries world-wide. Paper I analyses the relevant geographic market for internationally traded steam and coking coal using Cointegration and Error Correction models. Quarterly price series data between 1980 and 2000, in the two dominating regions Europe and Japan, are used. The results show that for both markets the null hypothesis {{of the existence of}} a world market cannot be rejected, as demonstrated by the long- run cointegrating relationship between the price series. However, the short- run adjustments to the long-run levels indicate a faster adjustment towards the long-run equilibrium for coking coal than for steam coal. In Paper II the relevant economic markets for steam and coking coal are also in focus, and this paper applies two different <b>tests</b> using <b>shipments</b> data and price data, respectively. The results from both methods point in the same direction. In the case of coking coal the results indicate that the market is essentially global in scope, and also that the market has become more integrated over time. The results for steam coal show that the market is more regional in scope, and there exist no clear tendencies of increased integration over time. One policy implication of the finding that the steam coal market is more regional in scope, is that a merger in this market would likely be of more concern for antitrust authorities than the same activity in the coking coal market. Paper III estimates the price and welfare effects from the iron ore mergers between Rio Tinto and North Ltd in 2000, and CVRD and Caemi in 2001. The analyses are conducted using a merger simulation model that, based on the pre-merger situation, estimates the post-merger outcome. A standard Cournot framework model assuming homogenous product and that firms set quantities have been applied. The results from the merger simulations show that the estimated prices increases due to the mergers are about 6 % and 7 %, respectively. In both merger simulations the overall welfare effect is estimated to be negative, something which thus does not support the European Commission's decisions to allow these mergers. However, none of the simulations did take into account possible cost efficiencies resulting from the mergers. Paper IV also applies merger simulations to the same mergers as in Paper III. However, the merger model in this paper (PCAIDS) assumes that the product is differentiated and that the firms' strategic variable is price. The increases in the estimated market-weighted average price are 2. 6 % and 4. 6 %, respectively. When removing Caemi's Canadian asset, which is the Commission's verdict for allowing the merger, the estimated market price following the CVRD-Caemi merger decreases to about 3 %. Overall the results support the Commission's decisions regarding both merger cases, and show that merger simulations of price effects can be a valuable tool in merger assessments. Finally, Paper V applies an event study to the Rio Tinto and North Ltd merger in order to analyse the competitive and efficiency impacts of the merger, and to investigate the main motivation behind the merger. The event study method analyses stock market reactions of the merging firms and close rivals {{at the time of the}} merger announcement. These reactions indicate whether the merger has had a positive or negative impact on the value of the firms, information that in turn can be used to assess the overall efficiency and welfare effects of the merger. The main result shows that efficiency improvements were the predominant motive behind the merger. This suggests that there are positive welfare effects to expect and the Commission's decision to allow the merger is supported. An overall conclusion from this thesis is that all the quantitative economic techniques that have been applied can provide information that is valuable in a comprehensive merger assessment study, but all methods need to be complemented by supplementary (often qualitative) analyses.
