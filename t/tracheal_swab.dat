40|$|Objective: To {{standardize}} an ELISA {{protocol to}} quantify total immunoglobulin A (IgA) from different biological samples. Methods: Two independent experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, total IgA levels were quantified from the lachrymal fluid, <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab,</b> and cloacal swab at various time points from Days 30 to 89 in white Leghorn chickens. Experiment 2 {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of 50 or 500  ppb of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) on total IgA quantified in samples from the lachrymal fluid, <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab,</b> gut content and cloacal swab in broiler chickens at 21 days of age. Results: Lachrymal fluid contained {{the highest level of}} IgA; however, the sampling procedure was time consuming and stressful to the bird, and the sample volume depends largely {{on the size of the}} chicken. Cloacal swabs also contained a high concentration of IgA; this sampling procedure was faster than lachrymal fluid sampling and was not affected by the age of the bird. Tracheal sampling was more difficult than cloacal sampling; the age of the bird limited the sampling, and the IgA concentration was the lowest detected at all sampling ages. 500  ppb of AFB 1 significantly reduced total IgA concentration in the gut content compared with control or 50  ppb of AFB 1 treated groups. Interestingly, a significant reduction in total IgA was also observed in those chickens that received 50  ppb of AFB 1 in gut rinse when compared with cloacal swabs.

40|$|Mycoplasma synoviae has during {{many years}} been {{considered}} a less important pathogenic species for poultry than Mycoplasma gallisepticum, causing subclinical respiratory infections in broilers. However, {{the importance of this}} bacterium and its relevance from a clinical and economic viewpoint has increased since M. synoviae arthritis, amyloid arthropathy, and eggshell apex abnormalities have been reported. Because of vertical transmission of mycoplasma species, there is an official eradication program for M. gallisepticum in breeder stock. Since the implementation of such a program, a decreasing incidence of M. gallisepticum has been observed. However, for M. synoviae, there is currently no such eradication program which may be a cause of dissemination from breeder stock into layer and broiler holdings. During a prevalence study on M. gallisepticum in Belgium, data on presence of M. synoviae in broiler holdings, backyard flocks and wild birds was also gathered. A random selection of poultry herds, proportional to herd density per province, was made based on the active holdings present in the Belgian National Animal Identification and Registration System (Sanitel) data base owned by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC). At each broiler holding (n= 102) 12 <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected and analysed using a commercial real-time PCR kit (ADIAVET™ Myco AV, Biomérieux). Fifty-six owners of backyard chickens (n= 460) were visited and of each owner maximum 10 chickens were sampled. <b>Tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> from wild birds (n= 100) were collected by hunters during hunting season of September – January 2013; and three bird rescue centers were visited and <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> (n= 90) were taken from different species of wild birds common in Belgium. All <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> were analyzed with RT-PCR (ADIAVET™ Myco AV, Biomérieux). Twenty-seven broiler holdings (26. 5 %; 95 % CI: 18. 9 - 35. 8 %) tested positive for M. synoviae with a within herd prevalence of 48. 8 % (95 % CI: 43. 4 - 54. 2 %) and 158 out of 1224 <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> (12. 9 %; 95 % CI: 11. 1 - 14. 9 %) were M. synoviae positive. Fifty-four out of 56 owners of backyard chickens had positive flocks resulting in a seroprevalence of 96. 4 % (95 % CI: 87. 9 - 99 %) of backyard flocks with a within flock prevalence of 78 % (73. 9 - 81. 6 %). Three hundred and fifty-one out of 460 <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> (76. 3 %; 95 % CI: 72. 2 - 80 %) were positive for M. synoviae. Four samples (one crow and three wood pigeons) obtained during hunting season (4 %; 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 9. 8 %) tested positive for M. synoviae. Three samples (one peacock pigeon and two wood pigeons) out of 90 <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> collected in bird rescue centers (3. 3 %; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 9. 3 %) were M. synoviae positive. The prevalence of M. synoviae in broilers is high which could be related to the lack of eradication programs and the possibility of vertical transmission from breeder stock into commercial poultry holdings. In backyard chickens the seroprevalence of M. synoviae is extremely high which indicates that they may act as reservoir for this bacterium from which dissemination to poultry holdings is possible.

The {{aim of this study}} is to isolate and characterize the causal agent of the disease. Samples of serum, feather follicle, <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab,</b> as well as organs of proventriculus, intestine, caecal tonsil, trachea and lungs were collected from infected animals. Serum samples were tested haemaglutination/haemaglutination inhibition to Newcastle Disease and Egg Drop Syndrome viruses. Isolation of virus of the causal agent of the outbreak was conducted from samples of feather follicle, <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab,</b> and organs using 11 days old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs. The isolated viruses were then characterised by agar gel precipitation test using swine influenza reference antisera, by haemaglutination inhibition using H 1 to H 15 reference antisera, and by electron microscope examination. The pathogenicity of the viruses was confirmed by intravenous pathogenicity index test and its culture in Chicken Embryo Fibroblast primary cell culture without addition of trypsin. The study revealed that the causative agent of the outbreaks of avian disease in Indonesia was avian influenza H 5 subtype virus based upon serological tests, virus isolation and characterization using swine influenza reference antisera, and electron microscope examination. While subtyping of the viruses using H 1 to H 15 reference antisera suggested that the virus is very likely to be an avian influenza H 5 N 1 subtype virus. The pathogenicity test confirmed that the viruses are highly pathogenic to experimental animals. It is concluded that the causative agent of the outbreaks of avian disease in Indonesia was avian influenza H 5 subtype virus.

The swabs were processed in pool and tested using 2 real time RT-PCR specific for the two vaccines and a generic RT-PCR for IBV followed by sequencing. Titration of antibodies against Mass, QX, Q 1 and 793 B strains was perfomed in each sample using hemoagglutination inibition test. The real time RT-PCR for IBV QX vaccine was positive in <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> at days 12, 22 and 42 and only in cloacal ones at day 12. RT-PCR and sequencing were positive for IBV QX field strain in <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> at days 32 and 42 and in cloacal ones at days 32, 42 and 52, while <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> were positive for a QX- 793 B recombinant strain at day 52. No clinical signs were observed during the whole production cycle confirming the efficacy of QX vaccine in controlling the disease caused by homologous variant. Furthermore the detection of a recombinant strain in healthy animal supports the hypothesis that the combination of vaccines applied in this farm could also protect against an enlarged spectrum of variants as already proved for the association between vaccines belonging to Mass and 793 B genotype. Experimental challenges will be necessary to confirm field findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{zoonotic}} {{potential of}} the circulating influenza subtypes in avian species underscore the importance of surveillance of influenza virus in the avian population. So far {{there is only one}} published study in the Caribbean region on the presence of Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) in Barbados. A screening approach based on blood and cloacal and <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> to study the prevalence of influenza A in the avian population of Grenada was carried out in 2009 - 2010. We collected 230 blood samples and 230 mixed <b>tracheal</b> and cloacal <b>swabs</b> from backyard chicken (143), ducks (45), turkey (10), guinea fowl (1) and pigeon (31). Samples were screened by RT-PCR, embryo inoculation and ELISA for AIV. Neither AIV RNA was found by RTPCR nor could virus be isolated in embryonated eggs. 27 blood samples from backyard chickens were positive for AIV antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is a {{respiratory}} pathogen {{which has}} been isolated throughout the world from numerous bird species. The present {{study was designed to}} isolate and characterize the ORT from domestic turkeys, quails and pigeons. For this purpose, 250 samples from each bird species (turkey, quail and pigeon) with or without respiratory signs were tested by taking of <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs.</b> In addition, respiratory tissue samples (tracheal and lung), from 250 slaughtered turkeys, 50 slaughtered quails and 100 dead pigeons were also subjected to culture for ORT as <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs.</b> Respiratory tissues were also tested for bacterial DNA by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In general, 30 isolates including 4 isolates from turkeys, 3 isolates from quails and 23 isolates from pigeons were identified as ORT by bacteriologicalmethod and then confirmed by PCR. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 %, 50 % and 35 % of respiratory tissues in turkeys, quails and pigeons respectively. Five ORT isolates from pigeon and all four isolates from turkey showed smaller colony size, while other isolates had larger colonies when cultured in blood agar. Fifty percent of the isolates with larger colony but none of the isolates with small colony size could agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs). All of the isolates were sensitive to danofloxacin and chloramphenicolwhile more than 90 % of pigeon isolates were resistant to ampicillin. All of turkey and quail and 30 % of pigeon isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Our ORT isolates showed high identity (98 %- 100 %) insequence of 16 S rRNA gene to related data in GeneBank...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{influenza}} A (H 7 N 9) {{virus has}} emerged in China. To rapidly detect this virus from clinical samples, we developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method {{for the detection of}} the H 7 N 9 virus. The minimum detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 0. 01 [*]PFU H 7 N 9 virus, making this method 100 -fold more sensitive to the detection of the H 7 N 9 virus than conventional RT-PCR. The H 7 N 9 virus RT-LAMP assays can efficiently detect different sources of H 7 N 9 influenza virus RNA (from chickens, pigeons, the environment, and humans). No cross-reactive amplification with the RNA of other subtype influenza viruses or of other avian respiratory viruses was observed. The assays can effectively detect H 7 N 9 influenza virus RNA in drinking water, soil, cloacal swab, and <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab</b> samples that were collected from live poultry markets, as well as human H 7 N 9 virus, in less than 30 [*]min. These results suggest that the H 7 N 9 virus RT-LAMP assays were efficient, practical, and rapid diagnostic methods for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of influenza A (H 7 N 9) virus from different resource samples...|$|E
40|$|Objective: An {{attempt was}} {{undertaken}} {{for the detection}} and characterization of Avibacterium paragallinarum from clinically sick broiler chickens during field outbreaks. Materials and methods: Nasal and ocular discharges (n= 6), <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab</b> (n= 6), tracheal washing (n= 4) and infraorbital sinus exudates (n= 4) were collected aseptically from broiler chickens (n= 10). To isolate A. paragallinarum, the clinical samples were cultured onto blood agar and chocolate agar enriched with Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) and feeder organism (Staphylococcus aureus). Identification of A. paragallinarum was performed by Gram staining reaction, sugar fermentation profiles using five basic sugars (Dextrose, Maltose, Sucrose, Lactose and Mannitol) and biochemical tests (Indole, Voges Proskauer and Methyl red tests). Antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of infected chicken was performed against five antibiotics namely Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin, Gentamicin, Ampicillin and Cefalexin using disk diffusion method. Results: Results of colonial morphology, Gram staining reaction, sugar fermentation and biochemical tests confirmed one isolate as A. paragallinarum. The overall prevalence of IC in broiler chicken was 10 % (1 of 10). This isolate {{was found to be}} sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Azithroycin and Gentamicin and resistant to Ampicillin and Cefalexin. Conclusion: This is the first report of detection of A. paragallinarum from broiler chicken in Bangladesh. [J Adv Vet Anim Res 2016; 3 (2. 000) : 173 - 177...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{mycoplasmosis}} is {{a disease}} that considerably affects the poultry sector, which {{is reflected in the}} decrease of the production parameters in fertile and commercial egg laying broilers. Presentation costs are so high that it is impossible for the poultry industry to survive without thinking of its effective control or eradication. There is great interest in the type of M. gallisepticum (Mg) strains, both vaccine and field, which are key aspects to handle the disease, but there is still no definitive method for Mg strain characterization. Genes related to surface proteins —gapA and mgc 2,lipoprotein (lp) — that make it possible to identify and characterize the Mg genomically are currently being studied. In this study, regions of the lp gene were amplified from strains F and Ts- 11 of Mg through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, which gave an amplicon of 455 bp for each of the strains; each of the amplicons was applied the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) test with the Taq I enzyme, which made it possible to differentiate vaccine strains from field strains obtained from <b>tracheal</b> <b>swab</b> samples taken at commercial farms. It was demonstrated that PCRRFLP is an appropriate method of diagnosis of mycoplasmosis in our environment...|$|E
40|$|Cross-sectional {{survey for}} Newcastle disease (ND) were {{conducted}} in nonvaccinated household flocks of village chickens to assess serological and virological ND status in households and associated live bird markets. In total, 1, 899 sera and 460 pools of cloacal and <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> were sampled and tested using a commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respectively. Additionally, paired cloacal and <b>tracheal</b> <b>swabs</b> from 1, 269 individual chickens were collected from markets and tested using RT-PCR. The prevalence of households {{with at least one}} seropositive chicken was higher during the dry season (27. 4 %) than during the wet season (17. 4 %) (P 00. 003). Viral genome was detected in 14. 2 % of households during the wet season using a fusion (F) gene assay and in 24. 2 % of households during the dry season using a polymerase (L) gene assay that targets both class I and class II viruses. At the markets sampled, overall bird level prevalence was 4. 9 % for period 1 (F gene assay), and 38. 2 % and 27. 6 % for periods 2 and 3, respectively (L gene assay). Partial sequencing of the F gene (239 bp) cleavage site indicated {{that the majority of the}} circulating strains exhibited motifs specific to virulent strains. Seroepidemiology coupled with molecular analysis can be a useful tool to assess the status of NDV infection. The village chicken population in Ethiopia is endemically infected with virulent NDV that pose a significant threat to emerging smalland medium-scale commercial poultry production.
