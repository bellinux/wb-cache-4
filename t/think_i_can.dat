5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very kind," [...] {{said the}} young man, {{and for the}} third or fourth time he wrung her hand. [...] "It isn't a partnership, of course; but he <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be of use to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly;--but {{that is a}} sort {{of reason}} which a man will do his best to conquer. Do not {{misunderstand}} me. I am not such a fool as to <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prevail in a day. I am not vain enough to <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> prevail at all. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> persist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; Dalton <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{qualify for}} the {{position}} of Supervisor, and Redfield may offer me the supervision of this forest. If he does, I will accept it--if you will go with me and share the small home which the Supervisor's pay provides. Will you go?" ...|$|R
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted him}} [...] to do it. And he said 'yeah'. I said 'are {{you sure you}} can? Because you've got so much to do.' He said 'I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this.' I kinda got afraid because I knew he was working so hard." ...|$|E
60|$|FROME. [Rising] If your lordship {{would allow}} me to address you in {{mitigation}} of sentence. I don't know if your lordship <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> add anything to what I have said to the jury on the score of the prisoner's youth, and the great stress under which he acted.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{truth is}} simple," [...] he said earnestly. [...] "We do not know. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> answer for myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> answer for the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob {{will think}} you made these plum sweetmeats, Beulah," [...] said Maud, with a saucy smile, as she placed a glass {{plate on the}} table--"He never <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make {{anything}} of this sort; and, as he is so fond of plums, he will be certain to taste them; then you will come in for the praise!" ...|$|R
500|$|Dawson has said, {{regarding}} {{playing the}} role of Darren, [...] "I love playing the bad lad. He's my alter ego". In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was [...] "turning a bit into Ken Barlow" [...] and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was [...] "still learning" [...] and did not take his role for granted. He stated, [...] "I’m not ignorant enough to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just go off and be a Hollywood star! I’d like to take on some more challenges for Darren".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If you still feel doubtful about the little cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
500|$|Baird and Jackie later {{met their}} half-sister, Victoria/Ingrid, {{when they were}} present at the {{ceremony}} to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi's house to commemorate the fact that Lennon had lived there. Stanley Parkes (Lennon's cousin) was on the ladder fixing the plaque {{to the wall and}} said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see Ingrid" [...] Baird and her sister were surprised, as it meant that Parkes had seen Ingrid before, even though Baird and Jackie never had. When all three finally {{met for the first time}} Baird was shocked that Ingrid did not look anything like the Stanley family, as she had [...] "pale blue eyes and fair hair".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} a peep through that, Watson. If you bend your back and support {{yourself}} upon the wall, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> manage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tannehill had {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} become the starting quarterback at A&M: [...] "I still {{think of myself as}} a quarterback, I still want to be a quarterback here at A&M. Hopefully that's the way it turns out. But if things don't happen that way, and Coach <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> better help being a receiver, then I guess I'm okay with that." ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Beach Games", Michael {{announces that}} {{the winner of}} his Survivor-style game will get his job. In an interview, Oscar states that if Dwight gets the position, he will {{transfer}} to Albany. He also mentions that {{he is trying to}} get out of his relationship with Gil and that he [...] "might try women for a while; Angela <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> cross over." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the Rose Bowl, Sanchez stated it would be [...] "hard to say goodbye to [...] I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it." [...] However, with the subsequent announcement that other NFL-caliber quarterbacks, such as Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, and Colt McCoy had decided to stay in school, rumors arose that Sanchez would use the opportunity to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. On January 15, Sanchez announced his plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL Draft, although he continued as a USC student and completed work on his degree in the spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft.|$|E
500|$|Reger {{completed}} the composition on 25August 1915. He {{wrote to the}} publisher [...] on : [...] "I've finished two choral works (Der Einsiedler and Requiem). I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely say that they're both among the most beautiful things I've ever written." [...] (Ich habe nun zwei Chorwerke (Der Einsiedler und Requiem) fertig. Ich glaube sagen zu dürfen, daß diese beiden Chorwerke mit das Schönste sind, was ich je geschrieben habe.) Requiem was first published by [...] in 1916, edited by Ulrich Haverkampf, with the dedication Dem Andenken der im Kriege gefallenen deutschen Helden (To {{the memory of the}} German heroes who fell in the War). Simrock also published a vocal score as prepared by Reger himself.|$|E
500|$|Energized by {{the success}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter {{considered}} expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks. She wrote her editor Norman Warne, [...] "I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher... I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make something of him". The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's [...] illustrations for Jeremy: [...] "When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist".|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, {{your father}} has {{nothing to fear from}} me," [...] he assured her tenderly. [...] "On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> show him the way to safety." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take {{no better}} text {{for the subject}} on which I am about to preach, than that which the Gospel for this day gives me.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, between ourselves, {{he married}} a diplomatist too. If he can manage the British Empire, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> manage him, Ida. How {{long have you been}} engaged, child?" ...|$|R
500|$|In 1978, Washington {{teenager}} MacKaye discovered {{punk rock}} through a local college radio station, Georgetown University's WGTB. He met Nelson, a classmate of his, after the latter {{set off a}} pipe bomb outside their school and MacKaye went to investigate. The two became friends and quickly discovered their shared interest in punk. MacKaye and Nelson saw their first punk show in January 1979—a benefit concert by the Cramps for WGTB. The concert inspired the pair; MacKaye later admitted, [...] "It blew my mind because I saw {{for the first time}} this huge, totally invisible community that had gathered together for this tribal event. [...] I thought, 'This appeals to me. This is the world I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> breathe in. This is what I need'".|$|E
500|$|After {{the speech}} Kennedy took a {{chartered}} plane to Washington D.C. As it approached the city, the passengers could see smoke rising from fires started during the riots. Kennedy asked the pilot to circle again {{to get another}} view. Upon landing, Kennedy proposed driving into the riot zone to calm down the mobs, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do something with these people." [...] Most of his aides were shocked at the idea. Fred Dutton, attempting to delay, suggested that Kennedy inform Mayor Walter Washington of his plans as a courtesy. John Bartlow Martin told him that little could be done while people were still rioting, {{and that he would}} appear to be grandstanding. Kennedy then reluctantly went home.|$|E
500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals {{convinced}} me it wasn't something I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see," [...] he said. [...] "If Mannering {{is not for}} us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{at least}} promise that he does no harm on the other side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems that}} this is a {{dangerous}} affair," [...] she replied uneasily, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> guess your aim. Now if I help you, Kaku, what am I to get?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then what is it? You cannot <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{be happy}} to hear you {{complaining}} of headache every day,--making it an excuse for absolute idleness." ...|$|R
500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's {{going to do a}} great job and I'll just look forward to working with him. I'm still really young in the [...] job as well and very inexperienced at this level, so I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> learn a lot off him." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said to me after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{love you}} as {{honestly}} and as firmly as a younger one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that if you}} could bring yourself to be my wife, you would find {{that you would not}} be treated badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What kind word <b>can</b> <b>I</b> speak {{when you}} {{have told me that}} you do not love me? Do you <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> forget that because--because he has gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know exactly, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find out," [...] {{answered}} the sneak. He felt much subdued, especially {{as he saw}} {{the eyes of many}} of the other cadets on him.|$|R
