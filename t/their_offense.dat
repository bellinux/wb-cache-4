5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} air as the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost half <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> on the ground. The end result of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however. Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

The Crimson Tide then forced a Tigers' punt on their second possession, and then scored their third touchdown in as many possessions when AJ McCarron threw a 37-yard pass to Amari Cooper for a 21–0 lead early in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the LSU Tigers at Tuscaloosa 38–17. After LSU forced an Alabama punt {{on their first}} possession, they proceeded to drive 79-yards to the Crimson Tide three-yard line. On the next play, Tana Patrick forced a J. C. Copeland fumble at the one-yard line that prevented a Tigers' score. The ball was recovered by Landon Collins and gave the Crimson Tide possession at their 10-yard line. After the LSU defense forced a second punt, <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> had their second turnover of the game when a Zach Mettenberger fumble was recovered by Trey DePriest at the Tigers' 27-yard line. Four plays later, Alabama took a 3–0 lead on a 41-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{had their}} first test in the opening week Monday Night Football game against the {{defending}} Eastern Division champion Dallas Cowboys. Playing in front of 59,804 fans at Texas Stadium, the Giants lost the opener, 31–28. The teams played fairly evenly statistically; the Giants totalled 416yards to the Cowboys' 392. Highlights of the game included Cowboys running back Herschel Walker, in his first NFL game, rushing 10 times for 64yards and the game-winning touchdown, and fellow running back Tony Dorsett scoring on a 36-yard screen pass on the game's opening drive. The Giants struggled {{at the start of}} the game; they failed to get a first down on their first three drives, but <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> came alive and scored 28 points in the final three quarters.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with <b>their</b> <b>offense,</b> they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched.

5|$|Indiana's {{first play}} on the new drive was stopped for a loss, and the Hoosiers were forced to punt after a short gain was nullified by a Paci sack on third down. The kick was a short one, and Tech began its second drive from IU's 49-yard line. The first play was stopped for no gain, DeShazo threw two {{incomplete}} passes, and Virginia Tech punted after going three and out. Indiana recovered the ball at its 23-yard line, where <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> began work. A five-yard false start penalty against the Hoosiers pushed them back, and Indiana was stopped for little gain {{on the first two}} plays of its drive. On the third play, however, Paci connected on a 75-yard pass to Thomas Lewis, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown and the game's first points. Following the extra point kick, Indiana had a 70 lead with 5:36 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on <b>their</b> <b>offense,</b> which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers on defense and in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck back with an Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, and held {{on to win the}} game 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. The crowd of 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham had his hand stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E

Sexual arousal in response to older adult women or peers was deemed age appropriate; sexual arousal in response to significantly younger females was deemed inappropriate. Many of the juveniles who denied responsibility for <b>their</b> <b>offenses</b> showed no sexual arousal at all—however about one-third still showed age inappropriate arousal despite denying responsibility for <b>their</b> <b>offenses.</b>|$|R

5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out with solid defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

The next day in the last regular season game, two home runs were hit off Hoffman before he saved a 7–6 {{win over the}} Diamondbacks, earning the Padres their second consecutive NL West title. He was named MLB Delivery Man of the Month for September after being 10for11 in save opportunities and striking out 13 batters over 12.0 innings and allowing only seven hits. Hoffman saved 46 of 51 save chances on the year, and led the NL in saves {{for the second time}}. His 11th 30-save season set an MLB record, while his eighth 40-save season extended his record. His season save total was the second highest in his career. Hoffman won the Rolaids Relief Award {{for the second time in}} his career, was awarded The Sporting News NL Reliever of the Year for the third time, and finished as the runner-up for the Cy Young Award for the second time. In the playoffs, the Padres faced the Cardinals in the NLDS again. Down 2–0 in the series, Hoffman saved Game 3 in a 3–1 win to avoid elimination. However, the Padres lost the series 3–1 as <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> managed only six runs in the four games against the eventual 2006 World Series champions.|$|E
5|$|UCF got {{the ball}} to start the game at their nine-yard line after a penalty on the kickoff return, and their junior quarterback Blake Bortles orchestrated an {{efficient}} drive in which he converted two third downs and was 6/7 passing for 65 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to Storm Johnson. Penn State took over and got two first downs, the latter of which as a fourth down conversion, before a 44-yard pass to Allen Robinson immediately followed by a 6-yard touchdown run by Zach Zwinak to tie the game. Penn State moved the ball on their next drive, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs giving UCF good field position, with which they ran a two play drive culminating with a 58-yard touchdown run by Johnson to make it 14–7 UCF. Penn State's special teams responded with a 44-yard kickoff return by Geno Lewis, but <b>their</b> <b>offense</b> went three-and-out, and though they punted the ball deep into UCF territory, the Knights marched down the field with a strong running game and scored another touchdown to go up 21–7. On Penn State's ensuing drive, Sam Ficken kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal. UCF got some decent yardage on their next drive, but Bortles threw his first interception since October 27, 2012 with 1:17 in the half, but they ran down the clock and Ficken missed his first field goal attempt of the season, a 57-yard try as time expired. At the half, UCF had 290 total yards including 170 rushing yards, compared to 220 total yards for Penn State with only 89 rushing yards. Penn State {{got the ball}} to start the second half, but punted on their first drive. UCF responded with a touchdown via a 25-yard pass. Penn State came right back with a touchdown of their own. UCF's ensuing drive {{brought them to the}} one yard line, but Penn State held them to a field goal, making the score 31–17. Zwinak rushed for his third touchdown of the game on Penn State's next drive, and Shawn Moffitt kicked his second field goal of the game. Penn State drove 51 yards on their next drive before Zwinak lost a fumble with 5:43 remaining in the game. UCF went three-and-out, and on their punt, the snap went over the punter's head, and Penn State got the ball at the UCF 25. Penn State took advantage, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 57 seconds left. Penn State needed to regain possession of the ball after the score, and failed to do so, so ultimately UCF held on to win by three.|$|E
