[...] On the other hand, Dallas Stewart, trainer of rival Commanding Curve, dismissed California Chrome's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races. Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California. In contrast to the critics, reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $10million.|$|E

[...] Justin Chang of Variety noted that [...] "a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that she's <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal,</b> delivering a deliciously feisty performance".

500|$|Fleming stated he was {{impressed}} by Love's [...] "focus and intensity," [...] especially while recording vocals for one song when Love [...] "literally ripped her clothes off while she sang". [...] "Courtney was amazing", said Fleming. [...] "She was the most gung-ho person I've ever met. She {{was going to make}} the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio.

I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal.</b> They were Hollywood misfits—all of them.

500|$|Special effects makeup {{designer}} David White took {{head and}} body casts of actors, such as Bautista, {{to experiment with}} materials used to create the characters. White said, [...] "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal</b> there on set." [...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Allmusic {{contributor}} Gregory Heaney {{gave the}} album an overall score of {{three out of}} a possible five, noting that the lyrics [...] "feel more genuinely personal than his earlier work", and that [...] "there's a real sense of urgent catharsis at work". He concludes, [...] " [...] combination of a tight, talented band and a tortured frontman doesn't necessarily make Falling in Reverse a revelatory band, but is does make The Drug in Me Is You a very solid album." [...] Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that [...] "he fell short big time", calling the album's music [...] "out of date and overdone". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, [...] "Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal.</b> The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate. Now he’s on the loose and up to no good with a new band — and a CD of post-hardcore anthems that render his foul-mouthed tales of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll with a mix of metalcore power and pop-punk melody. Lock up everything." ...|$|E

When Bobby finally realized he wasn't talking to a Dean shapeshifter or revenant , that this was <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal,</b> it was just awesome." [...] Charles was surprised by Bobby's paralysis storyline, but became [...] "really interested" [...] in finding out how it would affect him. However, she posited, [...] "The guy's a spitfire...and it probably won't change him much." [...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them {{that there is more}} to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done an outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby has run the gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Boyd joined Championship side Hull City on loan {{until the}} end of the 2012–13 season, with a view to a {{permanent}} move. He made his debut two days after signing, on 23 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Robert Koren in a 4–1 away defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Boyd's full debut came at home in the following match a week later, as he scored twice in a 5–2 victory over Birmingham City. After the performance, Hull manager Steve Bruce stated — [...] "It was a wonder show. His work-rate and intelligence – he looked <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>deal.</b> I've always been a big admirer, but I didn't know he was that good.

He scored in Hull's next match at the KC Stadium later that month, in a 2–1 loss to Nottingham Forest, who he failed a medical at in January, netting just before half-time when he flicked the ball over his shoulder with his back to goal. Boyd's fourth goal in six matches came on 30 March, scoring the only goal of the match as Hull secured a 1–0 away victory over Huddersfield Town, an inch perfect ball played through by Jay Simpson found Boyd on the edge of the box, who clinically fired a first time strike into the keepers' top left corner. He played regularly for the remainder of the campaign, including in Hull's 2–2 home draw with Cardiff City on the last day of the season, the match that ultimately secured the club's promotion back to the Premier League. During his loan spell, Boyd made thirteen appearances and scored four times.|$|E
