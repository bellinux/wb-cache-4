5|$|The {{surviving}} {{residential buildings}} at Gedi are all {{located within the}} inner wall and {{are representative of the}} living conditions of the elite members of Gedi society, since {{the majority of the population}} lived in the mud thatched dwellings outside the city's core. <b>The</b> four largest <b>houses</b> include <b>the</b> <b>House</b> on <b>the</b> Wall, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> on <b>the</b> West Wall, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dhow, and <b>the</b> Large <b>House.</b> A cluster <b>of</b> smaller <b>houses</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> palace or Sheiks residence includes <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Cash, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Porcelain Bowl, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cistern, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Two Rooms, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paneled Walls, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scissors, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Venetian Bead, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunken Court, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cowries, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iron Lamp, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iron Box, and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Well.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives {{has several}} powers {{not given to}} <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors. If a bill is passed by <b>the</b> lower <b>house</b> (<b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives) but is voted down by <b>the</b> upper <b>house</b> (<b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors) <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives can {{override}} <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors by a two-thirds vote in the affirmative. However, {{in the case of}} treaties, the budget, and the selection of the prime minister, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can only delay passage, but not block the legislation. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives is considered <b>the</b> more powerful <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors (Sangiin) is <b>the</b> upper <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Diet <b>of</b> Japan. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives is <b>the</b> lower <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors is <b>the</b> {{successor}} to <b>the</b> pre-war <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Peers. If <b>the</b> two <b>houses</b> disagree {{on matters of}} the budget, treaties, or designation of the prime minister, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives can insist on its decision. In other decisions, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives can override a vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors only by a two-thirds majority of members present.|$|R
5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, {{to make them look}} older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
5|$|Given to the City of London by Moore and the Contemporary Art Society in 1967, Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65 is {{displayed}} in Abingdon Street Gardens, opposite <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, where its regular {{appearance in the}} background of televised news reports from Westminster makes it Moore's most prominent piece in Britain. The ownership of Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65 was disputed until its 2011 acquisition by the Parliamentary Art Collection.|$|E
5|$|Guy Fawkes, who {{was born}} and educated in York, {{was a member of}} a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot.

50|$|Each branch, {{along with}} their {{legitimate}} sub-branches, forms a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> France.

5|$|Immigrants {{have not}} always been readily {{accepted}} and in 1517 the Evil May Day riots, where foreign-owned property was attacked, resulted in the deaths of 135 Flemings in Stepney.

5|$|In London, an anti-Trump rally {{was held}} outside <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament as House of Commons debated whether Trump {{should be allowed}} to visit the United Kingdom.

5|$|Not {{fooled by}} the Viceroy's communiqué, some criollos met at <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> Nicolás Rodríguez Peña and Martín Rodríguez.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives is <b>the</b> more {{powerful}} {{chamber of the}} Diet. While <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives cannot usually overrule <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors on a bill, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can only delay {{the adoption of a}} budget or a treaty that has been approved by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives, and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors has almost no power at all to prevent <b>the</b> lower <b>house</b> from selecting any Prime Minister it wishes. Furthermore, once appointed it is <b>the</b> confidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives alone that the Prime Minister must enjoy in order to continue in office. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives can overrule <b>the</b> upper <b>house</b> in <b>the</b> following circumstances: ...|$|R
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors can cause <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives to reconsider its decision. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Councillors, on <b>the</b> advice of the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by <b>the</b> Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Representatives before <b>the</b> Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|R

The hotel includes the Hamilton Rooms, named after former GER chairman Lord Claud Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament of the United Kingdom {{presented}} a loyal address to Queen Elizabeth II in 1965 {{to mark the}} 700th anniversary of Montfort's Parliament, and the Queen addressed both Houses of Parliament.

Some of these documents were displayed again in a 2015 exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The cellars under <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament {{continued}} to be leased out to private individuals until 1678, when news of the Popish Plot broke.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Burgesses became <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates in 1776, forming <b>the</b> lower <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly, the {{legislative}} branch of the Commonwealth <b>of</b> Virginia. Through <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Burgesses, <b>the</b> Virginia <b>House</b> <b>of</b> Delegates is considered the oldest continuous legislative body in the New World.|$|R

5|$|The great {{majority}} of the art in and around <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of acquiring British art for the building.

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into <b>the</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E
