Catch and effort statistics were ob-tained for the years 1915 through 1951, from various sources, for the gill-net fishery which catches more than 95 percent of the shad in the Hudson River. A <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> <b>during</b> 1951 gave estimates of the total shad populat. ion entering the river that year. The total run and the escapement (since the catch was known) werc then calculated for each year from 1915 through 1950. Age analysis of a sample of the catch of 1950 and 1951 showed that most shad returned as adults to the river at 4 and 5 years of age. Also, about 50 percent of the fish had previously spawned. It was shown that about 85 percent of the variation in size of the run between 1920 and 1951 could be attributed {{to the size of the}} escapement from the fishery.

50|$|Some {{well known}} <b>tagging</b> <b>programs</b> in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> and the Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program.</b> The South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> began in 1974 {{and it is}} now the largest public <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they tag a fish, anglers use a reply {{postcard}} they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a tagged fish, he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|R

Whether enrollment caps at colleges posed a barrier for applicants is unclear. In the program's first year, 516 of the nearly 2, 500 eligible applicants did not use the grants. About 21 percent of the institutions in which applicants expressed interest restrict the number of out-of-state students that they will accept, although the extent to which this played a role in limiting access to these institutions is unclear.

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} a recreational fisherman 2 ̆ 7 s choice to participate in citizen fish <b>tagging</b> <b>programs</b> by identifying factors that influence participation in these programs and by exploring three alternative causal models for explaining participation in fish tagging projects: a values-beliefs-norms (VBN) model, a values-attitudes-behavior (VAB) model, and a full theoretical model including socio-demographic and explanatory variables. One hundred recreational fishermen in Plum Island, Massachusetts were given a written survey designed to investigate their experiences with <b>tagging</b> <b>programs,</b> along with their attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs regarding such programs. Responses to the survey were compared between participants and non-participants. Survey items were then used to create behavioral variable indexes and were correlated to a willingness-to-participate index. Three psycho-social behavioral models (VBN, VAB, and the full model) were built and compared to determine which model best fits the data. Although few variables distinguished participants from non-participants in volunteer fish <b>tagging</b> <b>programs,</b> several important factors strongly influenced willingness to participate. Subjective norms, personal obligation, and personal commitment all strongly correlated with willingness to participate. A comparison of three alternative causal models showed that the use of a full theoretical model, including different psycho-social variables as well as demographic and situational factors, provided the best fit for this behavior. Additionally, the modeled data showed that the strongest direct influence of willingness to participate in a volunteer fish <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> was personal commitment; while perceptions of positive outcomes were a result, rather than a determinant of participation. This suggests that attempting to increase fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge regarding fish <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> through educational programs, as is commonly suggested in public engagement literature, is not an optimal strategy. Program scientists and managers could increase participation by reaching out through social networks in order to find fishermen who share a strong sense of personal commitment to their fishery and the areas in which they fish. ...|$|R

Advantages and disadvantages of each type of tags are presented. Statistical analysis are based on GLM and randomization tests. Return rates, recapture’s locations, growth rates and times at liberty are compared between both tags for three tuna species (yellowfin, skipjack and bigeye). Results conclude to a lower efficiency of BETYP tags. For instance, recapture rate and time at liberty for bigeye as well as growth rate for yellowfin are significatively lower when one uses BETYP tags. However, there is no significative {{difference between the two}} types of tags for these parameters for skipjack. Finally, the implementation of BETYP tags is not well suited to intensive tropical tuna <b>tagging</b> <b>programs,</b> as it is then necessary to tag the greatest possible number of fish during a limited time period.

The recruitment of gifted Hispanic English language learners (ELLs) for talented and gifted (<b>TAG)</b> <b>programs</b> {{is but one}} of the many unsettled issues which plague school districts nationwide. The pervasive underrepresentation of this group in TAG education is particularly unacceptable since Hispanics (1) represent the largest and fastest growing minority group; (2) continue to suffer a devastatingly high dropout rate of 30 % as compared to whites 8 % and blacks 13 %; (3) are more likely to come from economically disadvantaged (ED) families; and, (4) belong to one of the least likely minority groups to receive TAG education (Hispanic Dropout Project, 1996). As, noted in the Jacob K. Javits Act, “Students with talent are found in all cultural groups, across all economic strata, and in all areas of human endeavor” (p. 1) and therefore can certainly be found among Hispanic ELLs (P. L. 100 – 297). ^ The purpose of this research was to conduct a detailed study of the process used by an exemplary <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> to identify, nominate, and accept Hispanic kindergarten ELLs for TAG Education. A social constructivist perspective of the identification process used by a school district such as the Park City School System served to provide an in depth description of the sociocultural context of a <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> which (1) is strongly committed to identifying and serving students as early as the kindergarten level; (2) is based on philosophies and policies of inclusion with respect to Hispanic ELLs; and, (3) refrains from relying heavily on standardized test scores to identify students. ^ Ethnographic techniques were used with a total of 16 participants from both Bilingual and <b>TAG</b> <b>Programs.</b> Data collected from various sources revealed the critical components of an exemplary <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> to include: consistent financial support from A Board of Education and Superintendent of Schools; Ownership of the Program; a curriculum which fosters high order critical thinking skills; capable, dedicated, and knowledgeable staff members representative of the community they serve; and the use of a labor intensive identification system which employs a variety of criteria to identify students. ...|$|R

The <b>TAg</b> <b>program</b> specifically is an experiential, hands-on season-long training program for small groups of field crop producers in local areas. The <b>TAg</b> <b>program</b> has been used successfully in New York State to teach producers to better manage field crops, protect the environment, reduce health risks, and enhance their own long-term viability by implementing specific targeted IPM and ICM practices.
