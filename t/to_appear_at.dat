5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> the lips.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared.

Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>at</b> meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E
