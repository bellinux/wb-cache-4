5|$|After the {{calendar}} stories, Hebel wrote Biblische Geschichten (Bible stories), {{a new school}} book for evangelical religious education. His criteria were {{that it should be}} clearly written and tell biblical stories in an exciting narrative style aimed at children from ten to fourteen.

5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but <b>took</b> <b>five</b> catches in the slips.|$|E

5|$|Having {{developed}} a slower ball, {{and using the}} yorker more sparingly, Ambrose <b>took</b> <b>five</b> wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.|$|E

He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals.|$|E
5|$|Jonze <b>took</b> <b>five</b> {{months to}} write {{the first draft of}} the script, his first {{screenplay}} written alone.

5|$|The {{coronation}} {{usually takes}} place {{several months after}} the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough time to complete the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey <b>took</b> <b>five</b> months.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were further magnified in late 2006, when Pathan conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, Pathan was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he <b>took</b> <b>five</b> wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E

5|$|A {{frontline}} leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not {{prominent in}} the team's success. Although he had started his Test career strongly, McCool's form began to decline in the previous Australian season of 194748. In his first full Test season in 194647, which featured five Tests against England, McCool batted at No. 6 and scored 95 and 104 not out. He also <b>took</b> <b>five</b> wickets in an innings on two occasions. He ended the series with 272 runs {{at an average of}} 54.40 and took 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece. However, in the following season he made only 46 runs and took only three wickets in three Tests against India before being dropped. Nevertheless, McCool started the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, and was selected in the tour opener against Worcestershire and later against the MCC in his role as an all rounder.|$|E
5|$|Across the Philippines, {{the storm}} caused $4.48million (1987USD) in damage but no deaths. Although the system stayed {{offshore}} Taiwan, the storm inflicted widespread flooding across the island that <b>took</b> <b>five</b> lives. There, 5,000families were left without power, and damage exceeded $10million. Although Gerald weakened considerably prior to making landfall, {{the storm was}} still responsible for extensive damage in the Fujian Province, where 76people perished, and 31others suffered injuries. In the neighboring Zhejiang Province, 28people were killed and 71others sustained injuries. Across China, 4,900homes were destroyed and 122fatalities were reported. Damage in the country amounted to $120million.|$|E
5|$|After a gap {{of three}} weeks with no cricket, Allen took six wickets {{in his first}} match back. Meanwhile, Larwood was ruled out of the England team after an injury in a car crash; Allen played in the second Test and <b>took</b> <b>five</b> for 14 in New Zealand's first innings. England won that game, and the next was drawn after rain washed out the first two days; Allen neither batted nor bowled. In the series, he took eight wickets {{at an average of}} 16.12. He ended the season with 401 {{first-class}} runs at 30.84 and 40 wickets at 18.77.|$|E
