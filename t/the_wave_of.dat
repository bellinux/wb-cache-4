5|$|By {{shutting}} down Black Snow and prosecuting Takechi, Eirin {{had intended to}} suppress the new pink film genre, but the trial had the exact opposite outcome. The publicity surrounding the trial brought the pink film genre {{to the attention of}} the general public, and helped inspire <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Before the 19th century {{there were}} no {{universities}} in Northern England. The University of Durham was founded in 1832, and is sometimes counted with the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge, although it post-dates them by many centuries. The next universities built in the North were part of <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> redbrick universities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, there are seven Northern institutions in the Russell Group of leading research universities: Durham, the redbricks of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield and the later plate glass university of York. These universities, together with plate-glass Lancaster, form the N8 Research Partnership.|$|E
5|$|Even after <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> {{publicity}} {{that followed}} its reemergence, The Wood Nymph remains rarely recorded {{compared to other}} early Sibelius works. It received its world premiere in 1996 under the BIS label with Osmo Vänskä leading the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. Some musical material was unavailable until {{the publication of the}} Breitkopf & Härtel JSW critical edition in 2006 and was thus not included on prior recordings. The 1888 version for voice and piano has been recorded by Anne Sophie von Otter. Erik Tawaststjerna also recorded the piano solo version together with the rest of Sibelius's piano transcriptions. The 1996 Vänskä recording also included the first recording of the melodrama, narrated by Lasse Pöysti.|$|E

5|$|Following the NDH's establishment, Đujić {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Ustaše. As {{early as}} April, Đujić's Chetnik's began killing and mutilating Croats {{in retaliation for}} <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Ustaše atrocities against Serb communities across the NDH around the same time. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month, centered mainly around Knin. By mid-month, his Chetniks were launching raids against communist-held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar {{in conjunction with the}} Italians, who considered him a filibuster. His Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings, sparing the local Serb population from further massacres.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Takechi {{entered the}} film {{industry}} by producing controversial soft-core theatrical pornography. His 1964 film Daydream was the first big-budget, mainstream pink film released in Japan. After the release of his 1965 film Black Snow, the government arrested him on indecency charges. The trial became a public battle over censorship between Japan's intellectuals and the government. Takechi won the lawsuit, enabling <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> softcore pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema during the 1960s and 1970s. In the later 1960s, Takechi produced three more pink films.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{attacks on}} Christians in {{southern}} Karnataka refer to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> attacks directed against Christian churches and prayer halls in the Indian city of Mangalore {{and the surrounding}} area of southern Karnataka in September and October 2008 by Hindu extremist organisations, Bajrang Dal and the Sri Ram Sena. The attacks were widely perceived by Christians in southern Karnataka to be punishment from right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations because they had been outspoken about Christian persecution in Orissa, after the assassination of Hindu monk Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati allegedly by local christian community and also because the New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT), a non-denominational Christian Church, was alleged by Bajrang Dal to be responsible for forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The Limousin breed {{was also}} not immune to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the agricultural society of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were most consistent with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their working animals, as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> anti-Chinese {{violence}} in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, {{to the state of}} Oregon. Mobs drove Chinese workers out of small towns throughout the state in late 1885 and mid-1886. Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as Augusta, Georgia, anger was expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to The New York Times, the rioting in Rock Springs fueled the desire of anti-Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.|$|E

5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Han {{became a}} {{full-time}} sculptor in 1997. Her works {{can be found}} around the world: Childhood Dream (1992) at the Uchinomi-cho Town Hall Garden {{on the island of}} Shōdoshima in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan; Pisces (1993) at the Yashiro Hoshi-no Choukoku Centre Park in Osaka, Japan; Spirit of Nature III (1990) at the Kuching Waterfront Development in Sarawak, Malaysia; Towards Peace (1987) in the Kuala Lumpur Lake Gardens, Malaysia; and Cactus, Tropical Leaves (both 1994) and <b>The</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>of</b> Life at the Embassy of Singapore in Washington, D.C. In Singapore, sculptures commissioned from her can be seen at Capital Tower (Shimmering Pearls I, 1999), the Defence Science Organisation National Laboratories (Tropical Brain Forest, 2003), the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay (Seed Series, 1998), the National Museum of Singapore (20 Tonnes, 2002; and Seeds, 2006), One Marina Boulevard (Progressive Flows, 2004), Orchard MRT Station (Goddess of Happiness, 1985), Revenue House (Spring, 1996), Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3 (Flora Inspiration, 2007), Singapore Changi Airport VIP Complex (Singapore – A Garden City, 2004), Suntec City Mall (Chinese Zodiac Medallions, 1995), UOB Plaza (Two Figures, 1993), and Woodlands Regional Library (Rain Forest).|$|E
5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of}} the Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} towards Christianity {{began again}} in the late 6th and 7th centuries, helped by {{the conversion of the}} Franks in Northern France, who carried considerable influence in England. Pope Gregory I sent a team of missionaries to convert King Æthelberht of Kent and his household, starting the process of converting Kent. Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and started to build new churches across the South-East, reusing existing pagan shrines. Oswald and Oswiu, kings of Northumbria, were converted in the 630s and 640s, and <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> change carried on through the middle of the 7th century across the kingdoms of Mercia, the South Saxons and the Isle of Wight. The process was largely complete {{by the end of the}} 7th century, but left a confusing and disparate array of local practices and religious ceremonies. This new Christianity reflected the existing military culture of the Anglo-Saxons: as kings began to convert in the 6th and 7th centuries, conversion began to be used as a justification for war against the remaining pagan kingdoms, for example, while Christian saints were imbued with martial properties.|$|E
5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was shot at a high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed its windows being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|E

Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the Aliens Act through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire. During this meeting, he asked what Weizmann's objections {{had been to the}} 1903 Uganda Scheme that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of British East Africa to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by Joseph Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary in Balfour's Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as the Jews are to Jerusalem.|$|E
