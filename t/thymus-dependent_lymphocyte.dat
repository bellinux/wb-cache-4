Total leucocyte, lymphocyte and T-cell levels were significantly elevated in smokers. There was no correlation with age. LR to PHA was significantly higher in smokers less than 40 years of age or in those with a 20 pack-year or less history of cigarette consumption. Older smokers or those with a history of heavier cigarette consumption did not differ from normals. The results contrast with previous demonstrations of suppression of immune reactivity after exposure to tobacco products.

40|$|Bone marrow {{cells from}} a patient with severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency were studied in vitro for <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T cell) differentiation by using, at varying times, thymic epithelial monolayers and culture supernatants, thymopoietin, ubiquitin, and thymic extract as inducing agents. On initial evaluation, with thymopoietin or human thymic extract, only a partial differentiation of marrow cells was achieved into cells bearing the human T cell antigenicity without the capacity to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, suggesting that the stem cells were defective. Two fetal liver transplantations aimed at reconstitution were unsuccessful, despite evidence of chimerism. Induction studies at that time demonstrated rosetting capacity (with sheep erythrocytes) of the patient's bone marrow cells after coculture with thymic epithelial monolayers but not with their supernatants. An 18 -week fetal thymus (irradiated) was then transplanted, but the transplantation was unsuccessful and no clear evidence of chimerism was demonstrated. Subsequently, transplantation of another fetal liver resulted in chimerism and immunologic reconstitution. Serum thymic factor activity rose from 1 : 2 before transplantation to 1 : 16 after reconstitution. The combined use of fetal thymus and liver may provide effective immunological reconstitution in some variants of severe combined immunodeficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{differentially}} test {{the function of}} lymphocytes in Toxoplasma gondii-infected mice, the in vitro blastogenic response of spleen cell cultures to non-specific mitogens was studied. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation were used as tests of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T cell) function and bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{was used as a}} probe of bursal equivalent lymphocyte (B cell) function. For the first 3 weeks following T. gondii infection, the uptake of tritiated thymidine ([3 H]TdR) by spleen cells cultured with all three mitogens was markedly reduced in comparison to the uptake in spleen cells from uninfected control mice. Thereafter, the response to LPS returned to normal while stimulation by the T-cell mitogens (PHA and Con A) remained depressed. It is postulated that T. gondii infection either: (1) diluted out T cells in the spleen with unreactive cells; (2) modified T cells {{in such a way that}} they were less responsive to mitogens; (3) depleted the peripheral lymphoid tissues of T cells; (4) induced non-specific suppressor cells, which inhibited the T-cell function assays; or (5) activated macrophages which depressed T-cell function non-specifically...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> for antibody production to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia akari, Rickettsia conorii, and Rickettsia typhi was investigated by comparing antibody production in athymic (nu/nu) or thymus-bearing BALB/c mice. Athymic BALB/c mice produced antibody after infection with R. akari, R. conorii, and R. typhi {{as measured by}} indirect fluorescent antibody titration or radioimmunoassay. Antibody production in these mice was a great or greater than in the thymus-bearing mice and demonstrated similar kinetics. In contrast, athymic BALB/c mice infected either intraperitoneally or subcutaneously with the Gilliam strain of R. tsutsugamushi failed to produce demonstrable antibody. The {{requirement of}} <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> for antibody production to R. tsutsugamushi was further suggested by the demonstration of antibody production after transfer of immune <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to athymic mice and the demonstration of R. tsutsugamushi-specific T helper cells in immune thymus-bearing mice. The antibody produced in athymic mice after infection with R. akari, R. conorii, and R. typhi was predominantly immunoglobulin M, based on isotype-specific radioimmunoassays and sucrose gradient fractionation. Furthermore, the antibody produced by athymic mice in response to R. akari infection reacted with a carbohydrate-containing outer membrane component...|$|R

The patients were subjects of a trial {{of the value of}} craniospinal irradiation in the third month of treatment in preventing central nervous system relapse. Effects of both irradiation and chemotherapy were observed. Lymphopenia was much more marked in those patients who had received irradiation over a year previously. Assays of response to phytohaemagglutinin (P. H. A.) and staining for surface immunoglobulin indicated that this difference was due to a deficiency in <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the irradiated children. Chemotherapy had a particularly marked depressant effect on lymphocytes with antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity and a proportion of PHA-responsive cells were also depressed.

40|$|Induction of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T cell) {{differentiation}} {{was performed}} in vitro with thymic factors as inducers. T cell precursors from human bone marrow first expressed surface differentiation antigens and then acquired the capacity to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. The latter marker could not be induced when cells with differentiation antigens had been eliminated. The proliferative responses to phytomitogens or to allogeneic stimuli appeared to be characteristics of later stages in differentiation that also can be induced or amplified by in vitro incubation of marrow cells or thymocytes with thymic factors. When phytomitogen-responsive cells from peripheral blood were inactivated in vitro, the allogeneic response was enhanced. Although these responses are acquired almost concomitantly, they are therefore envisioned to be characteristics of separate T cell subsets. After immunological reconstitution of patients, the T cell development in vivo involves a succession of differentiation events similar to that described above. Our experiments with mice, using similar methods, have also shown that graft-versus-host inducing capacity {{is a function of}} a cell population distinct from that which yields a proliferative response to in vitro stimulation by phytohemagglutinin. These results support our model of sequential differentiation of human prothymocytes into various subsets of mature T cells...|$|E

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of thymosin beta 4, a polypeptide isolated from calf thymus, was determined. Thymosin beta 4 is composed of 43 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 4982 and an isoelectric point of 5. 1. The NH 2 terminus of the peptide is blocked by an acetyl group. This molecule induces expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (DNA nucleotidylexotransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 31) in transferase-negative murine thymocytes in vivo and in citro. Thus, it appears that thymosin beta 4 acts on lymphoid stem cells and may control {{the early stages of}} the maturation process of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> This peptide is one of several present in thymosin fraction 5 that participates in the regulation, differentiation, and function of thymus-dependent thymocytes...|$|R

When the lymphocytes of patients with AH were incubated in the presence of thymosin fraction 5, the subsequent number and proportion of rosette-forming T lymphocytes showed a significant increase. There was no significant reponse to thymosin in CAC or in control subjects. There appears to be a subset of immature T lymphocytes in patients with AH that is responsive to exogenous thymic factors with subsequent activation of the capacity to form spontaneous rosettes...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} method to investigate pulmonary granuloma {{formation in the}} guinea pig was established. Animals sensitized to human serum albumin (HSA) and challenged intravenously with HSA covalently linked to Sepharose 2 B beads developed a specific granulomatous response. This intense pulmonary arterial, focally necrotizing, but mainly granulomatous inflammatory reaction developed 5 to 7 days after {{the administration of the}} HSA-bead conjugate. Unsensitized animals did not show such extensive inflammation, but rather exhibited a typical foreign body reaction to the bead. In both the experimental and control groups, the inflammatory response was indistinguishable at 14 and 21 days. Thus the initial acute inflammatory reaction was seen only in specifically sensitized animals. On the other hand, HSA alone produced no demonstrable inflammatory lesion. These observations suggest that locally retained antigen may trigger antigen-specific T (<b>thymus-dependent)</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to release mediators which contribute to granuloma formation...|$|R

In addition, mice develop reaginic, agglutinating, and early dermal reactive antibodies to SEA and a characteristic pattern of peripheral blood eosinophilia. In this study, depletion of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> abolished the anti-SEA lymphocyte blastogenic response and delayed dermal reactivity, reaginic antibody response and the major peak of peripheral blood eosinophilia, which in normal mice occurs {{at the same time as}} SEA-induced blastogenesis.

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for studying adoptive immunity to tuberculosis in syngeneic mice. Donor mice were immunized with 104 BCG intravenously, and lymphoid cells were harvested 28 days later.

Adoptive immunity was expressed optimally when recipients were sublethally irradiated (500 R), challenged with 104 to 105 viable organisms, and given sensitized lymphoid cells intravenously. Adoptive immunity was not manifest until 14 days after challenge and was effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv as well as BCG. Immunity could be conferred by spleen, lymph node, peritoneal exudate, and resident peritoneal (washout) cells.

40|$|Infection of rabbits with Treponema pallidum induces nonspecific {{acquired}} cellular resistance (ACR) to Listeria monocytogenes.

40|$|Present {{evidence}} indicates that the immune response to foreign tissues may involve several types of cellular cytotoxicity, including two mechanisms of lymphocyte-mediated killing which have been extensively studied in vitro. (a) Cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) is effected by cytotoxic T lymphocytes which interact with targets via specific receptors for cellular antigen. (b) Antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is effected by a small subpopulation of non-T lymphocytes (1 - 5), termed K cells, that interact with antibody (Ab) bound targets via receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (6, 7). In contrast to CML, K-cell ADCC does not require sensitization, and may therefore {{be considered to be}} "spontaneous". While this and other laboratories have reported that <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> do not effect ADCC (1 - 5), we have found that peripheral human T cells develop this activity when sensitized to alloantigen.

40|$|Some of the {{immunological}} {{effects of}} anti-lymphocytic globulin (ALG) {{were examined in}} patients {{taking part in a}} clinical study of equine ALG in ulcerative colitis. ALG administration led to reduction in the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes forming spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E rosettes). Evidence was obtained that this reduction was the result of genuine depletion of circulating T (<b>thymus-dependent)</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> rather than blockade of E-rosette formation by ALG on lymphocyte surfaces. Using an immunofluorescence technique, horse Ig was demonstrated on lymphocytes from patients receiving ALG. By combining this technique with E-rosette formation, horse Ig was detected on patients' E-rosette-positive and -negative lymphocytes. Horse Ig levels in patients' sera were measured by haemagglutination inhibition, and the sera were also examined for anti-lymphocytic antibodies.

By contrast, fourteen patients severely affected by extensive visceral disease showed reductions in both ADCC and PHA-induced cytotoxicity which were more marked in whole blood assays (P less than 0. 001) than in those performed with PBM (P less than 0. 05). The addition of patient's sera to control cytotoxicity assays suggested that blocking or suppressive serum factors could only account for some of the disproportionate reduction in whole blood cytotoxicity which, in the main, must be {{due to a lack of}} circulating effector cells.

40|$|Cooperative {{interactions}} between <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (T cells) and antibody-forming cell precursors {{derived from the}} bone marrow (B cells) are important for the stimulation of B cells by most soluble antigens (1 - 3).

Alternative mechanisms of secondary B cell stimulation are implied, however, by the finding that hapten on heterologous or poorly immunogenic carriers is also able to stimulate antibody formation (4 - 6). Recent {{studies have indicated that}} such stimulation can be the result of {{interactions between}} B and T cells both recognizing haptenic determinants (6 - 8). This demonstration of "hapten self-help " questions the notion of direct stimulation of secondary B cells independent of T cell participation.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{stage in}} the induction of antibody responses is the interaction of antigen molecules with the surface receptors of immunocompetent cells.

The differences between the pattern of antigen binding to nonthymus-dependent lymphocytes (B cells) 1 in immunity and tolerance are not fully understood. Recently, {{attempts were made to}} study this problem in tissue culture, using dinitrophenylated polymeric flagellin (DNP POL) as antigen (1). The interaction of antigen molecules with cell membranes may be readily studied in dissociated lymphoid cell populations in vitro, where antigen concentrations are relatively uniform and catabolism negligible compared with tile situation in vivo (2). Furthermore, since tile response to DNP POL in vitro does not require the participation of either <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (T cells) (1, 3) carrier-reactive cells, or macrophages (4, 5), only the pattern of reaction of DNP POL molecules with B cells determines the ensuing immunological events.

40|$|A central {{problem in}} {{cellular}} immunology is the elucidation {{of the nature}} of the antigen receptor molecules on the surface of <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (T cells).

However direct attempts to demonstrate immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules on the surface of T cells by immunofluorescence, cytotoxic, or autoradiographic methods have either been unsuccessful or have detected only small amounts of immunoglobulin (5 - 9). This is consistent with results of experiments that indicate that T cells have many fewer antigen-binding sites than do B cells (10). Indirect evidence in support of the notion that Ig molecules act as antigen-recognition sites on T cells has come from the demonstration that in some instances anti-Ig sera can interfere with antigen-binding and certain functions ascribed to T cells (11 - 15). In both the direct and indirect experiments only immunoglobulin light chain determinants have been detected with any consistency on T cells. This has led some investigators to postulate that the antigen receptors on T cells are immunoglobuli...|$|R

Another cell type, whose nature and function are rather poorly understood within the immune system, is the natural killer (NK) 2 cell (6, 7). NK cells do not have immunological memory and are present at high levels without prior priming. They may therefore represent an important first defense against newly arising neoplastic cells. The literature has suggested that, although NK cells recognize a large variety of apparently unrelated targets, there may be distinct cell surface antigens with which NK effector cells interact.

In addition to the complexity ofIr gene interaction, there is no definite evidence indicating which cell type(s) express Ir gene functions. It {{is not at all clear}} whether some or all Ir genes are expressed in bone marrow-derived antibody-forming cell precursors (B cells) and/or in <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (T cells) required for carrier recognition and helper cell function in the humoral immune response (1, 5 - 7). Further, it would appear that I-subregion identity between B and T cells may be required for effective B-cell-T-cell collaboration (8 - 10) and/or induction to IgG antibody synthesis (11), even for antigens that are apparently not under Ir gene control. The I region also determines the structure of a series of polymorphic cell surface molecules designated Ia, forI-region-associated antigens (2). Ia antigen...|$|R
40|$|Since 1957 (1 - 4) {{antibodies}} against nuclear antigens {{and particularly}} against DNA {{have been recognized}} in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Such autoantibodies have also been found in sera from NZB x NZW F 1 hybrid mice (5, 6), which spontaneously develop an autoimmune disease resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus (7, 8). The pathogenetic role of DNA and of antibodies directed against DNA (anti-DNA antibodies), particularly in kidney injury, has been suggested both in human (9) and in animal pathology (6). This hypothesis has been further s~lpported by the finding that NZB x NZW F 1 hybrid mice that had been previously rendered tolerant to denatured DNA failed to develop glomerulonephritis (10). The spontaneous development of anti-DNA autoantibodies is still poorly understood. The triggering of the immune response to DNA could result from antigenic stimulation by antigens containing DNA in a particularly immunogenic state. It is likely that in mice this response is genetically controlled (11, 12). However, {{it is possible that}} this response is modulated by <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> or by modifications of the immune status of the host, possibly induced by exogenous agents such as viruses or bacteria. Therefore...|$|R
40|$|Colony-stimulating {{activity}} (CSA) {{is essential}} for in vitro differentiation of bone marrow cells into colonies of granulocytes and mononuclear cells. While blood monocytes and macrophages are {{a major source of}} CSA, recent studies have indicated that CSA may be produced by lymphocytes responding to immunologic stimulation. Lymphocytes, purified from spleens and thymuses of mice by glass wool columns, were incubated in CMRL- 1066 medium with fetal calf serum in vitro. Lymphocytes from the thumus and spleen released CSA when cultured in vitro, with peak levels of CSA observed after 7 days of incubation. Stimulation of cultures with phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed mitogen resulted in a 2 - 5 -fold increase in CSA release, with peak levels of CSA released after 4 days of incubation. <b>Thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were responsible for the release of CSA from unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated cultures, since the incubation of these cultures with rabbit anti-mouse T cell sera abolished their ability to release CSA. Anti-mouse B cell sera had no effect on the ability of lymphocyte cultures to release CSA. These studies suggest that thymocytes and thymus-derived lymphocytes can release CSA in vitro and may be responsible for the increase in CSA observed in certain immunologic reactions...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{responses}} {{to a series of}} specific antigens are controlled by a group of immune response (Ir) 1 genes linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the species (1, 2). Thus, in inbred guinea pigs responsiveness to several antigens, including the 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) derivatives of poly-L-lysine, the DNP derivative of the copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-lysine (GL) and the copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-alanine (GA), are controlled by Ir genes linked to the strain 2 MHC while responsiveness to the copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-tyrosine (GT) is linked to the strain 13 MHC. We have recently demonstrated that alloantisera produced by immunizing strain 13 guinea pigs with strain 2 lymphoid tissue will block in vitro responses of primed (2 x 13) F, <b>thymus-dependent</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to DNP-GL and GA, and not to GT (3). Alloantisera with specificity for strain 13 alloantigens block responsiveness of (2 x 13) F, cells to GT, but not to DNP-GL or GA (4). This indicates that such alloantisera in some way specifically block the function of the Ir-gene product and suggests an important role for that gene product in antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. An analysis of the relative capacity of anti- 2 alloantisera to block responsiveness to G...|$|R
