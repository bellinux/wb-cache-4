5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had once}} {{been in love with}} her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E

A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and {{they are able to}} get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E

25|$|In October 2007, The National Enquirer began {{a series}} of reports alleging an adulterous affair between Edwards and former {{campaign}} worker Rielle Hunter. By July 2008, several news media outlets speculated that Edwards' chances for the Vice Presidency as well as other positions such as the Attorney General were harmed by the allegations, which now included that he fathered a child with Hunter and had visited her and the baby girl at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. However, the story was not widely covered by the press for some time, until, after initially denying the allegations, Edwards admitted the affair. On January 21, 2010, John Edwards issued a press release <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fathered Hunter's child.|$|E
25|$|Profumo's {{statement}} did {{not prevent}} newspapers publishing stories about Keeler, and it soon became apparent to Macmillan that Profumo's position was untenable. On 5 June 1963, Profumo was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lied to the House, an unforgivable offence in British politics. He resigned from office, from the House, and from the Privy Council. Before making his public confession Profumo confessed the affair to his wife, who stood by him. It was never shown that his relationship with Keeler had led to any breach of national security. The scandal rocked the Conservative government, and was generally held to {{have been among the}} causes of its defeat by Labour at the 1964 election. Macmillan had already gone by then, having resigned in October 1963 to be succeeded by Alec Douglas-Home.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after she wakes up, Paul sends Sophie to a rehab clinic in Sydney. Andrew {{purchases}} some medication online to control his epilepsy symptoms, which Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) advises him against taking. Chris is asked by his lawyer to collect witness statements from everyone involved in the crash, but Andrew refuses to give him one. However, Paul is forced to call off the lawsuit when Andrew admits that the crash was his fault. He makes up with Chris, while Summer and Natasha initially keep their distance. Sophie returns from rehab {{and is able to}} walk with the help of crutches, but she struggles to be around her friends. She later admits to Chris that she blames herself for the accident, but he states that it was not her fault. Months later, Chris suffers flashbacks to the crash, causing him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is struggling to get back behind the wheel.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E

[...] In an interview with film critic Christopher Hicks, Boam said that the success of the movie is generally credited to Cronenberg, and that King wouldn't give Boam credit for writing a good script. He said, [...] "It's hard for him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> not the one who could crack that book. But I think that movie holds together as a real movie.

500|$|Oliver's career further {{deteriorated}} {{in early}} 2011, when it transpired {{he was not}} a qualified doctor. A series of setbacks – failing the exam to progress on to his CT1 training, blaming a surgical error on Penny, and the death of a patient in his care – prompted him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> swapped his own exam paper with Penny's in his final year of medical school. Anderson explained that Oliver could no longer cope with the mounting pressure, hence his confession. Contrasting the siblings, he assessed [...] " [...] was seen as the golden boy when he arrived at Holby – but he was trading on his sister's success." [...] Issued with the ultimatum of confessing to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen, Oliver realised that [...] "he must take responsibility", lest he [...] "lose the one person who loves him unconditionally." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver was {{initially}} portrayed as [...] "the golden boy" [...] compared to his sister. Boyishly charming and medically talented, he nonetheless lacked {{confidence in his}} ability. When Oliver reached his F2 training, the series formed an on-screen duo by pairing him with registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). Oliver's lack of competency was highlighted – he endangered patients and landed his colleagues in trouble. In a prominent storyline, Oliver {{made a series of}} medical errors, which forced him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> cheated on an exam at medical school. He began a downward spiral, and reached [...] "rock bottom" [...] when Penny was killed off. He was then central to a special flashback episode, which depicted his battle to cope with her death. Though he confessed to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that he was not truly qualified, Hanssen allowed Oliver to continue practising medicine.|$|E
500|$|The local show [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] digs up an old {{video of}} Leslie {{shaking hands with}} Dexhart and overanalyzes {{every aspect of the}} short clip. Ann brings Dexhart to her home, where Ann and Leslie demand he clear Leslie's name. Dexhart refuses because the fake scandal is so docile {{compared}} to his real transgressions that it is actually positive press for him. Soon after, Ann is horrified to discover that a news crew secretly followed Dexhart to her home and took a photograph of the meeting, resulting in speculation that Ann is Leslie's lesbian lover in a three-way relationship with Dexhart. A furious Leslie schedules an appearance on [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] to clear her name once and for all. On the show, host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) surprises Leslie by bringing out Dexhart, who tries to prove their affair by claiming that Leslie has a mole on her buttocks. To finally end the scandal, Leslie pulls down her pants on live television and moons Callamezzo. Since there is no mole, Dexhart is forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fabricated the sex scandal.|$|E

Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening.

500|$|Garrow also {{influenced}} {{the rules of}} evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the best evidence rule. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge {{to insist that the}} advocates have independence in submitting it. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the Old Bailey, the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority. While this increased {{towards the end of the}} 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts, Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross-examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's medical expert <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not prove how Delew had died. Garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively [...] "interrogate" [...] such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).|$|E
500|$|Conant {{returned}} to the United States in February 1957, and moved to an apartment on the Upper East Side of New York. Between 1957 and 1965, the Carnegie Corporation of New York gave him {{over a million dollars}} to write studies of education. [...] In 1959 he published The American High School Today. This became a best seller, resulting in Conant's appearance on the cover of Time magazine on September 14, 1959. In it, Conant called for a number of reforms, including the consolidation of high schools into larger bodies that could offer a broader range of curriculum choices. Although it was slammed by critics of the American system, who hoped for a system of education based on the European model, it did lead to a wave of reforms across the country. His subsequent Slums and Suburbs in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding busing as impractical, Conant urged Americans [...] "to accept de facto segregated schools". This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been wrong. In The Education of American Teachers in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by which teachers were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.|$|E
500|$|Representing [...] "the {{exemplary}} {{good wife}} and mother", Clair {{is depicted as}} both composed and maternal.

US Weekly said that the character possesses a [...] "sly" [...] sense of humor. A proficient debater who always speaks her mind, she rarely loses arguments. Writing for For Harriet, Tracey Michae'l described the character as [...] "elegantly tough, eloquent, and engaging". Usually depicted as the smartest character in any given room, Clair often uses her skills attained as a lawyer to uncover the truth when other characters, particularly her children, are lying, on one occasion getting Theo <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had teased an overweight fast food restaurant employee. Robert E. Johnson of Ebony observed that Clair's legal background [...] "equipped her with rapid, razor-sharp retorts to counter" [...] Cliff's humor. Clair is also shown to be a talented singer – she performs a duet with musician Stevie Wonder in the episode [...] "A Touch of Wonder" [...] – dancer and multilinguist, capable of speaking Spanish and Portuguese in addition to English. Passionate about her African American heritage and culture, Clair wins painter Ellis Wilson's – her [...] "great uncle" [...] in the series – original painting Funeral Procession at an auction, which she purchases for $11, 000 and proudly hangs in her living room {{for the remainder of the}} series.|$|E
