500|$|From {{the third}} season {{to the sixth}} season, the mysterious Syndicate was {{explored}} in detail. In the two part episode [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology {{in a new direction}} was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated [...] "I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore." ...|$|E

[...] The original script featured various flashback sequences to the actors Peter Donat, William B. Davis and Veronica Cartwright, all from scenes around twenty-to-thirty years earlier in the show. They did various makeup jobs on the actors to make them look younger. However, the writers eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it [...] "just didn't [...] work", so they cut out most of that storyline, which ultimately led to the creation of a whole new direction in which the Cigarette Smoking Man provided a monologue explaining the history of the project instead. The first scene was shot in Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|The 350th {{anniversary of}} Monteverdi's death, celebrated in 1993, brought a further wave of {{interest}} in his works, and since that time performances of L'incoronazione have been given in opera houses and music festivals all over the world. In April 1994 the Juilliard School in New York presented a version based on Curtis's edition, with an orchestra that mixed baroque and modern elements. The New York Times's Allen Kozinn wrote that this production had done well to resolve daunting problems arising from Monteverdi's having left instrumentation and scoring details open, and from the numerous competing versions of the score. In 2000 the work was chosen by Opéra de Montréal as the company's first venture into baroque opera, with a performance directed by Renaud Doucet. Opera Canada reported that Doucet had found [...] "a perfect rhetoric for a modern crowd, creating an atmosphere of moral ambivalence that the courtiers of Monteverdi's day would have taken for granted." [...] Less successful, in the critics' eyes, was the innovative English National Opera (ENO) production directed by Chen Shi-Zheng in October 2007. According to The London Evening Standard critic Fiona Maddocks the cast was strong, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to be playing in the wrong roles. For unexplained reasons much of the action took place underwater; at one point [...] "a snorkeller flip-flops across the stage in a harness." [...] Seneca [...] "wore green Wellington boots and pushed a lawnmower". At the end of 2007, in his opera review of the year, The Daily Telegraph's Rupert Christiansen compared ENO's production unfavourably with a punk musical version of the opera that had been staged during that year's Edinburgh Festival.|$|E

2500|$|Sharon {{wrote in}} his autobiography: [...] "We had become skilled at finding our way in the darkest nights and {{gradually}} we built up the strength and endurance these kind of operations required. Under the stress of constant combat we drew closer {{to one another and}} began to operate not just as a military unit but almost as a family. ... e were in combat almost every day. Ambushes and battles followed each other until <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to run together." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that there was considerable competition within the coalition. [...] "There were many more people with aspirations than space to accommodate them, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> ready to jump ship when they felt they were being excluded" [...] said Janet Kelly, a Veneuelan political commentator. Columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas newspaper El Nuevo Pais joined several government officials when she later suggested that during Carmona's tenure, Isaac Perez Recao, {{a member of a}} family that owned a controlling stake in a firm called Venoco, a subsidiary of which Carmona ran, had allegedly been a key financier of the coup and had been pulling strings behind the scenes. [...] "He immediately surrounded himself with people who invoked fear in Venezuela" [...] complained one official about Cormona. [...] "Obviously, this coup was very poorly coordinated. It caught the democratic opposition by surprise." [...] The Miami Herald reported that [...] "moderate politicians complained that Carmona, a centrist businessman, had been 'hijacked' by rightists." ...|$|E

40|$|Scholars and pundits alike {{have been}} {{qualifying}} our times as of “transition and turbulence”, “disorder” and “strategic unease”.

60|$|Captain Benwick {{was most}} considerately {{attentive}} to her; and, united as <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even {{in thinking that}} it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.|$|E

50|$|Themes recur {{throughout}} the work, {{and although it}} is 13 separate songs, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> to flow together.
