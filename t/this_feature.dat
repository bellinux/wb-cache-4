5|$|According to Roger Hector, vice {{president}} and general manager of Sega Technical Institute, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of Sonic & Knuckles, between the releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Early development screenshots suggest Knuckles was planned to be playable in the first Sonic the Hedgehog via Sonic & Knuckles lock-on technology, but <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> was removed prior to release.|$|E
5|$|All GameCube {{systems support}} {{the display of}} {{stereoscopic}} 3D, and Luigi's Mansion was developed to utilize <b>this</b> <b>feature.</b> However, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was never enabled outside of development.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E

5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a report}} by George Ivatt in 1945, smoke {{deflectors}} were introduced due to drifting smoke obscuring the crew's forward vision. The first locomotive to be fitted with smoke deflectors from the outset was No. 6253 City of St. Albans in September 1946. All the following four locomotives included <b>this</b> <b>feature.</b> The first unstreamlined locomotive to be retrofitted was No. 6232 Duchess of Montrose in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E

5|$|In June 2014, RatPac Entertainment and Class 5 Films {{acquired}} the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Burnham, Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotamuses into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them. The movie will highlight the Burnham - Duquesne rivalry. Edward Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner will produce <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> film.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the spinal cord is performed to distinguish between Guillain–Barré syndrome and other conditions causing limb weakness, such as spinal cord compression. If an MRI scan shows enhancement of the nerve roots, this may be indicative of GBS. In children, <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> is present in 95% of scans, {{but it is not}} specific to Guillain–Barré syndrome, so other confirmation is also needed.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. <b>This</b> <b>feature</b> could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Python uses {{whitespace}} indentation {{to delimit}} blocks – rather than curly braces or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; {{a decrease in}} indentation signifies {{the end of the}} current block. <b>This</b> <b>feature</b> is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see <b>this</b> <b>feature</b> until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to <b>this</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|E
