5|$|During 14 November {{infantry}} in the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions concentrated and reorganised their ranks. The advance {{was taken}} over by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which crossed the railway north of Junction Station and the Anzac Mounted Division which pressed <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Ottoman Army northwards near the coast.|$|E
5|$|In these {{extremely}} tough conditions, the British infantry {{were unable}} to move effectively against <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> German and Turkish force in the following days. Alone, the Anzac Mounted Division was unable to stop <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> force withdrawing to Katia and eventually back to their base at Bir el Abd. This base was abandoned the day after it was attacked by the Anzac Mounted Division, on 12 August 1916, ending any threat to the Suez Canal {{for the remainder of}} the war. The battle cost the Allies 1,202 casualties of which 222 were killed, 71 died of wounds and 909 were wounded; half of these were Australians.|$|E

The architectural pattern and the natural beauty of the place have made <b>The</b> <b>Retreat</b> a tourist attraction in Shimla.|$|R
50|$|The first {{project of}} MASGD was an LGBT Muslim <b>Retreat.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>Retreat</b> {{was held in}} 2011, {{under the auspices of}} the Queer Muslim Working Group. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>Retreat</b> has been held each May. In 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Retreat</b> welcomed a total of 85 adults, {{including}} both LGBTQ Muslims and their partners.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>retreat</b> is {{accessed}} by Chemin de Lac Meech with a gatehouse, staffed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, at {{the driveway of}} <b>the</b> <b>retreat.</b> <b>The</b> Prime Minister's motorcade accesses Harrington Lake from Ottawa via Quebec Autoroute 5.|$|R
5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. <b>The</b> <b>retreating</b> forces {{had no choice but to}} use a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also {{carrying}} a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored vehicles in his operational reserve against <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> forces, fearing a possible cut-off from the rest of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of the Negev Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the retreat.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Rijeka was {{targeted}} by around 30 Allied bombing raids, and in 1945 <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Germans damaged approximately 90% {{of the port}} facilities. Among the ships sunk in the port was the German auxiliary cruiser Kiebitz, which would later be raised and repaired to become the Yugoslav Navy Yacht Galeb. The city of Rijeka purchased the ship, which was subsequently moored in the port and eventually opened as a museum in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{other six}} {{companies}} went under Major Stone. During <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> from Richmond, they lost {{company in a}} swamp, then fought at Gaines Mill. Two other companies were lost during <b>the</b> <b>retreat.</b> At <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> to Harrison's Landing, Stone and his men constructed a bridge over a stream, possibly saving the Union army. Stone took command of a different regiment after this.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Retreat</b> {{consists}} of talks, discussions, reflections, prayer and celebrations of the Sacraments of Penance and Eucharist. Though <b>the</b> <b>Retreat</b> is offered from a Catholic perspective, non-Catholics {{are welcome to}} attend.|$|R
50|$|The team is {{composed}} of student leaders who have already been on <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> and a few faculty from the school.

5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|Hu did not {{witness the}} worst atrocities of the war, {{such as the}} Nanjing Massacre, but she was present when <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> KMT {{soldiers}} burned down the city of Changsha. In her reports she wrote about the numerous dead and dying soldiers and civilians she had encountered, and her corps was frequently attacked by Japanese bombing raids.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} {{operation}} was over, Khalid and his mobile guard moved north to pursue <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Byzantine soldiers; {{he found them}} near Damascus and attacked. In the ensuing fight Vahan, who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmouk, was killed. Khalid then entered Damascus where he {{was said to have}} been welcomed by the local residents, thus recapturing the city.|$|E

50|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> of <b>the</b> Numidians, <b>the</b> <b>retreat</b> was well-timed by the quick-thinking Jugurtha. As a result, Jugurtha's forces {{suffered}} light casualties {{compared to}} the battered Romans. Therefore, the result was somewhat indecisive.|$|R

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground and keep <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Chinese forces {{from being able to}} rest.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April the squadrons {{were issued}} Hotchkiss machine-guns, one per troop. After the British withdrawal, the Turks built a {{defensive}} line of trenches and redoubts, {{from the sea}} south of Gaza to Beersheba, following {{the route of the}} road. The British plan for the second attack involved the ANZAC Mounted Division providing flank protection, intercepting any reinforcements, and pursuing <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Turkish forces if required.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. <b>The</b> <b>retreating</b> Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend {{their side of the}} river and, thus, effectively ended any attempts to gain control of the Mississippi River during the war.|$|E

40|$|A deep {{psychological}} {{desire for}} “retreat” has been articulated {{in a variety}} of built and imagined, shared and individual, spatial dimensions. To develop a spatially thematized understanding and definition of “retreat” landscapes, five individual scenarios were chosen for examination.

5|$|Sherman {{captured}} {{the state capital}} of Columbia, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a deliberate act of vengeance, and still others that <b>the</b> <b>retreating</b> Confederates burned bales of cotton {{on their way out}} of town.|$|E
5|$|Skirmishes on the {{frontier}} between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire first occurred in 1050.
