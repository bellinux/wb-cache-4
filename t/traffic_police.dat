Of those ten mechanisms, six (two static and four activity-based ones) were shown in [26] to provide the best <b>traffic</b> <b>policing</b> results. These were: (a) the token bucket (TB) mechanism, (b) the jumping window (JW) mechanism, (c) the variable exponentially weighted moving average (V-EWMA) mechanism, (d) the hybrid V-EWMA token bucket (VEWMA-TB), (e) the frame size aware token bucket (FSA-TB), (f) the GOP modeling based jumping window (GMB-JW).|$|R

5|$|The {{administration}} {{office for}} the construction was established in 1923 and was until 1935 located at Voss. In that period, construction was led by Peter Bernhard Kristian Lahlum, who was also responsible for the Hardanger Line. After the Hardanger Line was completed, Lahlum retired, and the office was moved to Flåm where responsibility {{was taken over by}} Adolph M. B. Kielland. To start with, there were 120 men working on the construction, although this quickly increased to 220. The numbers fluctuated between that and as low as 80, although hit an all-time high of 280 people in 1937. To house the employees, eight barracks were built. Among the first things built were housing and station buildings, which could then be used by people working on the construction. The local economy was stimulated by farmers being paid for transport. Using horses, they would transport tourists by day and building materials by night. The competition was fierce, resulting in fights for customers, although it calmed down after <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> were introduced.|$|E

In traffic shaping, packets are delayed until they conform. <b>Traffic</b> <b>policing</b> and <b>traffic</b> shaping are commonly used to protect the network against excess or excessively bursty traffic, see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions being discarded by traffic management functions in the network.|$|R

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>policing</b> {{is about}} {{changing}} driver behaviour through guiding, enforcing and promoting safe road use within the road transport system. Typically, {{when we think}} of <b>traffic</b> <b>policing,</b> we think of enforcement alone : the detection, the ticketing, and the penalties. But <b>traffic</b> <b>policing</b> has traditionally been much more than that, partly as a consequence of not having technologies and methods to effectively enforce illegal driver behaviour. Prior to the 1980 s and 1990 s, interventions with erring drivers were mostly unplanned and arose from observations of an illegal act. Police intervened in person, which allowed for discussion about the illegal behaviour, its causes and consequences, and corrective actions to avoid re- offending. Since then, the availability of enforcement technologies and procedures targeting drink driving, drug driving and speed detection have seen a predominant focus on detection and punishment of drivers on a community-wide basis. As a consequence, <b>traffic</b> <b>policing</b> strategies became less focused on individual guidance and safety promotion. The safe system approach provides perhaps the strongest direction for several decades in highlighting that guiding, enforcing and promoting safe driver behaviour comprise three core taskings for effective <b>traffic</b> <b>policing.</b> Examples from Australian, New Zealand and overseas projects will be presented to illustrate the application of safe system principles to meet <b>traffic</b> <b>policing</b> challenges in guidance and promotion of safer individual behaviour. 10 page(s...|$|R
