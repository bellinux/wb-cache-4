40|$|Earthen dams are {{constructed}} to store {{water for the}} purposes of human consumption, food production, electricity production, industrial use and flood protection. Failure of Earthen dams may be due to hydraulic failure, structural failure or seepage failure. Hydraulic failure may be due to overtopping, erosion of the upstream/downstream surface/toe and piping. Structural failures can occur in either the embankment or the appurtenances. Failure of a spillway, lake drain, or other appurtenance may lead to failure of the embankment. Cracking, settlement, and slides are the more common signs of structural failure of embankments. Seepage Failure occurs due to the uncontrolled seepage in both velocity and quantity. Water permeating slowly through the dam and progressively erode the soil in the embankment or the foundation toward the reservoir. Eventually with increased seepage flow rate the direct connection is made to the reservoir causing the piping. Piping may occur through the dam or the foundation causing dam failure. Seepage problems in large dams should be addressed in proper way on time to prevent before it becomes a massive disaster. Field investigation and data evaluation reveal the type of seepage and its extent. Then the most appropriate remedial measures can be adopted. Construction of <b>toe</b> <b>filter,</b> toe drain, downstream seepage berm, conducting cement/clay grouting and Cutoff walls construction are more frequently practiced to prevent seepage through and beneath the dam. Cutoff walls make the seepage paths longer, decrease the exit gradient at the toe and reduce the seepage quantities. Compacted impervious trench cutoffs, concrete cutoff walls, sheet piles, slurry trenches/cutoff walls are some different types of cutoff walls currently being utilized...|$|E
40|$|In India, due to {{progressively}} {{increase in}} number and capacity of coal based thermal power plant huge amount of fly ash is generated. In current scenario only 40 - 50 % fly ash are used and rest of the fly ash is disposed of and restored in ash pond with dyke to reduce the land wastage. The failure rate of ash dykes are much {{higher than that of}} dams because seepage analysis is not taken into account while design of the former. So, construction of safe ash dyke becomes a top priority for engineers as its occasional failure creates havoc in safety of surrounding people. It causes economic losses as well as environmental and water pollution which is dangerous for both human and aquatic life. There is no well-defined design procedure and codal provision for design and maintenance of fly ash dam in India. This project describes about the design of ash dyke in various stages constructed in various methods with the help of finite element package PLAXIS considering various parameters representing varied environmental conditions. A laboratory model has been developed and it is found that the phreatic line is fairly matching with our numerical analysis result. Due to limited time, practical model variation could but made but numerical analysis are made for different heights of water at top of fill side, different rates of rapid drawdown, providing different width of vertical sand drains. The steady seepage analysis is done using PLAXFLOW module of PLAXIS and it is found that factor of safety is less compared to that of dry condition. Based on laboratory investigation it was observed that fly ash is dispersible. Further phreatic line does not remain within body of dyke when sand drains and <b>toe</b> <b>filters</b> are not provided, which may lead to its leakage. Then by using vertical sand filters of varying widths, dykes are analyzed and the one having minimum deformation is chosen...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} some {{results of a}} new procedure, developed by MEDUS, to analyze the hydrodynamic aspects of the interactions between maritime emerged breakwaters and waves, by integrating CAD and CFD software. The filtration of the fluid within the interstices of a concrete blocks breakwater is evaluated by integrating the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) inside the voids rather than making use of the widespread “porous media” approach. The structure is thus modelled, very much like {{in the real world}} or in the physical laboratory testing, by overlapping individual three-dimensional elements (Armour in Accropode™, Core-loc™ or Xbloc ®, <b>toe</b> protection and <b>filter</b> layer in stones), and then the computational grid is fitted so as to provide enough computational nodes within the flow paths. This approach is meant to match closely the physical laboratory test procedure, and it is oriented at analyzing the hydrodynamic aspects of the phenomenon (overtopping, breaking, Run-up, reflection) as well as the stability of armour elements. Therefore, for the results' validation, the numerical Run-up and reflection effects on virtual breakwater were compared with some empirical formulas and some similar laboratory tests...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the beach erosion {{problem at the}} Village of Mayabeque, located 60 km south of Havana at the South coast of Cuba will be investigated. Mayabeque is a small local holiday village. 20 houses are {{permanently}} inhabited and in the summer the population goes up to 3000, mostly Cuban people all spending there holidays here. Mayabeque suffers from an average coast regression of 1. 1 meter per year. The main objective of this project is the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque Beach. Therefore an investigation to the causes of erosion {{needs to be made}} and after that solutions will be proposed. The first step in the research was gathering relevant information. Information on bathymetry, wind, waves etc. was collected. Furthermore the influence of nearby rivers, the neighbouring mangrove coasts and the Coral reefs in the gulf of Batabano has been investigated. With all this data a qualitative analyses was made to identify the probable causes of erosion. The following circumstances were identified as possible causes of erosion: An increase in the frequency and intensity of storms (thus an increase of offshore transport), global sea level rise, a dominant long shore transport and the construction of houses on the dune. All these possible causes have been integrated in a complete erosion theory. The principal idea is that sand from the beach and dune is transported to the foreshore and then moved out of the area by long shore transport. Both long shore and cross-shore transport have been calculated, using the CERC formula and Unibest CL+ for long shore transport and the convolution method and Sbeach in combination with BMAP for cross-shore transport. It appeared to be difficult to combine the results from both gradients in order to simulate the history of erosion. Mainly qualitative insights were gained. The results though do prove that the developed theory is a good description of the history of erosion at Mayabeque Beach. With this theory in mind three concepts are presented for the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque beach. These concepts are: nourishment, nourishment with groins and nourishment with offshore breakwaters. Every concept contains several alternatives. With the help of a Multi Criteria Analysis one alternative from every concept was chosen to be designed. These alternatives are: Beach nourishment, groin field with nourishment and multiple offshore breakwaters in combination with nourishment. After designing these alternatives a multi criteria analysis was performed again and {{it was found that the}} groin field with nourishment was the best solution. After an optimization a cost reduction of 30 % was achieved and this alternative ultimately arrived to the following dimensions: The groin field exists of four groins with a distance of 500 m between them and with a length of 133 meters each, with a crest height of 1, 5 meter above mean sea level and a crest width of 5, 04 meter. Each groin has an armour layer, filter layer and care. At both sides at the <b>toe</b> a <b>filter</b> is placed. The armour layer exist of quarry stone with a Dn 50 of 0, 63 m, the filter layer of armour stone with a Dn 50 of 0, 32 m and the core exists of quarry run with a Dn 50 of 0, 16 m. The <b>filters</b> at the <b>toe</b> are made up of three layers. Each layer has a width of 20 cm. In downward direction these layers have a Dn 50 of respectively 108 mm, 18 mm and 3 mm. The slope of the groin is 1 : 1 and of the head 1 : 23. The average width of the beach nourishment is 30. 2 meter with a total volume of 428800 m 3. The construction of the whole alternative will claim about 24 weeks and the costs of this project are calculated at 1. 4 million dollar. Due to the groin field with nourishment the beach will be stable and after a storm accretion will return to equilibrium situation. Erosion is present at the down drift side (at the mangroves) of the groin in the west but due to the initial placement of the nourishment in the form of the equilibrium profile the erosion will be less. It is realized this solution still is expensive and that it will take time for Melena del Sur to raise funds. Therefore a cheap initial solution is presented, which can be used to cover the time until sufficient funds for the definitive solution have been found. This cheap initial solution involves a redistribution of the available stones presently situated in seawalls and groins in an orderly sequence of berm breakwaters.
