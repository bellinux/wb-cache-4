Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute. The agreement <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> relative positions of the archipelagos, rather than being based simply on northward extension of the continental border of Norway and Russia.|$|E

5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values {{higher than those of}} primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome soft {{magnetic}} materials are strongly dependent of the temperature, because of their low Curie temperature. In order to predict their behavior in electrical devices, engineers need hysteresis models able to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> temperature.

5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 {{of the mass of}} Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E

The inputs {{of the map}} are modelled in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> information and the correlation of the patterns contained in the sequences. The first approaches represent the input of the map by a representative vector or by a covariance matrix in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> correlations between the sequence components. These approaches do not <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> temporal order in the sequences (the dynamics). The other approaches introduce the dynamics in the covariance matrix. When covariance matrices represent sequences, the SOM is modified in order to <b>take</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> fact that the inputs are matrices. The experimentations show that our approaches are better than some other temporal self organizing maps for user Web navigation classification...|$|R
5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>the</b> wind speed and direction during each jump, {{as well as}} mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions {{at the time of}} a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E
