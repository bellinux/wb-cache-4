5|$|Remote afterloading systems provide {{protection}} from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes.

40|$|Introduction: Breast conserving {{radiotherapy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common procedures performed in any radiation oncology department. A tangential parallel-opposed pair is usually used for this purpose. This technique is performed using 2 D or 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> systems. The aim of this study was to compare 2 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> with 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> in tangential irradiation in breast conserving radiotherapy. In this comparison, homogeneity of isodoses in the breast volume and lung dose were considered. Material and Methods: Twenty patients with breast cancer treated with conservative surgery were included in this study. The patients were CT scanned. Two-dimensional <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> with the Alfard 2 D TPS was performed for each patient using a single central CT slice. The data used on the Alfard 2 D TPS was imported into the Eclipse 3 D TPS, on which 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> was performed. Cobalt- 60 beams were used in all plans. Results: Comparing 2 D and 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning,</b> homogeneity of isodoses was improved in 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> (p 30 Gy was increased in 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> (p< 0. 01). Discussion and Conclusion: 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> is a more suitable option for patients with breast cancer treated with conservative surgery because of improved dose homogeneity in 3 D <b>treatment</b> <b>planning.</b> The results of the treatment can be improved with reduced recurrence probability and skin problems...|$|R

5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any <b>treatment</b> <b>plan,</b> and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized <b>treatment</b> <b>plan.</b> The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E

She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter {{in case the}} baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a <b>treatment</b> <b>plan,</b> led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.|$|E
5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year field trial. The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some even over 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 percent rate of abscess at the injection site, which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly <b>treatment</b> <b>plan</b> until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E

40|$|Objective <b>Treatment</b> <b>planning,</b> an {{essential}} component of clinical practice, has received little attention in the dental literature and {{there appears to be no}} consistent format being followed in the teaching and development of <b>treatment</b> <b>plans</b> within dental school curricula. No investigation, to our knowledge, has been carried out to explore the subject of <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> since the advent of electronic health record (EHR) use in dentistry. It is therefore important to examine the topic of <b>treatment</b> <b>planning</b> in the context of EHRs. Methods This paper reports on how 25 predoctoral dental students from two U.

Three calibrated clinical teaching faculty scored diagnosis entry, diagnosis-treatment (procedure) pairing, and sequencing of treatment according to criteria taught in their curriculum. Scores were then converted to percent correct and reported as means (with standard deviations). Results Overall, the participants earned 48. 2 % of the possible points. Participants at School 2 earned a mean of 54. 3 % compared with participants at School 1, who earned 41. 9 %. Students fared better selecting the appropriate treatment (59. 8 %) compared with choosing the correct diagnoses (41. 9 %) but performed least favorably when organizing the sequence of their <b>treatment</b> <b>plans</b> (41. 7 %).

For dose distribution in water with the presence of the ovoid, the MCNPX result agrees with the measurement.
