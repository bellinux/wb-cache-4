5|$|Akira is an effeminate {{male with}} a crush Nanako Momoi. After exchanging bodies with her, his {{personality}} and Nanako's feminine appearance causes his popularity <b>to</b> <b>soar.</b> His best friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, learns his secret and becomes enamored {{with his new}} appearance. Initially, Akira was adamant on returning to his body and maintaining his masculinity. During the series, he reluctantly reconciles Shinnosuke's feelings and upon realizing everyone is happier with the new statusquo, resigns to live in Nanako's body. He is voiced by Kenji Nojima in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Shun Shioya in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{prevailing}} sea-breezes and long north-south ridge, Point Loma was a well-known gliding site during 1929-1935. William Hawley Bowlus the Superintendent of Construction on the Spirit of St. Louis and resident of Point Loma built the first American sailplane the Bowlus SP-1 and flew that aircraft along {{the west side of}} Point Loma to establish new American endurance records. Bowlus later used other refined designs <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> for over 9 hours near the Cabrillo National Monument, and one of Bowlus' students Jack C. Barstow soared over Point Loma for over 15 hours in 1930 to establish an unofficial world record for soaring endurance.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{football}} career continued <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> {{as several}} Victorian Football League clubs sought to recruit Laurie and Robert Junior. South Melbourne, partly through its connection to Roy Cazaly and partly through its offer to Nash of an unprecedented £3 per match, accommodation {{and a job}} in a sports store, eventually won the battle for the Nash brothers' signatures for the 1933 VFL season. Such was the interest in Melbourne in where Nash would play, when South Melbourne committee member Joe Scanlan travelled to Tasmania to sign Nash, he was smuggled aboard the steamer to avoid media attention.|$|E

5|$|Federalist state legislatures, {{primarily}} those {{north of}} the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt {{a second set of}} resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives {{at the outset of the}} 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This allows them <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts {{they are able}} to spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|Richard is {{the prince}} of Windor who befriends Asbel and Sophie after his visit to Lhant. Before meeting Asbel, Richard has a strong {{distrust}} in others due to others using his status for their own gain and his uncle Cedric's attempts to murder him. When Cedric poisoned and left him {{to die in the}} underground passage, Lambda saves his life by fusing with him. Seven years later, Lambda's influence causes Richard to become violent and urges him to destroy humanity by fusing with the Lastalia. After separating from Lambda, Richard is determined to atone for his crimes which causes his popularity <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> in all three countries. He is voiced by Yuko Sanpei as a child and Daisuke Namikawa as an adult. In the English dub, he is voiced by Wendee Lee as a child and David Vincent as an adult. Since his debut, Richard has ranked on the Tales character popularity polls.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no doubt}} that it is on the work of tools {{directed}} by brains that the future of Australia depends more than anything else. With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us...|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals <b>to</b> <b>soar</b> in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|It {{had taken}} {{a decade and a}} half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue <b>to</b> <b>soar.</b> With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern by the end of 1980.|$|E

5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal {{columns of}} rising hot air {{to enable them}} <b>to</b> <b>soar.</b> These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through {{areas such as the}} Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|E
