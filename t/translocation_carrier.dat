5000|$|Reciprocal translocations {{are usually}} an {{exchange}} of material between nonhomologous chromosomes. Estimates of incidence range from about 1 in 500 [...] to 1 in 625 human newborns. Such translocations are usually harmless and may be found through prenatal diagnosis. However, carriers of balanced reciprocal translocations have increased risks of creating gametes with unbalanced chromosome translocations, leading to miscarriages or children with abnormalities. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are often offered to families that may carry a translocation. Most balanced translocation carriers are healthy {{and do not have}} any symptoms, but about 6% of them have a range of symptoms that may include autism, intellectual disability, or congenital anomalies.

40|$|BACKGROUND Ovarian {{response}} in female <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> {{is not well}} understood. We aimed to evaluate the impact of chromosomal autosomal balanced translocations on the ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in female carriers undergoing IVF and PGD. METHODS In a retrospective study, we included all female <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> who underwent PGD at our centre. We compared these patients to female patients from couples with male <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> who underwent PGD. RESULTS Results from 79 cycles of PGD from 33 female <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> were compared with 116 cycles from 55 male <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers.</b> No difference was observed for patient characteristics: female age, anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone or antral follicle count. No difference in COS parameters was observed for the total dose of recombinant FSH, the number of retrieved oocytes and embryos on Day 3, for unaffected and transferred embryos. For the two groups, pregnancy rate was similar per cycle (12. 7 versus 20. 7 %, P = 0. 208). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that female <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> had a significantly higher estradiol level {{on the day of}} hCG administration (+ 540 pg/ml, P = 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS This paper is the largest to report ovarian response of female <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers.</b> This study showed that the ovarian response to COS was not impaired by balanced translocation status, suggesting that female chromosomal structural abnormalities did not influence the results of COS in PGD. Thus, female <b>carriers</b> of balanced <b>translocations</b> could be considered normal responders and standard doses of gonadotrophins used for ovarian stimulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of the Robertonian (ROB) translocation in newborn babies is approximately one in 1000. Robertsonian translocation is an unusual type of chromosome rearrangement caused by two particular chromosomes joining together. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze the segregation of the ROB translocations in 13 male carriers, and to verify a possible inter-chromosomal effect (ICE) of the ROB translocation on chromosomes 18, X, and Y. Thirteen male patients were included in the study. Multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to analyze chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 18, X and Y in sperm. Among the heterozygous ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers,</b> the {{frequency of}} normal/balanced spermatozoa resulting from alternate segregation varied between 70. 4 and 85. 2 %. The frequency of unbalanced spermatozoa resulting from adjacent segregation varied between 14. 8 and 29. 6 %. Increased frequencies of aneuploidy for a sex chromosome were found in 10 ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> (P 2 -P 8, P 10 -P 12). Increased frequencies of aneuploidy for chromosome 18 were found in 10 ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> (P 3 -P 9, P 11 -P 13). In addition, increased frequencies of diploid were found in 11 ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> (P 2 -P 9, P 11 -P 13). Among the homozygous ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers,</b> the rate of balanced spermatozoa was 99. 7 % and the frequency of unbalanced spermatozoa was 0. 3 %. However, the frequencies of aneuploidy for a sex chromosome and chromosome 18 were normal. Despite the high number of normal/balanced frequencies, there remained many unbalanced spermatozoa resulting from alternate segregation. The ROB <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> may be at an increased risk for ICE. Robertsonian translocation homozygosity could be seen as a potential speciation in humans with 44 chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{demonstrate}} that <b>translocation</b> <b>carrier</b> patients {{can be identified}} by analysis of chromosomes in preimplan-tation human embryos. Methods A report of 3 cases in which multiple embryos were found to possess consistent segmental imbalances by CCS. The parents then had a conventional karyotype performed. Results In each case, parental karyotyping revealed the pres-ence of an otherwise unknown balanced translocation. Origi-nal blastocyst CCS results were then reinterpreted to consider the presence of unbalanced derivative chromosomes and to modify the diagnosis of embryos eligible for transfer. Conclusions It is possible to identify patients that are car-riers of balanced translocations through the analysis of chro-mosomes in their IVF-derived embryos. Given that <b>translocation</b> <b>carrier</b> screening is not routinely performed, the growing use of CCS may facilitate discovery and pro-vide both an etiology of reproductive failure and an im-proved more focused treatment strategy going forward.

40|$|<b>Translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> have an {{increased}} risk of miscarriage or {{the birth of a child}} with congenital anomalies. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is performed in <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> to select for balanced embryos and, thus, increase the chance of an ongoing pregnancy. However, a common experience is that reciprocal <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> produce a high percentage of unbalanced embryos, which cannot be transferred. Therefore, the pregnancy rates in PGD in this patient group are low. In a cohort of 85 reciprocal <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> undergoing PGD we have searched for cytogenetic characteristics of the translocations that can predict the percentage of balanced embryos. Using shape algorithms, the most likely segregation mode per translocation was determined. Shape algorithm, breakpoint location, and relative chromosome segment sizes proved not to be independent predictors of the percentage of balanced embryos. The ratio of the relative sizes of the translocated segments of both translocation chromosomes can give some insight into the chance of transferable embryos: Very asymmetrical translocations have a higher risk of unbalanced products (p = 0. 048). Counseling of the couples on the pros and cons of all their reproductive options remains very important...|$|R

Additions of nucleotides, deletions, duplications, and a triplication identified at the breakpoints demonstrate high complexity at the breakpoint junctions and indicate involvement of multiple mechanisms in the DNA breakage and repair process during translocation formation. Possible detailed nonhomologous end-joining scenarios for t(1; 22) cases are presented.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the chromosomal abberations and their incidence in non-consanguineous couples with a history of two or more than two spontaneous abortion. In the study, we carried out cytogenetic analysis on 434 couples.

Peripheral blood were taken from patients, then performed with lymphocyte culture and stained by binded using Giemsa-banding method. For each individual, 20 - 30 -cells chromosomes were counted and around 5 - 10 well-binded metaphase chromosomes were karyotyped for numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations. Of 434 couples investigated, 30 (6. 91 %) were found to have chromosomal abnormality, in one of couples partners. In 13 of couples (2. 99 %), one of partners was found to be balanced <b>translocation</b> <b>carrier.</b> Of these, 7 (1. 61 %) were found to be reciprocal carrier, while 6 (1. 38 %) Robertsonian-type balanced <b>translocation</b> <b>carrier.</b> Gonadal mosaicism was found in 3 couples (0. 69 %), pericentric 9 inversion in 8 couples (1. 85 %), while 6 couples showed different chromosomal structure from each other.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Male mice, {{heterozygous}} for two semi-identical reciprocal translocations T(1; 13) 70 H and T(1; 13) 1 Wa {{are usually}} sterile. We have investigated this oligoasthenoteratozoospermic mouse model using ICSI. METHODS: B 6 D 2 F 1 oocytes were injected with epididymal or testicular sperm from fertile or sterile <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> and from chromosomally normal fertile controls. ICSI efficiency {{was determined by}} pronucleus formation and first cleavage rates. For arrested zygotes, cell cycle progression was evaluated by BrdU incorporation and incubation with okadaic acid. RESULTS: Epididymal sperm from infertile <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> showed a slightly lower fertilization rate (70 % vs. 92 %, 95 % and 95 % for fertile <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> and two groups of normal fertile control males, respectively) and a severely reduced cleavage rate (33 % vs. 87 %, 96 % and 89 % for the same control groups). However, the use of testicular sperm significantly improved the cleavage rate (62 % vs. 83 % for normal fertile controls). Development of arrested zygotes was delayed or blocked during S- and G 2 -phase. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas control testicular and epididymal sperm performed equally well, the use of testicular sperm from oligospermic T/T' males significantly increased first cleavage rates {{when compared to the}} low rates with epididymal sperm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human male <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> {{may present}} {{alterations}} in the meiotic process {{due to the}} presence of the translocated chromosomes. The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms that affect meiotic segregation in <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> by analysing different stages of the meiotic process. METHODS: Meiotic studies using fluorescence in-situ hybridization on both spermatocytes and sperm nuclei were performed in two <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers,</b> t(11; 17) (q 13. 1;p 11. 2) and t(10; 14) (q 24;q 32). RESULTS: A ring configuration was the main type of quadrivalent found in metaphase I. Overall chiasma frequency was significantly decreased in the t(11; 17) carrier. In the t(10; 14) carrier, chiasma frequency within the interstitial region of chromosomes 10 and 14 was increased and the recombination pattern was modified. As expected from the frequencies of interstitial chiasmata found in metaphase I in the two subjects, the incidence of asymmetric dyads was sporadic in t(11; 17) and very high in t(10; 14). In both carriers, segregation frequencies observed at metaphase II were not different from the segregation data obtained in decondensed sperm nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The concordance observed among results obtained in different spermatogenic stages indicates an absence of cellular selection based on chromosomal imbalances.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequency and type of chromosome segregation patterns in cleavage stage embryos obtained from male carriers of Robertsonian (ROB) and reciprocal (REC) translocations undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at our reproductive center. We used FISH to analyze chromosome segregation in 308 day 3 cleavage stage embryos obtained from 26 patients. The percentage of embryos consistent with normal or balanced segregation (55. 1 % vs. 27. 1 %) and clinical pregnancy (62. 5 % vs. 19. 2 %) rates were higher in ROB than the REC <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers.</b> Involvement of non-acrocentric chromosome(s) or terminal breakpoint(s) in reciprocal translocations was associated with an increase in the percent of embryos consistent with adjacent 1 but with a decrease in 3 â¶ 1 segregation. Similar results were obtained in the analysis of nontransferred embryos donated for research. 3 â¶ 1 segregation was the most frequent segregation type in both day 3 (31 %) and spare (35 %) embryos obtained from carriers of t(11; 22) (q 23;q 11), the only non-random REC with the same breakpoint reported in a large number of unrelated families mainly identified by the birth of a child with derivative chromosome 22. These results suggest that chromosome segregation patterns in day 3 and nontransferred embryos obtained from male <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> vary with the type of translocation and involvement of acrocentric chromosome(s) or terminal breakpoint(s). These results should be helpful in estimating reproductive success in <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> undergoing PGD...|$|R

The first method utilized three DNA probes (a telomeric and a centromeric probe on chromosome 1 plus a centromeric probe on chromosome 10) to analyze segregation patterns, in sperm, of the chromosomes involved in the translocation. The aggregate frequency of sperm products from alternate and adjacent I segregation was 90. 5 %, and the total frequency of normal and chromosomally balanced sperm was 48. 1 %. The frequencies of sperm products from adjacent II segregation and from 3 : 1 segregation were 4. 9 % and 3. 9 %, respectively. Reciprocal sperm products from adjacent I segregation deviated significantly from the expected 1 : 1 ratio (P <. 0001). Our assay allowed us to evaluate recombination events in the interstitial segments at adjacent II segregation. The frequencies of sperm products resulting from interstitial recombination in chromosome 10 {{were significantly higher than}} those resulting from interstitial recombination in chromosome 1 (P <. 006). No evidence of an interchromosomal effect on aneuploidy was found by use of a second FISH method that simultaneously utilized four chromosome-specific DNA probes to quantify the frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes X, Y, 18, and 21.

40|$|Structural {{chromosome}} aberrations {{and associated}} segmental or chromosomal aneusomies are major causes of reproductive failure in humans. Despite {{the fact that}} carriers of reciprocal balanced translocation often have no other clinical symptoms or disease, impaired chromosome homologue pairing in meiosis and karyokinesis errors lead to over-representation of <b>translocations</b> <b>carriers</b> in the infertile population and in recurrent pregnancy loss patients. At present, clinicians have no means to select healthy germ cells or balanced zygotes in vivo, but in vitro fertilization (IVF) followed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) offers <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> a chance to select balanced or normal embryos for transfer. Although a combination of telomeric and centromeric probes can differentiate embryos that are unbalanced from normal or unbalanced ones, a seemingly random position of breakpoints in these IVF-patients poses a serious obstacle to differentiating between normal and balanced embryos, which for most translocation couples, is desirable. Using a <b>carrier</b> with reciprocal <b>translocation</b> t(4; 13) as an example, we describe our state-of-the-art approach to the preparation of patient-specific DNA probes that span or 'extent' the breakpoints.

The optimized probes will then be suitable for interphase cell analysis, a prerequisite for PGD since blastomeres are biopsied from normally growing day 3 â embryos regardless of their position in the mitotic cell cycle.

40|$|Objective: The {{presence}} of reciprocal and Robertsonian chromosomal rearrangement is often related to recurrent miscarriage. Using preimplantation genetic diagnosis, the abortion rate can be decreased. Cases treated at our center were reviewed. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis for either Robertsonian or reciprocal translocations {{was performed on}} all completed cycles of preimplantation genetic diagnosis at our center since the first reported case in 2004 {{until the end of}} 2010. Day 3 embryo biopsies were carried out, and the biopsied cell was checked by fluorescent in situ hybridization using relevant informative probes. Embryos with a normal or balanced translocation karyotype were transferred on Day 4. Results: Thirty-eight preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles involving 17 couples were completed. A total of 450 (82. 6 %) of the total oocytes were MII oocytes, and 158 (60. 0 %) of the two-pronuclei embryos were biopsied. In 41. 4 % of the fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, the results were either normal or balanced. Embryos were transferred back after 21 cycles. Three babies were born from Robertsonian <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> and another two from reciprocal <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers.</b> The miscarriage rate was 0 %. Among the reciprocal translocation group, the live delivery rate was 8. 3 % per ovum pick-up cycle and 18. 2 % per embryo transfer cycle.

We found that inositol phosphate (IP) -oligosaccharides isolated from the drug Actovegin, {{as well as the}} alkaloid vinblastine, show a partial insulin-like effect on glucose-transport activity of fat-cells (3 -O-methylglucose uptake, expressed as % of equilibrium value per 4 s: basal 5. 8 %, insulin 59 %, IP-oligosaccharides 30 %, vinblastine 29 %) without inducing <b>carrier</b> <b>translocation.</b> On the other hand, two newly developed anti-diabetic compounds (alpha-activated carbonic acids, BM 130795 and BM 13907) induced <b>carrier</b> <b>translocation</b> to the same extent as insulin and phorbol esters [cytochalasin-B-binding sites in plasma membranes: basal 5 pmol/mg of protein, insulin 13 pmol/mg of protein, TPA (12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate) 11. 8 pmol/mg of protein, BM 130795 10. 8 pmol/mg of protein], but produce also only 40 - 50 % of the insulin effect on glucose-transport activity (basal 5. 8 %, insulin 59 %, TPA 23 %, BM 130795 35 %). Almost the full insulin effect was mimicked by a combination of phorbol esters and IP-oligosaccharides (basal 7 %, insulin 50 %, IP-oligosaccharides 30 %, TPA 23 %, IP-oligosaccharides + TPA 45 %). None of these substances stimulated insulin-receptor kinase in vitro or in vivo, suggesting a post-kinase site of action. The data confirm the following aspects of the proposed model: (1) <b>carrier</b> <b>translocation</b> and <b>carrier</b> activation are two independently regulated processes; (2) the full insulin effect is mimicked only by a simultaneous stimulation of <b>carrier</b> <b>translocation</b> and intrinsic <b>carrier</b> activity, suggesting that insulin acts through a synergism of both mechanisms; (3) IP-oligosaccharides might be involved in the transmission of a stimulatory signal on carrier activity...|$|R
40|$|We report 2 {{patients}} from different families with malformation-retardation syndromes {{caused by a}} partial trisomy of the long and of the short arm of chromosome 5, respectively (case 1 : 46,XX,der(3),t(3; 5) (p 27;p 13) mat; case 2 : 46,XY,der(22),t(5; 22) (q 33;q 13) pat). Several members of these families were balanced <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers.</b> Our cases are compared with those cited in the literature. The possibility of delineating a 5 p- and a 5 q-partial-trisomy syndrome is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of an {{unbalanced}} cryptic telomeric translocation 46,XY,der(17),t(9; 17) (q 34. 3;p 13. 3) in a boy with dysmorphic features and developmental delay. The proband had intrauterine growth retardation, postnatal short stature, and mild microcephaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed incomplete myelination, but no evidence of lissencephaly. Cytogenetic analysis of the proband's peripheral blood showed an abnormal 17 p. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with a Miller-Dieker cosmid probe did not detect a deletion for that area. Further analysis with a 17 p telomere specific probe identified an unbalanced telomeric translocation. The same probe {{was used to determine}} the presence of an apparent balanced translocation t(9; 17) (q 34. 3;p 13. 3) in the mother of the proband. The balanced translocation was confirmed with two cosmids that map distally on 9 q 34. 3. Two phenotypically normal half sibs, a maternal aunt, a maternal uncle, and the maternal grandmother were found to be balanced <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> as well. A subtle <b>translocation</b> <b>carriers</b> as well. A subtle translocation is one mechanism that can produce an abnormal phenotype in a patient who had a normal karyotype at lower band resolution levels...|$|R
