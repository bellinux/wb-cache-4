40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [49]) Because of {{the upgrade}} in the accelerator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the collider detectors {{also needed to}} be upgraded. In {{the case of the}} D 0 detector, the detector upgrade includes changes to the muon systems. Part of these changes is the addition of scintillation <b>counters</b> to <b>the</b> central muon trigger. These scintillation counters are referred to as <b>the</b> A-phi <b>counters.</b> NIU's contribution to the D 0 upgrade was to construct and test <b>the</b> small A-phi <b>counters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>counters</b> were tested for efficiency and for the location of the signal amplitude peak. The efficiency tests insured that all of <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> were usable on the detector and gave an initial idea of the kind of variation to be expected between <b>counters.</b> <b>The</b> signal amplitude tests were used to quantify the variation between <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> after <b>the</b> installation of the final phototubes. These amplitude tests allow <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> to be placed into installation groups for the purpose of setting HV levels. They also give the information necessary for the initial fine adjustments to the voltage threshold settings for reading the pulses. The HV and threshold adjustments allow <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> to have matched output when installed on the D 0 detector. Matching the outputs of <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> insures that <b>the</b> data taken from <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> will be able to be analyzed and used as trigger data for Run II of the accelerator.

To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia {{two years before the}} game's events.

At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. <b>The</b> <b>counter</b> decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the countersheets {{were again}} changed, from ABCD to One and Two. (Current sheets are {{twice the size}} of old ones.) In total, <b>the</b> number of <b>counters</b> are <b>the</b> same, but <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> that players may want extras of have been {{segregated}} onto Two, {{so that they can be}} bought separately.

50|$|A stack {{containing}} zeros {{and ones}} can be simulated by two <b>counters</b> when <b>the</b> bits on the stack are {{thought of as}} representing a binary number (the topmost bit on the stack being the least significant bit). Pushing a zero onto the stack is equivalent to doubling the number. Pushing a one is equivalent to doubling and adding 1. Popping is equivalent to dividing by 2, where the remainder is the bit that was popped. Two counters can simulate this stack, in which one of <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> holds a number whose binary representation represents the bits on the stack, and <b>the</b> other <b>counter</b> {{is used as a}} scratchpad. To double the number in <b>the</b> first <b>counter,</b> <b>the</b> FSM can initialize <b>the</b> second <b>counter</b> to zero, then repeatedly decrement <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> once and increment <b>the</b> second <b>counter</b> twice. This continues until <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> reaches zero. At that point, <b>the</b> second <b>counter</b> will hold <b>the</b> doubled number. Halving is performed by decrementing one counter twice and increment the other once, and repeating until <b>the</b> first <b>counter</b> reaches zero. <b>The</b> remainder can be determined by whether it reached zero after an even or an odd number of steps, where the parity of the number of steps is encoded {{in the state of the}} FSM.|$|R

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious pluralism, the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave <b>the</b> <b>Counter</b> Reformation {{a foothold in the}} lower Rhine. Ernst was a product of Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, he invited Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education and pastoral visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction of Catholicism postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E

He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> each time he went in.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato.
