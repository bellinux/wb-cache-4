5|$|A daring {{escape from}} Auschwitz was staged on 20 June 1942 by four Polish prisoners: Eugeniusz Bendera (auto {{mechanic}} at the camp), Kazimierz Piechowski, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, and Józef Lempart. After {{breaking into a}} warehouse, the four dressed {{as members of the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände (the SS units responsible for concentration camps), armed themselves, and stole an SS staff car, which they then drove unchallenged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> gate.|$|E

5|$|A police {{van with}} two {{officers}} arrived {{a short time}} after the shootings began, at around 11:00. They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari, and forced to retreat. From around 11:45 to 12:00 further police units, bolstered {{by a number of}} armoured vehicles, began to arrive on the scene. They attempted to enter the building <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> corridor, but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|NY174 and NY175 {{begin to}} curve to the {{northeast}} as they become parallel with another unsigned county road (CR150), passing Marcellus County Park along the way. The roads remain as such until an intersection where the county road ends and the two state routes split. In downtown Marcellus, the terrain is flat, with residential homes and commercial businesses surrounding the road. At the split, NY174 heads to the west <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> street of the village, while NY175 heads eastward towards Syracuse.|$|E

Time Attack mode allows the player to attempt to completed levels in the quickest time possible.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a 2.5D, third-person {{perspective}} replicating the aesthetic of the television series. The New Kid is able to freely explore {{to the town of}} South Park, interacting with characters and undertaking quests, and accessing new areas by progressing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> story. Selecting one of four character archetypes, Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew, each offering specific abilities, the New Kid and a supporting party of characters use a variety of melee, ranged, and magical fart attacks to combat with their enemies.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

5|$|Dozens of Dementors {{emerge from}} the {{darkness}} while one descends and attempts to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards the riders, and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After shaking the riders out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, the riders enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. They fly over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered on by a series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried out, {{with the first}} train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Inna appears {{wearing a}} yellow dress while {{standing}} on a stair, with her shadow not moving alike to her. When the track's breakdown is played, Inna is presented lying on a XXL-photo of her face, {{and she and her}} backup dancers are particularly shown clapping their hands and performing subtle movements. The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown. Scenes interspersed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> plot portray people performing tribal moves while the video's frame is vertically constrained to just the center of the screen, and two lesbian girls touching their body and picturing themselves.|$|E

5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{fuel valve}} into {{regenerative}} cooling {{systems for the}} nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The airflow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> {{radiator}} {{was controlled}} by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight {{chapters}} and a prologue; {{at the end of}} each chapter, the player is graded on their performance, and all of their statistics and medals are reset. The only items which carry over between chapters are emblems, which are given to the player for achieving high scores in a chapter or defeating hidden monsters. High scores are achieved by defeating more enemies, and defeating enemies with high Panic meters. In addition to the main game is a challenge arena, accessible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> menu, where Keldric can fight timed battles against powerful foes. Keldric can fight alongside AI-controlled pets in these challenges, found in eggs throughout the game. The challenge arena also contains a shop, which contains emblems, eggs, and bonuses like extra music or higher game difficulties, which can be bought with money dropped by enemies throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} two waterdrops {{dropping}} {{in slow motion}} into bubbling water; a cosmetic product floats in it. Subsequently, Inna is shown wearing a white habit and performing hand movements accompanied by a male background dancer sporting black boxer shorts. Following this, the singer kneels {{down on the floor}} while being surrounded by smoke, with the next scene of the clip presenting her wearing a metallic outfit and a bob cut in front of a flames-designed backdrop shown in the opening. The rest of the music video sees Inna and her backup performer further dancing to the song, with scenes interspersed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> clip portraying the singer being engaged with a snake. A special effect was used to duplicate some frames of the visual.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} goals within the games: {{following}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> storyline and defeating the Elite Four and Lance to become the new Champion, and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 251 creatures. A major aspect of this is developing and raising the player's Pokémon by battling other Pokémon, {{which can be found}} in the wild or owned by other Trainers. This system of accumulating experience points (EXP) and leveling up, characteristic and integral to all Pokémon video games, controls the physical properties of the Pokémon, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves learned.|$|E
