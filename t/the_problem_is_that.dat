5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{any small}} {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

25|$|Analysts {{say that}} Lazcano's death does not signify {{the end of}} Los Zetas. As seen in other {{instances}} when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, but <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members {{who are likely to}} resort to violence to maintain their reputation.|$|E
25|$|Often the {{annealing}} process will let bulk impurities diffuse {{to the surface}} and therefore give rise to a re-contamination after each cleaning cycle. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> impurities which adsorb without changing the basic symmetry of the surface, cannot easily be identified in the diffraction pattern. Therefore, in many LEED experiments Auger electron spectroscopy is used to accurately determine the purity of the sample.|$|E
25|$|It is {{this second}} step {{which makes the}} {{technique}} one of non-probability sampling. In quota sampling {{the selection of the}} sample is non-random. For example, interviewers might be tempted to interview those who look most helpful. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these samples may be biased because not everyone gets a chance of selection. This random element is its greatest weakness and quota versus probability has been a matter of controversy for several years.|$|E

25|$|A broad genetic {{sampling}} of 95 wild Russian tigers found markedly low genetic diversity, with the effective population size extraordinarily low {{in comparison to}} the census population size, with the population behaving as if it were just 27–35 individuals. Further exacerbating <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> more than 90% of the population occurs in the Sikhote Alin mountain region, and there is little movement of tigers across the development corridor, which separates this sub-population from the much smaller sub-population found in southwest Primorye province.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} this theory, the {{emergence}} of speech becomes theoretically impossible.

Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have {{found it difficult to}} explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.|$|E
25|$|David is {{a failed}} comedian and rocker who also fails {{to grasp the}} notion of {{political}} correctness.

25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes {{at the end of a}} very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} no traces of any Dorians {{anywhere}} until {{the start of the}} Geometric period about 950 BC. This simple pottery decoration appears to be correlated with other changes in material culture, such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean group burials in tholos tombs to individual burials and cremation. These can certainly be associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC. However, they appear to have been general over all of Greece; moreover, the new weapons would not have been used in 1200.|$|E

25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{historical}} record of the Kurds in Azerbaijan is filled with lacunae. For instance, in 1979 there was according to the census no Kurds recorded. Not only did Turkey and Azerbaijan pursue an identical policy against the Kurds, they even employed identical techniques like forced assimilation, manipulation of population figures, settlement of non-Kurds in areas predominantly Kurdish, suppression of publications and abolition of Kurdish as a medium of instruction in schools. Kurdish historical figures such as Sharaf Khan of Bitlis and Ahmad Khani and the Shaddadid dynasty as a whole were described as Azeris. Kurds who retained 'Kurdish' as their nationality on their internal passports as opposed to 'Azeri' were unable to find employment.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E
50|$|As {{passenger}} car performance increased during the 1970s, the need arose for improved tire capability. One {{of the possibilities}} was to reduce sidewall height, low sidewalls being common at the time on crossply racing tires, but not usual for the better-performing radial tire. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> reducing sidewall height compromised tire comfort, {{in part due to}} the roadwheel rim profile used.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> statisticians {{have tended}} {{not to publish}} their match lists with their findings.

2500|$|Even at {{an early}} stage in his work Serre had {{perceived}} a need to construct more general and refined cohomology theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cohomology of a coherent sheaf over a finite field couldn't capture as much topology as singular cohomology with integer coefficients. [...] Amongst Serre's early candidate theories of 1954–55 was one based on Witt vector coefficients.|$|R
