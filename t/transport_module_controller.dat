This work presents a numerical model to predict asphaltene {{deposition in}} wellbores/pipelines. This model consists of two modules: a Thermodynamic <b>Module</b> and a <b>Transport</b> <b>Module.</b> The Thermodynamic Module models asphaltene precipitation using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State with Peneloux volume translation (PR-Peneloux EOS).

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{introduce}} a clean-slate architecture {{for improving the}} delivery of data packets in IEEE 802. 11 wireless mesh networks. Opposed to the rigid TCP/IP layer architecture which exhibits serious deficiencies in such networks, we propose a unitary layer approach that combines both routing and transport functionalities in a single layer. The new Mesh Transmission Layer (MTL) incorporates cross-interacting routing and <b>transport</b> <b>modules</b> for a reliable data delivery based on the loss probabilities of wireless links. Due to the significant drawbacks of standard TCP over IEEE 802. 11, we particularly focus on the <b>transport</b> <b>module,</b> proposing a pure rate-based approach for transmitting data packets according to the current contention in the network. By considering the IEEE 802. 11 spatial reuse constraint and employing a novel acknowledgment scheme, the new <b>transport</b> <b>module</b> improves both goodput and fairness in wireless mesh networks. In a comparative performance study, we show that MTL achieves up to 48 % more goodput and up to 100 % less packet drops than TCP/IP, while maintaining excellent fairness results...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} Dynamic Deep Neural Networks (D 2 NN), a {{new type}} of feed-forward deep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only a subset of D 2 NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined by the D 2 NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D 2 NNs provide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selective execution, a D 2 NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclic graph of differentiable <b>modules)</b> with <b>controller</b> <b>modules.</b> Each <b>controller</b> <b>module</b> is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether other modules can execute. A D 2 NN is trained end to end. Both regular and <b>controller</b> <b>modules</b> in a D 2 NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize both accuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integrating backpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments of various D 2 NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate that D 2 NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

40|$|The ALICE Time of Flight Detector system {{comprises}} {{more than}} 100. 000 channels and covers {{an area of}} more than 100 m 2. The timing resolution should be better than 150 ps. This combination of requirements poses a major challenge to the readout system. All detector timing measurements are referenced to a unique start signal t 0. This signal is generated at the time an event occurs. Timing measurements are performed using a multichannel TDC chip which requires a 40 MHz reference clock signal. The general concept of the readout system {{is based on a}} modular architecture. Detector cells are combined to modules of 1024 channels. Each of these modules can be read out and calibrated independently from each other. By distributing a reference signal, a timing relationship between the modules is established. This reference signal can either be the start signal t 0 or the TDC-reference clock. The readout architecture is divided into three steps; the TDC <b>controller,</b> the <b>module</b> <b>controller,</b> and the time of flight controller. The TDC controller reads all hit data and stores it into internal memories. Upon arrival of a positive level 1 trigger decision 5 us after the corresponding event hit, data is transferred from the TDC <b>controller</b> to the <b>module</b> <b>controller</b> and stored. In case no positive level 1 trigger decision has been issued, corresponding data is discarded in the TDC controller or alternatively can be transferred to the <b>module</b> <b>controller</b> for monitoring reasons. The <b>module</b> <b>controller</b> prepares the data transmission to the data acquisition. In case a positive level 2 trigger decision is issued, the <b>module</b> <b>controller</b> ships the corresponding data to the time of flight controller. The maximum level 2 trigger latency will not exceed 100 us. The time of flight controller acts as a data concentrator and as interface to the ALICE data acquisition for the entire time of flight detector. A major challenge of the time of flight detector readout is its calibration. Due to change of temperature or even due to mechanical stress imposed to cables transmission delays will change. Although it is not expected that these changes of delays will occur on a short term basis, permanent monitoring must be foreseen. In order not to be dependent entirely on offline analysis to calibrate the readout system, an online electronic calibration and monitoring system is going to be implemented. Transmission of calibration pulses from the TDC electronics to the front-end electronics allows monitoring of delay changes online. A model of the readout system has been developed which copes with the requirements given by the experiment. The readout architecture has been adapted both to the environment given by the detector and to the requirements given by the ALICE trigger and data acquisition. This optimization process was carried out using the hardware description language VHDL. It is planned to complete an FPGA based prototype of the TDC readout by the end of 1999. Furthermore, investigations concerning the distribution of the reference signal t 0, the system clock, and the calibration signals are going to be performed...|$|R
