5|$|Jagger {{left school}} in 1961 after passing seven O-levels and three A-levels. With Richards, {{he moved into}} a flat in Edith Grove, Chelsea, London, with guitarist Brian Jones. While Richards and Jones planned <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> rhythm and blues group, Blues Incorporated, Jagger {{continued}} to study business on a government grant as an undergraduate student at the London School of Economics, and had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the latter to a pop star.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former {{executives}} at ABC, left the network <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> production company. At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork & Mindy, Three's Company, and Welcome Back, Kotter. The two decided {{that in order}} to get a sitcom to sell for their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby, who, during the 1970s, starred in two failed sitcoms, produced award-winning stand up comedy albums, and had roles in several different films, was relatively quiet during the early 1980s.|$|E

30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{evidence on}} self-employment and entrepreneurship interventions for youth is very limited, especially in developing countries. However, as was noted earlier, the meta-analysis of youth programs by Kluve et al. (2016) identified entrepreneurship programs, along with training, {{as the most}} effective interventions in low- and middle-income countries. While an extensive body of evidence is lacking, most researchers agree on two factors that are important for successful youth self-employment and entrepreneurship programming (African Development Bank (AfDB) et al., 2012). One is targeting, since not all young people are inclined or suited <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> business. The other is providing both financing and technical support, since both capital and know-how can be obstacles to young entrepreneurs.|$|R
