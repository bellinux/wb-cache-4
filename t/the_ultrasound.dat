5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{equipment}} must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide invaluable information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} color Doppler <b>ultrasound</b> in <b>the</b> diagnosis of traumatic retinal detachment. METHODS:All 50 cases(56 eyes) of suspicious traumatic retinal detachment from January to June in 2013 were enrolled in this study. All first received <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>ultrasound,</b> then <b>the</b> color Doppler <b>ultrasound,</b> finally, these results were compared {{with the results of}} surgery. RESULTS:All 56 eyes were observed intravitreal abnormal spots by <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>ultrasound,</b> and 39 eyes were observed color blood signal by <b>the</b> color Doppler <b>ultrasound.</b> Forty eyes were approved retinal detachment by surgery. CONCLUSION: It is better to display the intravitreal abnormal spots and color blood signal by <b>the</b> color Doppler <b>ultrasound</b> than by <b>the</b> two-dimensional <b>ultrasound,</b> so there is important clinical significance of <b>the</b> color Doppler <b>ultrasound</b> in <b>the</b> diagnosis of traumatic retinal detachment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{collects}} {{the experimental}} results {{obtained in the}} Thermal Fluid Dynamics Lab at the Department of Energy and Engineering Systems at the University of Pisa, concerning <b>the</b> influence of <b>ultrasounds</b> in single phase free convection and in pool saturated boiling, at atmospheric pressure. The authors have just reported in previous papers their results about the enhancement induced {{by the presence of}} ultrasonic waves in subcooled boiling conditions. <b>The</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> are applied at the set frequency of 40 kHz, with a transducer output changing from 300 to 500 W, on a circular horizontal cylinder heated by Joule effect, immersed in distilled water. The tests in single phase free convection, without ultrasonic waves, are validated by means of the classical correlations reported in literature. Moreover, the authors managed to correlate the data also in presence of <b>ultrasounds.</b> <b>The</b> enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient is lower than the one obtained in subcooled boiling and with regards to the saturated pool boiling conditions, as far as for subcooling degrees very close to <b>the</b> saturation, <b>the</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> cause a decrease of the heat transfer.

25|$|Ultrasound (US) and {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection.

25|$|Ultrasonographic {{examination}} can {{be useful}} in evaluating questionable asymptomatic kidney tumours and cystic renal lesions if Computed Tomography imaging is inconclusive.

25|$|An {{echocardiogram}} can, {{within certain}} limits, produce an accurate {{assessment of the}} direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, abnormal communications between {{the left and right}} side of the heart, leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may {{be mistaken for a}} fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Follow-up imaging {{in women}} of {{reproductive}} age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound {{is not needed}} until 5cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5to 7cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because {{it may be difficult}} to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> beam. For the corpus luteum, a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3cm in diameter. In postmenopausal patients, any simple cyst greater than 1cm but less than 7cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the better}} {{documented}} cultural norms that augment gender disparities in health is the preference for sons. In India, for instance, the 2001 census recorded only 93 girls per 100 boys. This is a sharp decline from 1961, {{when the number of}} girls per 100 boys was nearly 98. In certain parts of India, such as Kangra and Rohtak the number of girls for every 100 boys can be as low as in the 70s. Additionally, low female to male numbers have also been recorded in other Asian countries – most notably in China where, according to a survey in 2005, only 84 girls were born for every 100 boys. Although this was a slight increase from 81 during 2001–2004, it is still much lower than the 93 girls per 100 boys in the late 1980s. The increasing number of unborn girls in the late 20th century has been attributed to technological advances that made pre-birth sex determination, also known as prenatal sex discernment, such as <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> test more affordable and accessible to a wider population. This allowed parents who prefer a son to determine the sex of their unborn child during the early stages of pregnancy. By having early identification of their unborn child's sex, parents could practice sex-selective abortion, where they would abort the fetus if it was not the preferred sex, which in most cases is that of the female.|$|E

500|$|Ultrasonography {{is based}} on the {{principle}} that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces {{in the same way that}} light can reflect back on itself, from a mirror. Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance, known as acoustic impedance, to the path of <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> beam. When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues, the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound. When <b>the</b> <b>ultrasound</b> beam meets air, or solid tissue such as bone, their [...] impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures. The examiner will see just a shadow, instead of the image expected. Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used. The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe, and the patient's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body. The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves. Liquids, including blood have a low impedance, which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible. One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen, in what is termed [...] "spontaneous contrast".|$|E
500|$|Alyeska {{reported}} {{that about half}} were too minor to affect {{the running of the}} pipeline, but questions lay with more than a thousand welds that might be dangerous. Re-examining the welds would be extremely difficult, since those sections of pipeline were sealed (and in many cases buried). By July, the U.S. Congress began holding hearings into the welding problems. President Gerald Ford sent a team to Alaska to oversee and examine Alyeska's work. At the recommendations of this team and to avoid further investigations, Alyeska began repairing the welds on its own. By September, more than 3,000 of the questionable welds had been redone or certified as safe. Alyeska asked for waivers on the remaining 612 welds, and more hearings resulted. By the end of November, only 34 welds were still at issue. The leader of Ford's team ordered 31 of the welds to be dug up and re-done. Waivers were granted for only three welds, all of which were buried [...] under the Koyukuk River south of the Brooks Range. Proof of the integrity of questionable welds were evaluated by a unique solution in Section Five north of the Brooks Range.
