25|$|In {{areas such}} as Newfoundland, the birds, along with the related <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre,</b> are {{referred}} to as 'turrs' or 'tuirs', and are consumed. The meat is dark and quite oily, due to the birds' diet of fish. Eggs have also been harvested. Eggers from San Francisco took almost half a million eggs a year from the Farallon Islands in the mid-19th century to feed the growing city.|$|E
25|$|The auks are {{a family}} of seabirds related to the gulls and terns which {{contains}} several genera. The common murre {{is placed in the}} guillemot (murre) genus Uria (Brisson, 1760), which it shares with the <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre</b> or Brunnich's guillemot, U. lomvia. These species, together with the razorbill, little auk and the extinct great auk make up the tribe Alcini. This arrangement was originally based on analyses of auk morphology and ecology.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre,</b> black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur.

500|$|About thirty {{species of}} bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million {{individuals}} during late summer. The most common are little auk, northern fulmar, <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre</b> and black-legged kittiwake. Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the snow bunting and the wheatear. Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter.

2500|$|Some {{individuals}} in the North Atlantic, known as [...] "bridled guillemots", have a white ring around the eye extending back as a white line. This is not a distinct subspecies, but a polymorphism that becomes more common the farther north the birds breed—perhaps character displacement with the northerly <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre,</b> which has a white bill-stripe but no bridled morph. The white is highly contrasting especially in the latter species and would provide an easy means for an individual bird to recognize conspecifics in densely packed breeding colonies.|$|E
2500|$|Not every {{bird species}} builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including common murre, <b>thick-billed</b> <b>murre</b> and razorbill—lay their eggs {{directly}} onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites. [...] The eggs of these species are dramatically pointed at one end, so that they roll in a circle when disturbed. This is critical {{for the survival of}} the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling {{off the side of the}} cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other abiotic factors.|$|E

40|$|When {{resources}} are limited and similar species co-occur, ecological segregation {{is likely to}} occur year-round, through spatial, temporal, behavioural and/or dietary segregation. This study investigates year-round ecological segregation between partially sympatric, congeneric <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> (Uria lomvia) and Common Murres (Uria aalge). In the Northwest Atlantic, the species exhibit a latitudinal divergence in breeding distributions. However, both winter in Low Arctic regions, where the potential for spatial overlap is greater than during the breeding period. Given the inaccessibility of murres at sea, the inter- and intra-specific interactions of murres wintering in the Northwest Atlantic have not been previously studied. Using tracking devices and isotopic analyses, this study integrates spatial and temporal movements during the nonbreeding period, relative overlap of winter habitat, and trophic positions during the nonbreeding period. <b>Thick-billed</b> and Common <b>Murres</b> remained partially segregated throughout the year, with some overlap among particular colony groups. <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> moved over {{a broad range of}} latitudes throughout the year, had varied core wintering locations, encountered variable environmental conditions, made variable seasonal movements, and had broad trophic positioning. In comparison, Common Murres concentrated and converged on more narrow wintering areas, where colonies had high spatial overlap, encountered similar environmental conditions with consistent temporal patterns, and occupied similar trophic positions. Habitat segregation occurred mostly spatially; but where spatial overlap was greater, inter-specific dietary segregation increased. Most individual murres (both species) exhibited consistent wintering strategies across 2 - 3 years, with a few individuals shifting habitats between years. Variation in winter movement patterns stemmed more from between-individual variation (particularly among <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres)</b> than from annual changes within individuals. Ecological segregation is expressed through more varied movement, habitat use, and diets of <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres,</b> resulting in a wider ecological niche that is related both to the range of available habitat and prey, and to inter-specific competitive interactions with Common Murres. Relative connectivity among species and colonies at wintering sites also has implications for overall population vulnerability to spatially-discrete risks or wintering conditions, which will be greater for the relatively concentrated Common Murres than for more dispersed <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres...</b>|$|R

40|$|Individual {{wintering}} {{strategies and}} patterns of winter site fidelity in successive years are highly variable among seabird species. Yet, an understanding of consistency in timing of movements {{and the degree of}} site fidelity is essential for assessing how seabird populations might be influenced by, and respond to, changing conditions on wintering grounds. To explore annual variation in migratory movements and wintering areas, we applied bird-borne geolocators on <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> (Uria lomvia, n = 19) and Common Murres (U. aalge, n = 20) from 5 colonies in the Northwest Atlantic for 2 – 4 consecutive years. <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> ranged widely and among-individual wintering strategies were highly variable, whereas most Common Murres wintered relatively near their colonies, with among-individual variation represented more by the relative use of inshore vs. offshore habitat. Within individuals, some aspects of the wintering strategy were more repeatable than others: colony arrival and departure dates were more consistent by individual Common than <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres,</b> while the sizes of home ranges (95 % utilization distributions) and distances travelled to wintering area were more repeatable for both species. In consecutive years, individual home ranges overlapped from 0 – 64 % (<b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres)</b> and 0 – 95 % (Common Murres); and the winter centroids were just 239 km and 169 km apart (respectively).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} the energy store (defined as the size of lipid stores) dynamics in breeding Arctic seabirds. The first chapter compares three species feeding at similar trophic levels but with different life history, physiological and foraging strategies, and breeding strategies. They managed their stores differently during poor environmental conditions. Though lipids were the primary tissue driving changes in body composition in <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> and Northern Fulmars, lean tissues were most dynamic in Black-legged Kittiwakes. Chapter two presents a method for evaluating the size of lipid stores non-lethally in <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> and Northern Fulmars using plasma fatty acid composition and concentration. Traditional (morphometric) tools had less predictive ability (especially for <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres)</b> than plasma fatty acids. In Chapter three, I show that the plasma fatty acid signatures of <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> breeding at low and high Arctic colonies differ; likely an effect of differing diets. In addition, the concentration of plasma fatty acids increases during the breeding season, and is highest during chick-rearing. It is proposed that this may reflect a greater need for metabolic fuels as chick-rearing is likely the period of greatest energy expenditure. In Chapter four, {{the results of an}} egg replacement study are presented. <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Murres</b> were made to lay a replacement egg following the removal of the first laid egg. The fatty acid signatures of the female and male plasma and of the first and replacement eggs were identified. Fatty acid signatures of eggs were highly conserved and those fatty acids found in the highest concentration in eggs were depleted in females after laying the replacement egg. In addition, from comparisons of the fatty acid signatures of eggs and potential prey species, I suggest that local sources of fatty acids could be utilised for the production of the replacement egg. In Chapter five, the way in which breeding adults manage an increase in the cost of diving is examined. In two experiments, conducted during two breeding seasons, the chick growth and plasma fatty acid concentrations of handicapped versus control adults were compared. Generally, adults passed on the increase in cost of diving to their chicks as chick mass gain was significantly less in some of the treatment groups. In addition, a feeding watch study suggests that this was because handicapped adults fed their chicks less frequently than control groups. This thesis represents the most physiologically intensive studies that have been conducted to date on wild breeding auks and is presented {{in the context of the}} potential effects of environmental change...|$|R
