5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo.

Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors.
