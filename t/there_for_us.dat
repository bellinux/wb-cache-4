25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't give {{permission}} {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are. They were <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to enjoy and they were <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is very wrong for all of us. The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|E
500|$|Harrison echoed Martin's {{description}} of his stabilising role: [...] "I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; {{but he was always}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{the band}} hired {{producer}} Tchad Blake, {{known for his}} use of binaural recording. Binaural recording techniques, which employ two microphones to create a 3-D stereophonic sound, [...] were utilized on several tracks, such as the acoustic [...] "Of the Girl." [...] Regarding Blake, Gossard said, [...] "He was just <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> the whole time, wanting us to create different moods." [...] This was the first Pearl Jam studio album following the departure of drummer Jack Irons, and features drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who had previously drummed on Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed out}} of the theatre into the street, The brougham was <b>there</b> waiting <b>for</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... :The {{dark side}} is always <b>there,</b> waiting <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to enter — waiting to enter us.:Until next time, try {{to enjoy the}} daylight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor old Ralph!" [...] he said. [...] "Well, {{we did our}} best, and <b>there's</b> room <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{somewhere in}} this wide country. I suppose it is--hopeless--absolutely?" ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{television}} reviewer Hayden Childs {{commented that}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] was [...] "somewhat amusing {{and far more}} coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough." [...] Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this {{one out of the}} park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening the best {{in the history of the}} show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. Always <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfram {{has since}} {{expressed}} [...] "A central lesson of A New Kind of Science is that there’s {{a lot of}} incredible richness {{out there in the}} computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to 'mine' and harness for our purposes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atlas {{has always}} spoken {{her mind about}} the way both she and Transglobal Underground were seen by the UK press {{back in the late}} 90s/early 2000. [...] "Someone from the New Musical Express rang us about a feature we're to do with them and said 'We don't want it to be about the multi-cultural angle'. In other words that fad is over. And I'm {{personally}} insulted... what other angle is <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us?!</b> I get sick of it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{to be done}} now, Prince of Ladder-makers?" [...] said Thumb presently. [...] "Are we not {{weary of}} wandering? <b>There's</b> room <b>for</b> <b>us</b> all in those great shadowy bellies." ...|$|R
60|$|Is <b>there</b> {{any hope}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> of you before the winter ends? Do consider.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you don't}} say! They remind me mostly {{of a sick}} horse. But it's elegant to have the {{soldiers}} with us, though Monsieur Fardet tells me <b>there's</b> nothing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to be scared about." ...|$|R
2500|$|Garner has {{campaigned for}} laws {{to protect her}} {{children}} from paparazzi. [...] "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes {{at the same time}} every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids." [...] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.|$|E
60|$|Our cue was <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> Bud {{had made}} a good guess. You couldn't lose Jacks. He chimed in next.|$|E
6000|$|... 'None at all, sir. Most of 'em, as you know, {{have stopped}} short; {{and the few}} that are left are going further on. What matters that! More room <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|If a man's conduct {{cannot be}} {{ascribed}} to the angelic, nor to the bestial within him, what is <b>there</b> left <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to refer to it, but the fiendish? Passion without any appetite is fiendish.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Speak on, Maxtla,' said Otomie, 'for we must {{hear what}} <b>there</b> is <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to answer, and you, {{people of the}} Otomie, I pray you keep silence, that you may judge between us {{when there is an}} end of talking.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on, Silas! If <b>there's</b> {{a chance}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> Minute Boys {{to have a}} finger in any pie that is baking, don't let's linger here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the odds?" [...] growled {{one of the}} seamen. [...] "They won't look <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> for a {{long time}} to come, unless Cap'n Bligh borrows a pair of wings from an albatross, an' goes home as the crow flies." ...|$|E
60|$|Now up to {{this time}} we had been so {{fortunate}} as not to have {{come in contact with}} the patrol or any straggling lobster back, {{and it would have been}} possible, had we gone directly <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to have gained the ship-yard unobserved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good, Lestrade, very good," [...] said Holmes. [...] "Your theory holds together. But {{if this is}} true, {{then the}} case is at an end. On the one hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington {{submarine}} are presumably already on the Continent. What is <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{matter is}} that we are tied here all these hours instead of being in Cambridge where, mayhap, <b>there</b> is plenty <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} up the shallop," [...] said Carver, [...] "and send a picked company {{to see what}} {{entertainment}} <b>there</b> may be <b>for</b> <b>us</b> on shore." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Bertie {{returned}} he said, [...] "Here {{is a lot}} of food, Harry, {{they have}} hardly eaten anything. <b>There</b> is plenty <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to-day and to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then came a great cheer, and Mrs. Block--who, {{having been}} {{assured that the}} whale had entirely disappeared, had come on deck--turned {{to her husband and}} remarked: [...] "Now, Sammy, is there any earthly reason why we should not turn right around and go {{straight}} home? The pole's found, and the place is marked, and what more is <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{our only}} hope. In this crowded land {{there is no}} fastness, no shelter. What place is <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> among these multitudes? They who are little can hide from one another, but where are we to hide? There is no place where we could eat, no place where we could sleep. If we fled--night and day they would pursue our footsteps." ...|$|E
6000|$|DUKE. [Continuing {{to lecture}} with enthusiasm.] Why, everything's {{temperament}}, you know! It's her temperament {{to see the}} fairies. It's my temperament not to see the fairies. Why, I've walked all round the grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy. Well, it's like that about this wizard or whatever she calls it. For her there is somebody <b>there.</b> <b>For</b> <b>us</b> {{there would not be}} somebody there. Don't you see? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are <b>there</b> no tidings <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> mademoiselle?" [...] asked Eve, {{after another}} long pause, {{during which she}} had poured out her {{gratitude}} in trembling, but secret thanksgivings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Och, then, but we'd {{have stood}} a bad chance {{in a fight}} if thim's the wipons they use. Och, the dirty spalpeens! Martin, dear, we're done <b>for.</b> <b>There's</b> no chance <b>for</b> <b>us</b> at all." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{speaking}} about the song, Vedder stated:It feels a little strange talking about love that openly, but if you can't do it now, when can you do it? Love is one resource that the corporations aren't {{going to be able}} to monopolize. Which means <b>there's</b> hope <b>for</b> <b>us</b> human beings yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a mistake," [...] I maintain, [...] "an {{unprecedented}} mistake. There's the difficulty. If you inquire {{you will}} find it begin to unravel. What reason is <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to remain casual workmen here, when you allege we are men of position in the world, if there isn't something wrong? We shall stick to this wood-carving work you have found us here, and meanwhile I {{think you ought to}} inquire again. That's how the thing shapes to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what was}} <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to do? In {{the morning the}} two schooners from {{windward}} sailed down upon us {{in the middle of}} the lagoon. The trade wind was blowing fresh, and by scores of canoes they ran us down. And the rifles never ceased talking. We scattered like flying fish before the bonita, and there were so many of us that we escaped by thousands, this way and that, to the islands on the rim of the atoll.|$|E
6000|$|... "Broadly speaking, {{everything}} {{between those}} two lines belongs to the new German Empire. Poland, Courland, Lithuania, and the Ukraine will possess {{a certain degree of}} autonomous government, which will practically amount to nothing. Asia is there at our feet. No longer will Great Britain control the supplies of the world. Raw materials of every description will be ours. Leather, tallow, wheat, oil, fats, timber--they are all <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to draw upon. And for wealth--India and China! What more could you have, my friend?" ...|$|E
60|$|According to Lieutenant Frazier's {{laying out}} of the work, <b>there</b> was nothing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> of the Avenger to do save care for the schooner, and prepare the meals.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Heart up, Jack," [...] says I. [...] "Methinks <b>there's</b> one {{fighting}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> that, like a fool, I've {{forgot all}} this summer." [...] My meaning was naturally the planet Mars.|$|R
5000|$|Palfrey once said, [...] "Tennis is {{the best}} game there is. It {{combines}} mental and physical qualities and is the sport for a lifetime. And there are many living examples {{at the age of}} 80 to prove it. So it is enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to know that tennis will remain, under whatever conditions, whether amateur or pro, the finest game <b>there</b> is <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>for</b> our children, and our children's children." ...|$|R
