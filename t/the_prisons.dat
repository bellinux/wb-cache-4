5|$|Eighteenth-century prisons were {{effectively}} lodging houses. Poorly {{maintained and}} often filthy, they might {{consist of a}} couple of rooms in a cellar. Before the Gaols Act 1823, then <b>the</b> <b>Prisons</b> Act of 1835 and 1877, they were administered by the royal household, the aristocracy and the bishops, and run for profit by private individuals who bought the right to manage and make money from them.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prison,</b> {{two stories}} tall, was {{initially}} designed with having two prisoners in one cell. <b>The</b> <b>prison</b> cells were pre-fabricated {{and brought to}} <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> construction site for assembly into <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>prison</b> was to have 800 security cameras.|$|R

5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare. The department was at the same time renamed <b>the</b> <b>Prisons</b> Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Christensen got {{in contact with}} Valgard Murray and Elton Hall, Heathens {{operating}} a kindred in Arizona, and in 1976 their group {{would be the first}} to be certified by the Odinist Fellowship. During the early 1980s she established a prison-outreach program in the hope of attracting incarcerated individuals to Odinism, in doing so getting Odinism legal recognition as a religion from the state of Florida. In <b>the</b> <b>prisons,</b> the Odinist Fellowship organised four seasonal festivals a year that were marked with sumbel as well as commemorating Hitler's birthday.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{law is the}} law {{governing}} a person's family matters. In Shafeeg bin Salim Talib v.

50|$|On 30 December 1918 <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> {{was taken}} over by Polish insurgents of the Greater Poland Uprising.

5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, <b>the</b> <b>Prisons</b> Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of <b>the</b> <b>Prisons</b> in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Villermé {{published}} Des prisons telles qu'elles sont et telles qu'elles devraient être (On Prisons as They Are and as They Should Be) in 1820. In {{this work}} he {{called attention to}} the unhealthy conditions of <b>the</b> <b>prisons</b> in Paris. He outlined several components of the prison systems that he believed should be abolished including torture, ill treatment, cells, and unequal treatment of prisoners based on the amount of money men are able to give up. Villermé urged the government of Paris to take after the newly reformed prison systems of the United States and Russia. His goal was to persuade officials to reevaluate the unhealthy living environments and treatments of men in prisons so that men are able to become functioning citizens upon their release. This work in particular reflects the multifaceted approach Villermé took in his research, combining knowledge of medicine, data analysis, and social epidemiology.|$|E

5|$|Strachwitz and his {{men were}} {{questioned}} by a French captain and accused of being spies and saboteurs. They {{were taken to the}} prison at Châlons the next day where they were separated. Strachwitz, as an officer, was placed in solitary confinement. Early in the morning they were all lined up for the firing squad, but a French captain arrived just in time to stop the execution. Strachwitz {{and his men}} were then tried before a French military court on 14 October 1914. The court sentenced them all to five years of forced labour on the prison island of Cayenne. At the same time they were deprived of rank, thus losing the status of prisoners of war. Strachwitz was then taken to <b>the</b> <b>prisons</b> at Lyon and Montpellier, and then to the Île de Ré, from where the prison ship would depart for Cayenne. It is unclear what circumstances prevented his departure, but he was imprisoned at Riom and Avignon instead. At Avignon prison he was physically and mentally tortured by both the guards and the other prisoners. This included being chained naked to a wall, deprivation of food and severe beatings. After one year at Avignon he was given a German uniform and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Barraux.|$|E
