5|$|I. C. Filitti {{was not in}} {{a celebratory}} mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the {{military}} ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.|$|E

The buildings formerly occupied by the fighter wing, including the hangars, will be occupied by the intelligence mission.|$|E

I've never stopped to think about what others are saying. I just rely on my abilities. Later on, I started to {{practice}} penalties and free kicks until they gave me the job for real". Chilavert admitted <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>behind</b> after training <b>to</b> practice 80 to 120 free kicks, which in his opinion was how he got better.|$|R

5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent.

Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him.

For his actions in volunteering <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> with the wounded, Herman G.

5|$|Flooding was {{reported}} throughout the Outer Banks {{in relation to}} the heavy rains and storm surge of the storm. The storm required the shutdown of North Carolina Highway 12, the only highway connecting the area to the mainland, isolating those who decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind.</b> Many residents lost power as numerous power lines fell from strong winds. Six brief tornadoes, ranging between F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, struck the state within squall lines in the outer rainbands of Hurricane Bob. Four tornadoes in Dare County, North Carolina, caused $256,000 in damage. Near Cape Hatteras, wind severely damaged one structure, which lost its roof and some siding.|$|E

The field units were held to high standards and took precedence over Limitanei in pay and provisions.|$|R
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind,</b> feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth.

5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with {{the events of the}} day, but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements.

Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
50|$|Alonso swapped to a two-stop {{strategy}} but it {{gave him}} no advantage and he seemed resigned <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>behind</b> Coulthard, while Trulli, {{who had been on}} quite an early charge, also seemed to lose momentum. Ralf's engine unexpectedly gave up midway through the race, the first failure for BMW for 17 races. Felipe Massa, who was having a pretty good race, got held up by a Minardi and did a bit of agitated hand waving as he went by. The gap between Michael and Montoya was holding at around four seconds and Button moved up to third, jumping Raikkonen in the second pit stops. Both of the Finn's stops seemed quite long and eventually he pulled {{off to the side of}} the track with a transmission failure. Disappointing for Raikkonen and McLaren as Kimi was showing good pace until then.|$|R
50|$|In {{what was}} {{expected}} to be a routine victory for the Canadian squad, the Latvian team responded with an early equalizer and managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> alive <b>behind</b> Gudļevskis' goaltending (saving 55 of 57 shots he faced) until late into the third period, eventually falling in a 2-1 loss. Gudļevskis was praised, especially in Canadian media and sports commentary, for his performance in the quarter-final against the Canadian national team.|$|R
50|$|Claymore later {{returned}} to the US, where he tried to help oversee operations after Hawk was crippled in battle.

5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a {{contractor}} and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's relatives {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>behind,</b> as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E

50|$|Edna Purviance {{plays the}} lead as Marie St. Clair. Chaplin had {{several reasons for}} {{producing}} this film, and one of these reasons was to help Purviance gain recognition as an actress without Chaplin at her side. Another was because he wanted <b>to</b> try <b>staying</b> <b>behind</b> the camera and attempt his first real drama. Despite this attempt, Edna Purviance {{was never able to}} achieve the level of success that she had in films with Chaplin's Tramp at her side.
