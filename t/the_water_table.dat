5|$|In around 1720, two key {{innovations}} revolutionised the Cornish mining industry. The whim, a horse-powered {{mechanism for}} lifting ore to the surface, made mining in deep shafts practical, and the horse-powered pump allowed mining beneath <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

5|$|Conceptual {{design of}} a {{permanent}} repository was determined by 1983, calling for placement of copper-clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground, below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> in {{what is known as}} the KBS-3 method. Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay. After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository, three were nominated for further investigation, at Osthammar, Oskarshamn, and Tierp. On 3 June 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep-level waste site at Östhammar, near Forsmark Nuclear Power plant. The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock {{at a depth of}} about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E

5|$|However {{just before}} the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate {{announced}} that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> was limited.|$|E
5|$|Strong ground motions {{caused many}} {{secondary}} effects, including gas leaks and widespread soil liquefaction. Consequently, sand boils emerged from asphalt roads, toppling a few cars and sinking another. Several {{houses in the}} hill suburbs of Sumner and Redcliffs were affected by falling boulders from hillsides. Following its occurrence, much of Christchurch lost water pressure; residents were thus urged to conserve water use. In {{some parts of the}} Heathcote Valley, previously dormant or non-existent natural springs surfaced {{as a consequence of the}} sudden rise in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> flooding some properties.|$|E
5|$|The bunker complex was self-contained. However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E
30|$|The {{variation}} of <b>the</b> ground <b>water</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> weathered rocks during the steeper slope cutting and the reinforcement {{is shown in}} Fig.  5, which is highly dependent on precipitation [7, 8, 9].

40|$|When an inland lake is reclaimed, <b>the</b> phreatic <b>water</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> {{unconfined}} aquifer {{above the}} semi-pervious layer is lowered {{over the area}} of the newly formed polder. The lowering has a large influence on <b>the</b> artesian <b>water</b> level. This <b>water</b> <b>table</b> will drop, with the result that outside <b>the</b> polder <b>water</b> from <b>the</b> unconfined aquifer percolates downward through the semi-previous layer, while inside <b>the</b> polder artesian <b>water</b> percolates upwards through this layer, appreciably increasing the amount of drainage water to be pumped out. This results in lowering of <b>the</b> phreatic <b>water</b> <b>table</b> outside <b>the</b> polder.

5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends down to <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though {{the supply of}} water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|The subsoil {{contains}} a large water table which is alimented by the Vardar river and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an aquifer contained in marl. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is 4 to 12 m {{under the ground}} and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters {{but most of the}} drinking water used in Skopje comes from a karstic spring in Rašče, located west of the city.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, the Jewellery Quarter was {{mentioned}} as being {{at risk of}} flooding by Gareth Morgan, an environment expert at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, due to <b>the</b> rising <b>water</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> city and its location adjacent to Birmingham's canal network. <b>The</b> rising <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is partly {{a result of the}} loss of heavy industry which used to remove large quantities of water.|$|R

5|$|Westhay Moor forms {{part of the}} Somerset Levels and Moors {{which is}} {{important}} for its grazing and ditch system, and is crossed by the River Brue and Galton's Canal. Over much of the moor, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> is high throughout the year with extensive winter flooding occurring regularly. The level of the water tables can be artificially lowered during active working of the peat excavations, but {{for much of the}} year these are often filled with water.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table.</b> In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> upper <b>water</b> <b>table</b> (Eocene strata) {{includes}} two lower-level aquifers up to 90 m in total height. It forms part of <b>the</b> general <b>water</b> <b>table</b> which is fed {{both by the}} watershed of the Seine and Marne and by lower aquifers. It is greatly influenced by precipitation and fluctuates significantly in depth, but in general lies close to the surface, requiring special care in sealing cellars and basements.|$|R

5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is critical in the competition for nutrients.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, but none of these attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>table</b> caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
