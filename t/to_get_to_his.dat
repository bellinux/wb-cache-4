5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes {{as he continued to}} throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} of British {{victories}} along the Caribbean coast, events taking place in Spain would prove {{to have a significant}} effect on the outcome of the largest engagement of the war. Spain had decided to replace Don Pedro Hidalgo as governor of Cartagena de Indias. But, the new governor-designate, Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies Sebastián de Eslava y Lazaga had first to dodge the Royal Navy in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> new post. Starting from the Galician port of Ferrol, the vessels Galicia and San Carlos set out on the journey. Hearing the news, Vernon immediately sent four ships to intercept the Spanish. They were unsuccessful in their mission. The Spanish managed to circumvent the British interceptors and entered the port of Cartagena on 21 April 1740, landing there with the new governor and several hundred veteran soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Commitments by Schwarzenegger {{delayed the}} start of filming by several months. The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter David Peoples. Principal {{photography}} eventually began in the jungles of Palenque, Mexico, near Villahermosa, Tabasco, during {{the second week of}} April 1986, but the film overall was filmed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Much of the material dealing with the unit's deployment in the jungle was completed in a few short weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the dailies provided by McTiernan. On Friday, April 25, production halted so that Schwarzenegger could fly to Hyannis Port in a Learjet chartered by Silver in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wedding on time. He was married on April 26, 1986, to Maria Shriver, and honeymooned for only three days while the second unit completed additional lensing. The production resumed filming on May 12.|$|E
25|$|In early August, the {{lightweight}} Breidis Prescott {{was chosen by}} Rubio as Khan's next opponent. Rubio had trained a fighter who had narrowly lost to Prescott before and thought that Khan {{would be able to}} handle the bigger Prescott, who had a prolific knock-out record of 17 KOs in 19 contests. On 6 September 2008, Khan was a huge favourite and was hoping to win a world title {{by the end of the}} year. Prescott came out fast in the fight and landed some good shots; a stiff jab jerked Khan's head back and foreshadowed what was to come. Prescott landed a left hook that jabbed Khan's temple; dizzying his senses. Instead of holding, Khan tried to punch back, but instead was punched on the head by a left hook, right hook combo, sending him crashing to the canvas. He managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet. Prescott ended it for good with another left that put Khan down again. This time, he was unable to get up. It was officially over in 55 seconds.The fight was at the Manchester Evening News Arena on Khan's Sky Box Office debut.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
25|$|The pair {{continued}} their partnership on Day 5, until a rain delay halted play. Marsh built towards his century before Harris was dismissed (21) after a 69-run stand. Marsh was then desperate <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> hundred before lunch {{and tried to}} push a quick single to mid-off and was run-out for 99. Australia then declared at lunch at 9/318, giving India a target of 384 off 71 overs. India's run chase started terribly when Dhawan (0), KL Rahul (1) and Vijay (11) all fell early with India at 3/19. Ajinkya Rahane (33*) and Virat Kohli (54*) built another partnership as India reached tea at 3/104. Kohli was gone on the first ball after tea with India in trouble. Rahane and Pujara also put on a 37-run stand before Pujara was bowled (21). Rahane (48) was also out shortly after. R Ashwin (8*) and MS Dhoni (24*) lasted out the day when both captains agreed no result was possible and the match was drawn with 4 overs remaining. The draw ensured Australia won the series, a 2-0 lead with one match to go. Ryan Harris was awarded Man of the Match for his 6 wickets in the match and 74 in the first innings. MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket after this match.|$|E
25|$|On {{his second}} patrol (2–28 November 1942), Brandi {{was ordered to}} the Mediterranean Sea where he was placed {{under the command of}} the 29th U-boat Flotilla. His mission in the Mediterranean theater of {{operations}} was to help secure the supply routes for the Afrikakorps in North Africa. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> destination Brandi had to traverse the heavily guarded Strait of Gibraltar. Brandi made the passage on 8 November 1942 submerged. Nevertheless, U-617 was discovered by a British Short Sunderland bomber which dropped two depth charges, but missed. That day, British-American forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch (8–16 November 1942). At 11:27 on 21 November, Brandi attacked a strong British naval task force, firing a spread of four torpedoes at distance. Following the assault, U-617 came under attack. Over four hours, 80 depth charges were dropped on U-617. At 16:00 on 23 November, Brandi unsuccessfully attacked a cruiser before arriving in La Spezia on 28 November 1942. Although no ships were actually sunk that day, the Führer der Unterseeboote Italy (FdU—Leader of U-boat Operations) later credited Brandi with the sinking of one cruiser of French or American origin, and one destroyer. Additionally the FdU acknowledged that Brandi had torpedoed two freighters, their sinking was assumed. The FdU denied him credit for having severely damaged a battleship.|$|E

Ultimately the [...] "Great White Way" [...] project failed, and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support.|$|E
