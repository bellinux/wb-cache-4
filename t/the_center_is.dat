5|$|Five miles (8km) past West Shokan, NY28A intersects Monument Road, {{which used}} to connect to the reservoir's {{spillway}} and the road above the reservoir, which is closed to automobile traffic.

5|$|Just {{past the}} Capital Beltway, the route {{heads into the}} heart of the city of Greenbelt, having an {{interchange}} with MD193 (Greenbelt Road). The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the Wright Brothers taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway's only interchange within <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>is</b> at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular bisector line of any two. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>is</b> the point of intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>center</b> <b>is</b> {{utilized}} {{to connect the}} College of Law and Willamette as a whole to the larger Salem community.

Each of these programs were chosen to be housed in the center due to having community outreach programs, {{with the goal of}} the center being to create a community atmosphere between students, faculty, and the community at large.|$|E
