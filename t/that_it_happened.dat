5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E

Although the Fore's mortuary cannibalism was well documented, the practice had ceased before the cause of the disease was recognized. However, some scholars argue that although post-mortem dismemberment was the practice during funeral rites, cannibalism was not. Marvin Harris theorizes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> during a famine period coincident with the arrival of Europeans and was rationalized as a religious rite.|$|E

The police went to the coliseum searching for him with an arrest warrant. Matias said that the case was already five years old and the complaint was made by a certain Arlene Mendoza, accused him for allegedly stealing her wallet. Matias denied the accusations of stealing Mendoza's wallet, and Matias said he was accused because the suspect looked like him. Matias already left the coliseum before the group went. The incident did not happen just once, Matias said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> before during a game when he played on the Philippine Basketball League. Matias hired a lawyer after the incident to prove his innocence.|$|E
25|$|Sherman {{was able}} to {{concentrate}} his army faster than Beauregard had anticipated and arrived at Columbia {{on the afternoon of}} February 16. The only Confederates defending the city were small detachments from Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler's cavalry division, and Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps from the Army of Tennessee. Heavily outnumbered, Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton ordered an evacuation of the city without a fight, although they destroyed all bridges over the Congaree and Saluda Rivers in an attempt to delay the Union forces. Sherman occupied Columbia the following day. Much of Columbia burned to the ground in a fire that has engendered controversy ever since: some say it started when the Confederates set fire to cotton bales in the city, others say that drunken Union soldiers were fanning the flames of vengeance, while a few witnesses claimed that some of the fires were by accident. James W. Loewen researched the topic for his book, Lies Across America, and found that most likely, the cotton bale fires spread and caused most of the destruction. He did find that there were some fires started by Union soldiers, but the effects of these were minimal. Most likely, the Confederates' scorched earth policy was to blame for the burning of Columbia (in which not much of it burned). After the burning, Sherman was quoted as saying that he never gave the order to burn Columbia to the ground but he was not sorry <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

[...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children.

[...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E

500|$|On March 2, 2017, Deadline {{reported}} that Netflix {{was in the}} process of renewing the lapsed contracts of the series' eight leading actors, to keep them available until June of the same year, suggesting that a positive decision to renew Sense8 for a third season before that time passes was highly possible. In early May 2017, producer Roberto Malerba said that not all eight regulars of the cast had renewed yet, but the process was still going. He additionally disclosed the first season had an average budget of about $4.5 million per episode, and the second season $9 million per episode. Furthermore, he added that a potential third season would likely be the series' last, due to the complicated nature of the series' production, and the fact Lana Wachowski works as a filmmaker on it almost alone. On June 1, 2017, Netflix announced they had cancelled the series after two seasons. Although no official reason for the cancellation was provided in the press release by Netflix, actor Brian J. Smith, who had hinted at the cancellation a couple of days before the announcement was made, has said it was a problem of low viewership compared to the production's cost. Shortly after the cancellation, Malerba commented <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> abruptly by Netflix without providing them an explanation, [...] "just numbers".|$|E

500|$|Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an asterism since the Hellenistic period (or much earlier, according to some authors), {{and is the only}} modern constellation named for an historic figure. It was introduced to Western astronomy during the third century BC by Conon of Samos, the court astronomer of Egyptian ruler Ptolemy III Euergetes, to honour Ptolemy's consort, BereniceII. Berenice vowed to sacrifice her long hair as a votive offering if Ptolemy returned safely from battle during the Third Syrian War. Modern scholars are uncertain if Berenice made the sacrifice before or after Ptolemy's return; it was suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> after Ptolemy's return (around March–June or May 245 BC), when Conon presented the asterism jointly with scholar and poet Callimachus during a public evening ceremony. In Callimachus' poem, Aetia (composed around that time), Berenice dedicated her tresses [...] "to all the gods". In the Latin translation of the poem by the Roman poet Catullus and in Hyginus' De astronomica, she dedicated her tresses to Aphrodite and placed them in the temple of Arsinoe II (identified after Berenice's death with Aphrodite) at Zephyrium. According to De astronomica, by the next morning the tresses had disappeared. Conon proposed that Aphrodite had placed the tresses in the sky as an acknowledgement of Berenice's sacrifice. Callimachus called the asterism plokamos Berenikēs or bostrukhon Berenikēs in Greek, translated into Latin as [...] "Coma Berenices" [...] by Catullus. Eratosthenes (3rd century BC) called it [...] "Berenice's Hair" [...] and [...] "Ariadne's Hair", considering it part of the constellation Leo. The astronomer Geminus (1st century BC) recognized it as a distinct constellation. Astronomer Ptolemy (2nd century AD) considered it part of Leo, and called it Plokamos.|$|E
