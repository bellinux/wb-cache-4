The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E

5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} crew numbered 103 {{officers and}} 1,962 enlisted men. The crew {{was divided into}} twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions {{were assigned to the}} ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary batteries and five and six manning anti-aircraft guns. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The radio operators, signalmen, and quartermasters were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were the engine room personnel. When Bismarck left port, fleet staff, prize crews, and war correspondents increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men. Roughly 200 of the engine room personnel came from the light cruiser , which had been lost during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. Bismarcks crew published a ship's newspaper titled Die Schiffsglocke (The Ship's Bell); <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.|$|E

25|$|As {{a tribute}} item, amate was {{assigned}} to the royal sector because it was not considered to be a commodity. <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> related to power and religion, the way through which the Aztecs imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>is</b> to {{establish}} some estimates for the small-o rates of convergence and large- 0 rates of convergence in limit theorems for randomly indexed sums of independent identically distributed random variables via Trotter-distance.

It is worth noticing that some statements as consequences from some theorems in <b>this</b> <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> considerably weaker than well-known results (see [9] for more details).
