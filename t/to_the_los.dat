40|$|Abstract: We examine squark–gluino loop {{effects on}} the process b → sγ in minimal {{supersymmetry}} with general flavor mixing in the squark sector. In the regime of heavy squarks and gluino, we derive analytic expressions for <b>the</b> beyond–LO corrections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wilson coefficients and find them to be often large, especially at large tan β and µ> 0. The ensuing ranges of values of the Wilson coefficients are typically smaller than in <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> approximation, and sometimes even change sign. This {{has the effect of}} often reducing, relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO,</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of supersymmetric contributions to BR(B → Xsγ). This “focusing effect ” is caused by contributions from: (i) an RG evolution of the Wilson coefficients; (ii) a correction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> chargino contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wilson coefficients, which can considerably reduce <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> gluino contribution. This partial cancellation of the two contributions takes place only in the case of general flavor mixing. As a result, stringent lower bounds on the mass scale of superpartners, which apply in the case of minimal flavor violation, can be substantially reduced for even small departures from the scenario. The often disfavored case of µ ...|$|R
