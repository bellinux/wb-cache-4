5|$|The Hindu Chhinnamasta {{appears as}} a {{significant}} deity in Tantric and Tibetan Buddhism, where she is called Chinnamunda ("she with <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> head") or Trikaya-vajrayogini ("triple-bodied Vajrayogini").

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>severed</b> ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger.

Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} lands in Kuldahar, they {{discover}} {{it has been}} invaded by the Legion of the Chimera.

After the group prevents the attack, the Archdruid tells them that they may reach <b>the</b> <b>Severed</b> Hand through an exit at the bottom floor of the Dragon's Eye. The group travels through Dragon's Eye, and proceeds to <b>the</b> <b>Severed</b> Hand. Once inside, they learn that the war between the Ten Towns and the Legion of the Chimera {{was caused by the}} mayor of Bryn Shander, who had sent Isair and Madae poisoned food. They also discover that a mythal that was cast on <b>the</b> <b>Severed</b> Hand has been corrupted, and the structure will be transported to the plane of limbo. Eventually, the group finds Isair and Madae, and kills them.|$|E

5000|$|Frederick B. <b>Severs</b> (1835-1912) built <b>the</b> 10-story {{hotel in}} {{downtown}} Muskogee {{early in the}} 20th Century. He was a wealthy Muskogean whose house had previously occupied the land where the hotel that was named for him was built. Construction actually began in 1911. [...] Sadly, Severs did not live to see his hotel completed, since he died April 12, 1912. The grand opening was held on August 31, 1912. In October of that year, the renowned actress Sarah Bernhard stayed at <b>the</b> <b>Severs</b> while she performed in a play, [...] "Queen Elizabeth." [...] Muskogee's Rotary Club chapter, chartered in November, 1913, met each Thursday at <b>the</b> <b>Severs.</b> In 1922, an exhibition major league baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers was played at Athletic Park in Muskogee.

5|$|The {{scholars}} Pratapaditya Pal, {{an expert}} on South Asian art and H. Bhattacharya, author of Hinduder Debdebi {{on the subject of}} Hindu deities, equate Chhinnamasta with the concepts of sacrifice and the renewal of creation. Chhinnamasta sacrifices herself, and her blood– drunk by her attendants– nourishes the universe. One invocation to her calls her the sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the recipient of the sacrifice, with <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> head treated as an offering. This paradox signifies the entire sacrificial process, and thus the cycle of creation, dissolution, and re-creation.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} self-decapitation and <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> head is {{recurring}} in Indian mythology. Legends from the Simhasana Dvatrimsika and the Kathasaritsagara speak {{of how the}} hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (jhumjharji or bhomiya) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif {{is not unique to}} Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints of Christianity and in Celtic culture.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{seafaring}} {{people were}} aware of the octopus, as evidenced by certain artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 – 1100 BC) has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology has been thought to have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The Kraken are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant octopus attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 Systema Naturae. A Hawaiian creation myth says that the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe. In this account, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic octopus-like monster from Ainu folklore.|$|E
5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on <b>the</b> <b>severed</b> head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
