The company resells 75 percent of the devices to refurbishers; the rest go to e-waste recyclers who are certified by R2 Solutions or e-Stewards industry standards.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present the notion of mercenaries laid down in {{literature}} and in international law, as its applicability to private military companies and their employees so. The first chapter examines the use of the notion of mercenaries in literature and in international treaties. It explores whether the definition laid down in international treaties, reflect customary international law, or not. The second chapter of <b>the</b> study <b>scrutinizes</b> <b>the</b> various <b>conditions</b> listed in the afore-mentioned notions and tries to find out whether and to what degrees private military companies and their employees meet them. The final conclusion of this paper—of the perspective of international law—is that private military companies and their employees, in accordance with the rules of international law, cannot be considered mercenaries...|$|R
40|$|In three {{different}} variants of an one-shot public good game I analyze {{the relationship between}} cooperation and cognitive abilities, assessed through the cognitive reflection test (CRT). In a between-subjects design, the baseline case is contrasted with two treatment conditions that allow to control for two potentially moderating factors: By employing a test {{for the presence of}} confusion, <b>the</b> first <b>condition</b> <b>scrutinizes</b> whether higher cognitive abilities are correlated with cooperation proper or simply grant {{a better understanding of the}} incentive structure. The second condition explores the proposition that the link between cognitive abilities and cooperation could depend on the complexity of the decision situation. To exogenously create a cognitively more demanding choice setting, subjects had to decide under time pressure. I find a strong and positive relationship between CRT-scores and cooperation, that is not driven by confusion. Time pressure has a strongly moderating effect on this relationship...|$|R
40|$|In cells, an appreciable part of enzymes is {{associated}} with lipid membranes. Academic experimental studies of the function of membrane enzymes (e. g., PLA(2) representing a prototype for interfacial enzymology) are often focused on the enzyme-vesicle interaction or, more specifically, on conversion of lipid forming the external leaflet of the vesicle membrane. The corresponding kinetics are complicated by many factors inherent to the interfacial physics and chemistry. The understanding of the relative role of such factors and how they should be quantitatively described is still limited. Here, we present the mean-field kinetic equations, taking the formation of rafts in the membrane and the product-induced membrane strain into account, and analyze various scenarios of lipid conversion. In particular, we <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> when the kinetics may exhibit a transition from a relatively long latency period to a steady-state regime with fast nearly constant reaction rate. Specifically, we discuss the likely role of the pore formation in the external lipid layer in this transition. The latter effect {{may be caused by}} the product-induced tensile strain in this layer...|$|R
40|$|Using self-consistent {{field theory}} (SCFT), {{morphology}} development in symmetric linear ABC triblock copolymer films on neutral and selective substrates has been studied, {{and it is}} compared with the triblock copolymer morphologies in bulk. In particular, {{the effects of the}} substrate preferable to B (interior) block on nanopattern formation of the copolymer films are of our central interest. Here, we report various nanopatterns with tunable square morphologies. The domain patterns are much more diverse than those parallel to the substrate with substrate selectivity for end-block or those vertical to the substrate without substrate selectivity. Furthermore, in order to figure out an economical and efficient way to fabricate useful passive pattern transfer layers, which have potential applications in microelectronic processes and ultrahigh density storage media, we propose a two-step strategy and <b>scrutinize</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> for generating square symmetries using cylinder-forming or lamella-forming AB diblock copolymers deposited on substrates created from ABC triblock copolymer films. It is found that a thinner film with weak incompatibility can produce square patterns. close 1...|$|R

What should he do? Cis, of course, would be busy--they were all busy about the wedding. He would go and saddle Bolero, and jump him in the park; or should he go down along the river and watch the jays? Both seemed lonely occupations. And he stood in the window--dejected. At the age of five, walking with his nurse, he had been overheard remarking: [...] "Nurse, I want to eat a biscuit--ALL THE WAY I want to eat a biscuit!" [...] and it was still rather so with him perhaps--all the way he wanted to eat a biscuit. He bethought him then of his modelling, and went out to the little empty greenhouse where he kept his masterpieces. They seemed to him now quite horrible--and two of them, the sheep and the turkey, he marked out for summary destruction. The idea occurred to him that he might try and model that hawk escaping with the little rabbit; but when he tried, no nice feeling came, and flinging the things down he went out. He ran along the unweeded path to the tennis ground--lawn tennis was then just coming in. The grass looked very rough. But then, everything about that little manor house was left rather wild and anyhow; why, nobody quite knew, and nobody seemed to mind. He stood there <b>scrutinizing</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> of the ground. A sound of humming came to his ears. He got up on the wall.

40|$|The {{policy to}} improve {{agricultural}} structure which was planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry {{has come into}} operation recently. Considering this development fundamentally, it should be discussed {{whether or not the}} agriculture of Nara Prefecture has the basic conditions on which this project will be developed. Also it should be examined whether or not the agricultural cooperatives which will play important roles on this project particularly through their functions of credit have ability for this purpose. <b>Scrutinizing</b> <b>the</b> real <b>conditions</b> of the agriculture and cooperatives in Nara Prefecture, the following points should be emphasized. 1) In Nara Prefecture, the living standard of the farm families is not low, though the most of the farms are very small in size and part-time. And the farmers are now gradually losing their interests in farming. 2) The most of the agricultural cooperatives are also very small in size and concentrate their effort not in guidance of farming but just in credit activities. 3) Accordingly, {{it is not easy to}} realize the project to improve agricultural structure and the agricultural cooperatives will not be able to play important roles on this project. 4) However, it is necessary to enforce the project which should be made up as to be adapted to the real situation of the agriculture of Nara Prefecture for its modernization. For enforcing this project, the agricultural cooperatives should also improve their structure, for examples, enlargement of their size through affiliation, improvement of credit system, development of guidance of farming and so on...|$|R

While in primary school multilingualism is valued as capital for social inclusion, permitting {{the emergence of a}} temporary, spatio-temporally confined bilingual community of practice (Budach 2009), secondary education emphasizes multilingualism as a form of capital for social mobility and individual distinction, which undermines the conditions for a joint multilingual endeavor.
