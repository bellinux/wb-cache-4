5000|$|Variance on riser {{height and}} tread depth between {{steps on the}} same flight should be very low. Building codes require variances no larger than 0.1875 in between depth of {{adjacent}} treads or the height of adjacent risers; within a flight, the tolerance between the largest and smallest riser or between the largest and smallest tread can not exceed 0.375 in. The reason is that on a continuous flight of stairs, people get used to a regular step and may trip {{if there is a}} step that is different, especially at night. The general rule is that all steps on the same flight must be identical. Hence, stairs are typically custom made to fit the particular floor to floor height and horizontal space available. Special care must be taken on the first and last risers. Stairs must be supported directly by the subfloor. If <b>thick</b> <b>flooring</b> (e.g. <b>thick</b> hardwood planks) are added on top of the subfloor, it will cover part of the first riser, reducing the effective height of the first step. Likewise at the top step, if the top riser simply reaches the subfloor and <b>thick</b> <b>flooring</b> is added, the last rise at the top may be higher than the last riser. The first and last riser heights of the rough stairs are modified to adjust for the addition of the finished floor.|$|R

With {{a new set of}} shape functions and following the displacement-based element procedure, the element stiffness and force vector are derived and nodal displacements are obtained after solving the simultaneous equations; the element stresses are then determined. A wide range of patch tests is conducted to evaluate the consistency and stability of the proposed element. The test results show very good agreement with the exact solutions of the beam theory. Numerical investigations are carried out, showing that the analyses using the proposed elements provide better results than those from the existing methods.

40|$|Regarded as {{a classic}} example of a {{vertically}} differentiated intrusion, the ∼ 300 m thick Palisades sill of New Jersey has a <b>thick</b> <b>floor</b> zone and a thin roof zone and the rocks range in composition from Mg-rich diabase to Fe-rich diorite to granophyre. Differentiation of the sill is proposed to have occurred by two main igneous processes; transfer of crystal mush from the roof {{to the floor of the}} sill in the form of dense plumes and compaction of crystal mush in a thickening cumulate pile. ^ Rocks are pyroxene-phyric in the lower part of the sill, are of near-cotectic composition at the 100 -m level, and are plagioclase-phyric in the upper part of the sill. This change in composition suggests a process of plume transfer of an originally pyroxene-saturated magma. Some neutrally buoyant plagioclase phenocrysts were lost from the earliest descending plumes only to be caught up in later descending plumes to form the plagioclase-rich rocks in the upper part of the sill. ^ Plumes of crystal mush that deposited on the floor generated a thick cumulate pile that underwent compaction, expelling residual liquid upward to form coarse-grained segregation sheets at high levels in the sill. Bent and broken crystals provide physical evidence of compaction of crystal mush, and the degree of compaction is estimated by directly measuring the deformation of the plagioclase-chain network present in the rocks. ^ Cm-scale modal layering observed at the 100 -m level develops in rocks with a near-cotectic composition. Each couplet in the layering is defined as an overlying plagioclase-rich layer and an underlying pyroxene-rich layer. Detailed analysis shows that the modal layers are more complicated than variation in the abundance of pyroxene and plagioclase. Plagioclase-rich layers contain plagioclase crystals that are imbricated and specific types of pyroxene that are present in the pyroxene-rich layers are absent in the plagioclase-rich layers. Modal layering of the type in the Palisades ill is proposed to form from the redistribution of pyroxene in response to compact on along the base of deposited plumes of crystal mush. Pyroxene dissolves and diffuses downward to form a pyroxene-rich layer below and leaving a plagioclase-rich layer above. ...|$|E

40|$|Tijekom lipnja 2011. nastavljena su istraživanja na rimskoj vili smještenoj u uvali Soline otoka Sv. Klement zapadno od grada Hvara (otoka Hvara). Tri sonde istražene su do živca, a kao sastavni dio interdisciplinarnog pristupa istraživanju ove rimske vile izvršena je i arhitektonska analiza novotkrivene arhitekture, analiza statike i stanja vidljivih zidova, te geološki pregled terena. During June of 2011 the {{investigations}} of the Roman villa located in Soline Bay {{on the island of}} St. Clement (Sv. Klement near Hvar) continued in its fifth season. Researchers from four institutions (Hvar Heritage Museum, Institute of Archaeology, University of St. Thomas, Institute of Archaeology at the University of Graz) collaborated on the project, with a number of student and volunteer participants. As part of the interdisciplinary research three probes (4, 5 and 6) were excavated, an architectural analysis of the uncovered structures was conducted and the condition of the standing architecture was analyzed. In addition, a geologist surveyed the site and analyzed mortar from the walls and floors. The location of test probes was based on the data obtained by the magnetometric survey in 2010. The objective was to document and clarify spatial and stratigraphic relationship between different periods of construction in three targeted areas. Probe 4 was an expansion of Probe 2 from 2010, where 17 stratigraphic units were documented. The expected north continuation of wall B was found only in its foundation of late antique construction. There was a segment of a <b>thick</b> <b>floor</b> made of Roman waterproof mortar abutting the wall foundation. An 18 cm-long section of a lead pipe was found inserted in the wall under that floor. The probe was obviously located within a room of the late antique phase of the villa. The expected wall of an earlier phase was not found, only the bedrock. Probe 5 was an expansion of Probe 3 from 2010, located east of the long wall B, where seven stratigraphic units were recorded above the bedrock, but no walls were found. Probe 6 was set up to the west of wall B, where the magnetometry indicated a north-south wall parallel with that wall (c. 12. 5 m apart) and several rooms lined up along that wall. We attempted to uncover one of those rooms. Fourteen stratigraphic units were documented. Probe 6 was the only trench that confirmed the results of the 2010 magnetometry, with the finding of an E-W wall and partial interior of a room. The eastern half of the probe yielded a floor made of chipped stone in lime mortar of an undetermined, perhaps late-antique date. The soil fill below was the first closed deposit found at the site. It contained small pottery fragments dating from the late Hellenistic period and some sherds of Gnathia ware. The western part of the probe was outside the room. Further excavation in this area must continue the next season in order to uncover the entire room and to clarify its function and any phases of construction and transformation. Pottery fragments, mostly small and poorly preserved, predominated among the finds from this season. They could be dated between the late Hellenistic period and Late Antiquity, with a few later fragments. We documented 23 special finds of pottery, metal and glass...|$|E
40|$|The stomach of Decapoda {{varies in}} {{structure}} {{according to their}} habits. The structure of stomach is classified by the trend of evolution of their gastric armature into various patterns ranging from simple structure like in Natantia and Palaemonidae to complex structure like in Brachyura and Anomura. The gastric armature in Penaeus is more developed {{than in any other}} Natantia species. In Penaeus orientalis, the oesophagus can be divided into two characteristic structures: the anterior part consist of the oesophageal lumen with thin chitinous membrane, and its posterior part is composed of calcified chitinous sclerites forming oesophageal plates. Therefore, it is most likely that the particles of fcod masticated by the mandible pass through the lumen but the pulp-shaped nourishment pass through the oesophageal plates. The cardiac stomaches is elongated corresponding to the length of body and it has the following characteristics in mechanism. The dorsal folds lined with chitinous membrane are used for tearing, carrying and pressing the food particles in coordination with the lateral teeth consisting of about twenty seven denticles and the bases of tne cariac plates. The extracted liquid nourishment is filtered and sent by setose cardiac valves into the ventral grooves on the floor of cardiac chamber. However, the filtrate of particles is carried backwared to be placed on about nine molar denticles each bearing a zygocardiac ossicle in connection with the lateral tooth. In this species, the median tooth, lateral molar teeth and cardio-pyloric valves, which are related to gastric armature are more developed than in any other species of Penaeus. The median tooth is well developed. The urocardiac and mesocardiac ossicles which are connected to the median tooth are also well developed. However, since the propyloric ossicle which is responsible for the up-and-down movement of the median tooth is not developed, it workes in a half rotary motion between a pair of molar lateral teeth. During the time of gastric mill, the cardio-pyloric valve raises and closes the cardio-pyloric opening. Finer particles and juice of food materials are swept backward and poured into the ventral chamber of the pyloric stomach by the setae which grow along the grooves on the floor of cardiac chamber. Then, passing through the pyloric plates, they acted on by the digestive juice. But improper materials are pushed upward into the upper pyloric chamber. The pyloric plates are a pair of lateral sclerites lined with stiff and short setae and inserted in-between is the folded median sclerit plate which is covered with thickened longitudinal ridges and each ridge is fringed with stiff upward setae. From histological point of view, pyloric plates consist of a setose chitinous layer, epithelium and median spong like tissues. And the space between epithelium and median tissues is filled with liquid which is suspected to be venous blood. Such a structure can also be seen in the cardiac-pyloric valves and the lateral plates of pyloric chamber. Hard and sharp pices of food which could not be masticated in the cardiac portion are directly forwarded to the mid gut without falling into the hepatic pore. They are acted on by the digestive juice supplied from the intestinal caecum. The tongue-like valve at the junction of the pyloric stomach and the mid gut covers the hepatic pore. The ventral valve located underneath the tongue-like valve controls the digestive juice pouring into the pyloric plates from the hepatic pore. The lateral valves projecting into the mid gut from the lateral plates of pyloric chamber are belived to promote digestion in the mid gut by their motion. The dorsal valve covering the pyloric chamber and the lumen of the mid gut is the chitinous wall between the lumen and the intestinal caecum. The intestinal caecum is likely to secrete the diestive juice and it is lined with conective tissue and a muscle fiber layer. This epithelium layer is profusely fringed with villi, including the radiate projection from the median bulge of the <b>thick</b> <b>floor.</b> The floor layer of this organ is elongated and encloses cylindrically in the mid gut canal. Many valves rising from the outside of this layer into the mid gut are deemed to aid digestion. 胃の構造はその種族が有する摂餌性によって変わるが最も簡単な形態は口脚目であり複雑なものは短尾亜目及び歪尾亜目である. 遊泳亜目の各種はこれらの中間に幅広く分類されているが,部分的にはいづれかの端末型に似てくる. コウライエビは外形的には口脚目に近い形をしているが胃の骨片の構造からすれば短尾亜目に近い特徴を持つている. 1. 食道は前の部分と後の部分では構造が違うが前の部分は食道腔を形成して大きく広がるキチン質の薄い膜からなり後ろの部分は食道内に山形に陥入したかなり厚みのある堅いキチン板からなっている. また,このキチン板の側面には同様に厚く石灰化されたキチン板があって山形の板と接し細い間隙をもつた食道板腔を形成している. したがって大顎で磨砕された食物のうち塊状のものは大顎と上唇との間を通り食道の前方にある食道腔を経て胃噴門部に送くられる. 一方,細かく砕かれたもの及び食物の液汁は大顎と下唇との間を通り食道板腔で一層磨砕され且つ消化液の影響をうけて噴門底溝に送くり込まれる. 2. 噴門部では噴門板,側歯,噴門胃底溝,噴門弁,噴門胃ひだ,中央歯,等が機能に関係している主な機構である. 噴門胃に送くられてきた磨砕物および液汁は直接噴門底溝を流れて幽門部にはいるが塊状の食物は側歯とひだとで引きちぎり後方に送くり込まれる. 後方に送くられる途中で食物は噴門板とひだとで圧せられ液汁がしぼり取られる. この液汁はさらに噴門弁で漉され噴門胃底溝に流し込まれている. 後方に送くられた食物は中央歯と側噴門骨上の歯とで磨砕されるがこの間噴幽門側弁が未砕物の幽門部内への浸入を防いでいる. 3. 幽門部の特徴的構造は幽門板,幽門室側板,幽門部と中腸の結合部における 4 種の弁である. 噴門底溝から送くられた食物の液汁は幽門板の前方にある幽門腹室に流れ込むがその際,噴門部と幽門部との境にある楔状の噴門底突起によってその流入量が調節されている. 幽門室に蓄えられた食物の液汁は幽門板を経由して送くり込まれる消化液によって消化されるが,これに続く幽門板内においても同様で幽門板が動くことによって一層消化を促進している. 一方ここでも消化できない微細な食物塊はこれを幽門室にはね上げ消化が完了した液状部分のみを肝臓開口部を通して肝臓内に送っている. 幽門板は側板と中央板とからなっており食道板と似た形態をとっているが中央板上には櫛状にならんだ茎部がありその先端から上向きに剛毛が生えているのが特徴的である. また,幽門板を横断してみるとその内部には液状物が充たされている空所があるがこの液の充満,減少に応じて幽門板がお互いにすれ合い板上の剛毛は食物塊をはね上げるような運動をしている. また,このような運動のもとになっている液の液腔は噴門胃の下面に集合している静脈と連絡している所から静脈血と関係があろうと想像されるが液の作用は胃に働く力を均等に配分するためのものと思える. 一方,塊状のまま幽門胃に送くり込まれた食物は幽門瓶上部ひだによって幽門室内に保持されているがこれらは幽門室側板によって圧迫し液汁をしぼりとられる. さらに塊状のまま残ったものは中腸部に送り込まれるが肝臓開口部の上を通る際には幽門板中央板の延長である舌状弁によって落下することが防がれている. また,幽門室側板の延長は中腸内に長く伸び側弁となっている. 舌状弁の下には腹弁があって幽門板腔への消化液の注入,肝臓開口部への消化完了液の流出の調節をしている. また幽門胃から中腸にかけてその背面には背面弁があり,この上には腸盲嚢がある. 5 腸盲嚢と称しているものは幽門胃上で肝臓との間に見られる器官であるが背面弁は中腸内に長く細く伸びている. この器管が背面弁と接する面は疎構な結合組織の部厚い層となっているがこの中には洞様血管がはしっている. また,この器官の底部組織は中腸内にまで伸び独特な弁を作っている. さらに幽門部におけるその中央線にそう部分からは外壁に向って放散的に結合組織性の突起を出している. この突起と底面の結合組織との間,および上面の組織との間には絨毛様の管形をした構造物が挿入されている. また,上面の絨毛様の組織は他のものと膜でもって仕切られている. この器官の機能については消化液分泌器官であろうということが予想できる...|$|E
40|$|Since {{suburban}} secondary woodlands such as {{red pine}} (Pinus) forests and deciduous oak (Quercus) forest, or coppice, ceased being utilized for fuel resources, those abandoned woodlands have developed closed canopy and <b>thick</b> <b>floor</b> vegetation (Photo. 1). Accordingly, {{when considering the}} development of recreational possibilities on these sites, {{it is very important}} to prepare suitable forest composition for such use. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the ecological response of floor vegetation under conditions of periodical weeding and changes in degree of light, in order to develop an effective management program for recreation forests. Experimental work was conducted over ten-year period in Pinus forests and Quercus forests in selected districts in the Kansai area, specifically, in Nose, Senboku and Nishigori in Osaka Prefecture, Kameoka in Kyoto Perfecture, Miki in Hyogo Prefecture, and Hashimoto in Wakayama Prefecture. In an atempt to obtain universal validity in the study, the existing recreation forests in selected areas of the Kanto area, Musashi in Saitama Prefecture, Tsukuba in Ibaragi Prefecture, etc., were investigated. The results of study suggest the following principles which can serve to guide the development of forest management programs for various recreational needs and functions (Fig. 25, Table 7). 1. The composition and succession stage of floor vegetation. (1) Composition of the floor vegetation before weeding Regardless of locality or forest type (Pinus or Quercus), such broad-leaved evergreen shrubs as Eurya japonica, Irex crenata and Irex pedunculosa dominated in the floor vegetation (Fig. 1 - 3). Furthermore, since seedlings of Quercus glauca, Neolitsea sericea, etc., as component species of potential natural vegetation, were found growing on the floor, these forest areas are considered to be in progress toward becoming broad-leaved evergreen forest. The light condition on the floor is so dark that not only herbaceous plants are scarce but also wild Rhododendron and other deciduous shrubs were found to be stunted. (2) The succession movements of the floor vegetation One year after weeding, the floor was covered with vegetation which was mainly generated from stumps of shrubs. This kind of vigorous growth hindered herbaceous plants from making normal development (Fig. 4, 5). Six years later, the shrubs had grown so thick that it was extremely difficult to walk through the floor (Photo. 2). At this time, species diversity was the highest since weeding. Three years later, diversity was reduced by half due to the shading of broad-leaved evergreen shrubs. Judging from the above mentioned results, it was concluded that floor vegetation should be weeded at six years rotations in order to maintain rich species diversity in the interests of providing food supply for wild birds and animals. At the very least, floor vegetation should be weeded at ten years rotations in order to avoid succession to broad-leaved evergreen forests. These long term rotations are suitable for floor management when we intend both effects as buffer forests and nursing forests. However, it is important to divide the forest into several zones and to conduct weeding on a staggered basis, that is, weeding one zone one year, another zone the second year, etc., in order to obtain appropriate growth-stages for continuous effect. 2. The results of different frequency and season of weeding on floor vegetation (1) Results in red pine forest in the Kansai area (Fig. 6 - 9) Regardless of whether weeding was done in winter or summer, the reproductive power of woody plants was not reduced by biennial and triennial weeding. Since visibility was interrupted in the case of triennial weeding (Photo. 3), it was considered that we should weed floor vegetation at least at two year rotations when we intend to keep visibility along the strolling trail, but not for walking on the floor (Photo. 4). On the other hand, annual summer weeding reduced floor vegetation to bareness, as was the case with semiannual summer and winter weeding, whereas deciduous shrubs and such high-stem herbage as Miscanthus sinensis and Pteridium aquilinum grew vigorously under annual winter weeding condition. Accordingly, in cases in which the floor is to be utilized resting and strolling, weeding should be done in the spring, but not in summer or winter. Otherwise, it is essential to seed or plant suitable herbaceous species which can endure under summer weeding conditions. (2) Results in Pleioblastus chino var. viridis in the Kansai area This plant often occurs in woodlands or grasslands on hills or mountainsides in the Kansai area, in similar to the case of P. chino in the Kanto area. Since the plant has tall stems and grows vigorously, experimental work was conducted in order to control their stem-height and to form desirable floor of Pleioblastus. Semiannual weeding prevented regrowth of Pleioblastus. Likewise, biennial and triennial weeding led to Pleioblastus being oppressed and shaded by high-growing shrubs, in the case of light condition (Fig. 11, 12). On the other hand, Pleioblastus regenerated well under annual winter weeding. However, the stem was too high for strolling. Furthermore, high-stem herbage also flourished in the case of light condition (Photo. 5). Annual late-spring weeding controlled the height of Pleioblastus to below 30 cm, and the resulting thick regeneration hindered undesirable herbage from invading. Under annual summer weeding, on the other hand, Pleioblastus could not regenerate and high-stem naturalized herbage grew vigorously (Photo. 6). (3) Results in the recreation forests in the Kanto area In the Kanto Plains, in contrast with the Kansai area, not only the topography is flat or gentle, but also the soil is good. Based on a field survey, it became clear that Pleioblastus chino-type floor could be obtained from original abandoned forest floor covered with thick shrubs under annual summer weeding condition, at a stem-height below 25 to 30 cm (photo. 9, Fig. 15). Under conditions of two or three weedings per year, the floor changed into herbage-type just after three years (photo. 10, Fig. 16). The above mentioned results suggest that such conditions as gentle topography and good soil effect the floor vegetation regeneration. Further, an important factor is that since the plain forests adjoin dry farms, various weed seeds can easily reach and germinate in the floor. In the Kansai area, on the other hand, because the majority of farms are paddy fields in which species composition of weeds is different, and slso because the land is more hilly, it is more difficult for weed seeds to reach and germinate in the floor. 3. Condition of flowering of wild Rhododendron Such wild Rhododendron as R. reticulatum, R. kaempferi and R. macrosepalum are frequently seen in abandoned secondary woodlands. However, since the thick forest canopy and shrubs intercept the sunlight, the Rhododendron produce few blooms due to the light shortage (Photo. 12). In order to ascertain desirable conditions for flowering, experimental work and field surveys were conducted (Photo. 13 - 16). The research results suggest that at least 30 % relative light intenstity is necessary for satisfactory flowering of R. reticulatum (Fig. 19), 20 % in the case of R. kaempferi (Photo. 18, Fig. 21), and even 40 % is not adequate light for R. macrosepalum (Photo. 17, Table 4). The flower color becomes more pale under the darker condition, and the number of blooms decreases significantly with only 5 ～ 10 % reduction in the specified light levels. An anatomical survey revealed that the beginning of flower formation occurs between July 1 and July 8 (Fig. 22). Therefore, it is necessary that at least by the beginning of June the appropriate tree stand density must be provided in order to open the canopy. Furthermore, floor shrubs should be removed, except for Rhododendron. This ecological study suggests that abandoned secondary woodlands can be changed into desirable recreation forests by appropriate management as shown in table 7. By utilizing secondary woodlands for recreationl use, we can also conserve important parts of our rural landscape in Japan...|$|E

In addition, it was discovered that the ship was wrecked while carrying cargo that consisted of 26 LT of Kentish ragstone, a type of building stone. With further findings about the area of operation of the ship, Marsden suggested Blackfriars I was used for constructions purposes. The rest of the cargo included: two pottery sherds, a wooden mallet, and a piece of leather. Marsden was able to conclude, using the location and position of the wreck that it crashed into another vessel, a collision which was responsible for the ship sinking.|$|R
