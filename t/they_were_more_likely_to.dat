5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E

5|$|After the Act's initial {{success in}} combating tactics {{designed}} to deny minorities {{access to the}} polls, the Act became predominately used {{as a tool to}} challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.|$|E

50|$|The {{elevated}} power {{individuals will}} experience reduced social inhibition in various ways, one being that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to approach, rather than avoid, another person. Also, with the reduced inhibition {{associated with high}} power individuals, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to initiate physical contact with another person, enter into their personal space, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to indicate interest in intimacy. High power {{people tend to be}} socially disinhibited when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual concepts. Consistent with this expectation, a study working with male and female participants found that when the male and female felt equally powerful they tended to interact socially with one another in a disinhibited manner.|$|R

25|$|After {{researchers}} provoked {{volunteers to}} disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more.

Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour as well as mindless conformity. Disbelief in free will can even cause people to feel less guilt about transgressions against others.|$|E

Religious symbolism is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the Hodegetria and Panagia types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering {{the events of the}} Life of Christ, the Life of the Virgin, parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular saints.

25|$|One {{major source}} of {{controversy}} {{in the realm of}} sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula. LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.|$|E
25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought {{at the time of the}} action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
25|$|A {{worldwide}} 2002 {{study by}} the Norwegian Institute of Nature Research showed that 90% of victims of predatory attacks were {{children under the age}} of 18, especially under the age of 10. In the rare cases where adults were killed, the victims were almost always women. This is consistent with wolf hunting strategies, wherein the weakest and most vulnerable categories of prey are targeted. Aside from their physical inferiority, children were historically more vulnerable to wolves as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> enter forests unattended to pick berries and mushrooms, as well as tend and watch over cattle and sheep on pastures. While these practices have largely died out in Europe, they are still the case in India, where numerous attacks have been recorded in recent decades. Further reason for the vulnerability of children is the fact that some may mistake wolves for dogs and thus approach them.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, a study (2000) {{conducted}} by economic experts Claudia Goldin from Harvard University and Cecilia Rouse from Princeton University shows that when evaluators of applicants {{could see the}} applicant's gender <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, {{the number of women}} hired significantly increased. David Neumark, a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that earnings are higher in high-price restaurants.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on the baby of early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E
25|$|Newborn golden mice {{are fairly}} coordinated at birth; however, {{they have a}} {{tendency}} to remain quietly in one spot. By day 1, they are able to take their first steps and right themselves up easily. Their prehensile tail tendencies become evident by day 2 and by day 4 they exhibit a sense of balance and are able to balance themselves and hang upside down. By day 10, young golden mice display a tendency to crawl upward and by day 15, they are able to jump. Days 17 and 18 are when young mice are seen to become even more active, yet they remain docile when held in a hand. The first attempts at bathing have been observed at day 7 and by day 12, young golden mice attempt to wash behind their ears but they are still relatively unsteady. Between days 12 to 21 newborn golden mice bathe frequently and thoroughly. By day 21, a considerable amount of time was spent outside the nest. Upon birth, if handled every few days once their eyes opened, the mice became more docile and were easily managed through their adult life. If young golden mice were not handled frequently during this period, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be wild and difficult to manage.|$|E

25|$|Current {{research}} that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances {{in two of the}} domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction— the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.|$|E
