5|$|In one of {{his last}} acts as governor, he {{appointed}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. <b>The</b> <b>appointment</b> was made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve <b>the</b> <b>appointment)</b> was scheduled to meet.|$|E
5|$|After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bahá'u'lláh {{named his}} son `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, {{successor}} and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, and <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> was readily accepted by almost all Bahá'ís, since <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant. However, <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> given to `Abdu'l-Bahá was {{a cause of}} jealousy within Bahá'u'lláh's family. Bahá'u'lláh had also stated that another {{one of his sons}} Mírzá Muhammad `Alí was to be subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí, however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí's actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Bahá'ís. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bahá'í community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless of {{continuing}} to pro forma sessions, on January 4, 2012, President Obama appointed Cordray and others as recess appointments. White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler asserted that <b>the</b> <b>appointments</b> were valid, because the pro forma sessions were designed to, [...] "through form, render a constitutional power of the executive obsolete" [...] and that the Senate was {{for all intents and}} purposes recessed. Republicans in the Senate disputed <b>the</b> <b>appointments,</b> with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that Obama had [...] "arrogantly circumvented the American people" [...] with <b>the</b> <b>appointments.</b> It was expected that there would be a legal challenge to <b>the</b> <b>appointments.</b>|$|R

5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as bishop, in February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally have made <b>the</b> <b>appointment,</b> had recently died.

50|$|With the Council {{seemingly}} {{unwilling to}} abolish itself, Rhodes considered alternative means of achieving abolition. In early March, he {{settled on a}} scheme to appoint twenty Councillors {{in addition to the}} eighteen already sitting in the Council. As the Council was presumed to be limited to twenty-one, this would have resulted in seventeen Councillors over and above the presumed constitutional limit. Wary of the constitutionality of <b>the</b> <b>appointments,</b> Lieutenant-Governor James Cranswick Tory wrote of the plan to Secretary of State in Ottawa, stating that he planned to make <b>the</b> <b>appointments</b> on March 15, 1926, unless instructed otherwise by the Governor General. After receiving an opinion from the Law Officers expressing the belief that <b>the</b> <b>appointments</b> in excess of twenty-one would be unconstitutional, the Governor General instructed Lieutenant-Governor Tory not to make <b>the</b> <b>appointments</b> for <b>the</b> time being, and suggested that the matter should be judicially considered.|$|R

5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king.
