25|$|Our propositional {{calculus}} has ten inference rules. These rules {{allow us to}} derive other true formulas given a set of formulas that {{are assumed to be}} true. The first nine simply state that we can infer certain well-formed formulas from other well-formed formulas. The last rule however uses hypothetical reasoning in the sense that in the premise of the rule we temporarily assume an (unproven) hypothesis {{to be part of the}} set of inferred formulas <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can infer a certain other formula. Since the first nine rules don't do this they are usually described as non-hypothetical rules, and the last one as a hypothetical rule.|$|E

He also transacts business in the slave trade. He has many slaves himself, and some he fed to the Rancor, a creature he kept caged and tormented in his dungeon. Jabba uses deception and violence to maintain his position.|$|E

500|$|After {{surviving}} the bombardment, the POWs were resettled in a camp near Munich. The Germans {{gave them the}} opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to obtain treatment; the POWs agreed because it was closer to the American lines. On April 17, American troops secured Nuremberg and subsequently freed the POWs. Juskalian described the event: [...] "When the Germans tried <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were really wounded, the British erected a sign on the gate saying 'Plague', and that kept them out, three or four days later, the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremberg and we were liberated." ...|$|E

That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties {{of one sort or another}} and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it.

500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts {{that had to do with}} really big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E

[...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E

I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E

He stated that it was not something the band would have thought to do and that it worked [...] "tremendously well". The recordings Hayward did only lasted for a few hours and Taylor stated, [...] "we were kind of just left to our own devices <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could make use of it".

2500|$|Frey {{came up with}} a {{cinematic}} {{scenario of}} a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered [...] "a weird world peopled by freaky characters", and became [...] "quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape." [...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie."

[...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E
2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where we are coming from and the older generation <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are moving in the right direction".|$|E
