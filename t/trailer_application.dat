40|$|The {{first part}} of the study is {{centered}} on control design and analysis for nonlinear systems which can be converted to chained-form systems. Solutions to various control problems (open-loop steering, partial or complete state feedback stabilization) are either recalled, generalized, or developped by extending an approach followed by the author in previous papers on mobile robot control. In particular, globally stabilizing time-varying feedbacks are derived and a discussion of their convergence properties is provided. Application to the control of nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots is described {{in the second part of}} the study, by considering the case of a car pulling <b>trailers.</b> This <b>application</b> encompasses simpler unicycle-type and car-like vehicles without trailers. Finally it is shown how slightly modified chained systems can be introduced to derive controls with a broader domain of stability...|$|R

They exhibited the [...] "Container chassis Port 40 multiplex" [...] - a sliding chassis vehicle. They also showed the Euro Trailer Cool, which offers forwarding companies in the refrigerated transport sector {{the advantage of a}} refrigerated body extended by 1.3 m. Kögel offers the optimum <b>trailer</b> for every <b>application</b> with its 2nd generation of the Cargo platform trailer. In addition, they showed a trailer variant as a volume trailer, the [...] "Kögel Mega Centre Axle Trailer“, which is new at Kögel. From the refrigerated vehicle range they presented the revised and extended [...] "Kögel Cool Rail" [...] for rail transport. In the construction sector, where the brand was once present, Kögel now offers the flatbed trailer as a turntable trailer or semi variant. A total of 1,000 orders prove that the products from the traditional brand from southern Germany continue to be in demand.2 ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of Robot-Obstacle interaction computations, {{in the context of}} nonholonomic trajectory deformation for mobile robots. We first recall the principle of the trajectory deformation {{and the role of the}} potential field gradient in the configuration space. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First we show that the potential field gradient can be computed without any closed-form expression of the potential function if this latter depends only on the distance between the robot and the obstacles. Then an algorithm to filter obstacles that have no influence in Robot-Obstacle interactions is presented. This algorithm takes advantage of the spatial coherence of the planned trajectory, and has been evaluated by experiments on mobile robot Hilare 2 towing a <b>trailer.</b> Fig. 1. <b>Application</b> of the trajectory deformation method to the mobile robot Hilare 2 towing a trailer. light dots are obstacles detected by a laser scanner. The robot is at the beginning of the planned trajectory on the left. The trajectory is deformed in such a way that it avoids obstacles, the kinematic constraints keep satisfied and the trajectory starts and end at the same configurations before and after deformation.

40|$|Movers Limited) Tatra 815 VVNC 8 X 8 is a 4 {{axle wheel}} drive vehicle i. e. all the 8 half axles are {{independently}} driven continuously. This chassis is considered suitable for variety of special defence {{projects such as}} 30 m telescopic mobile mast, 15 m mechanical bridge carrying of special radars etc. The standard chassis’s is fitted with 15. 00 x 21, 12 PR(Ply Rating) tires are designed for the carrying superstructure payload(PL) up to 15, 000 kg’s (maximum), and the un-laden weight of chassis’s is about 13, 000 kg. The gross vehicle weight (GVW) inclusive of payload (PL) is 28, 000 kg. The distribution of gross vehicle weight (GVW) {{on the front and}} rear tandem axles is as follows; Front axle weight = 2 x 6, 500 kg Rear axle weight = 2 x 7, 500 kg Gross vehicle weight = 28, 000 kg In one of the special project this chassis being used for towing of 40 tonnes semi- <b>trailer.</b> In this <b>application</b> the distribution of Fifth wheel load (FWL) on the front and rear tandem axle is estimated as under; Front axle weight = 2 x 6, 750 kg Rear axle weight = 2 x 9, 750 kg Gross vehicle weight = 33, 000 kg By comparison of distribution of weights in the above two cases, it is observed that, there are increase load of 500 kg on front axles and 4, 500 kg on rear tandem axles and increase of 5, 000 kg payload on the chassis. Therefore, carrying this paper work we can increase the PL carrying capacity of BEML TATRA VVNC 8 x 8 by 5, 000 kg. This paper is aimed at increasing the payload(PL) carrying capacity of BEML Tatra 815 VVNC 8 x 8 by 5000 kg by incorporating the necessary changes suspension system(Leaf Spring) of the vehicle.
