5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by <b>this</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at <b>this</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> found to be conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important}} to the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. <b>This</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequence}} of <b>this</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> that the thugs win {{and people have}} more incentive to be thugs. There {{are lots of people}} out there who would very much like to get certain kind of material removed, whether religious or political. The more they see others winning, the more they will be likely to do the same. Behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; <b>this</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E

5|$|To {{refrain from}} wearing tefillin: This ruling of the Shulchan Aruch {{is based on}} kabbalah and the Zohar which {{strongly}} advocate refraining from laying tefillin on Chol HaMoed. <b>This</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> maintained by Sephardic Jews and is also {{the opinion of the}} Vilna Gaon whose ruling has been universally accepted in Israel.|$|E
5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. <b>This</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think <b>this</b> <b>position</b> <b>is</b> the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
