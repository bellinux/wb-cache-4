However, high speeds influence spindle dynamics, leading to a reduced accuracy of the SLD prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive method to identify speed-varying <b>tool-tip</b> FRFs and improve chatter prediction. First, FRFs for a screening tool is identified by a novel technique based on a dedicated experimental test and analytical stability solution.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{investigation of the}} influence of <b>tool-tip</b> vibration on surface generation in single point diamond turning (SPDT). Although {{it is well known that}} the relative vibration between the tool and the workpiece plays an important role in the surface generation in single-point diamond turning, most of the prior work has been focused on studying the relative tool-work vibration in the infeed (thrust force) direction while the significant contribution of the effect of the <b>tool-tip</b> vibration in the cutting force direction has been overlooked. In the present study, two characteristic peaks (twin peaks) are identified and found to be corresponding to the <b>tool-tip</b> vibrations by power spectrum density (PSD) analyses. The vibrations possess the features of small amplitude but high frequency. A physical model is proposed to capture the dominant factor based on the characteristic and it reveals that the twin peaks are attributed by the impact between the tool tip and workpiece and the process damping effect. Hence, a geometric model of surface roughness is proposed to take account of <b>tool-tip</b> vibration and it is verified through a series of experiments. The simulation results have been found to agree well with the experimental results. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|High {{frequency}} <b>tool-tip</b> vibration, in {{the cutting}} force direction, is an intrinsic feature of ultra-precision single point diamond turning (SPDT). This paper {{is dedicated to}} {{a study of the}} influence of the <b>tool-tip</b> vibration on surface roughness. The resulting periodic fluctuation of the surface profile is identified in a particular spatial frequency range by a tangential measurement method. The ISO standard provides merely a minimal, not an optimal requirement for surface measurement. Thus, in this paper, a more representative measurement method is proposed to better characterise the machined surface in SPDT. The conventional radial and aerial surface measurements yield a relatively biased result on surface roughness which cannot adequately reflect the detrimental effect of <b>tool-tip</b> vibration. Representative measurement takes account of the sample area ratios and is able to be used to objectively study the discrepancies in surface measurement. The proposed model for surface generation and representative measurement are applicable to the problems in surface generation in ultra-precision SPDT, such as the spiral turning marks and spatial errors in the radial profile measurement.

40|$|Process {{reliability}} and dynamic stability {{is a growing}} customer demand in the metal machining industry. A limiting factor in process stability is regenerative vibrations which may damage the machined component, the cutting tool and even the machine tool. Spindle speed optimization to ensure process stability and enable larger cutting depths {{is based on the}} machine tool and cutting tool assembly's frequency response at the <b>tool-tip.</b> The traditional procedure to retrieve the <b>tool-tip</b> frequency response is to conduct dynamic testing of each machine tool mounted cutting tool. This methodology is normally very time-consuming. In an attempt to reduce testing time, receptance coupling substructure analysis (RCSA) has been proposed by a number of researchers. The objective with this approach is to measure the machine tool structure once and then couple a finite element based substructure representation of the cutting tool of interest. The accuracy of the predicted <b>tool-tip</b> frequency response is then dependent on the quality of measured data.

However, {{it is not always}} feasible to place physical force sensors on the robotic <b>tool-tips</b> due to size or other constraints. Haptic modeling of the organ/tissue could be an alternative approach to provide estimated force information from available data. In this paper, we investigate haptic modeling to provide real-time force estimation in endoscopic surgery. Viscoelastic behavior of the gastrointestinal organ/tissue needs to be taken into consideration. Hence, we proposed a modified haptic model based on commonly-used lumped models, in order to restore the tool-tissue interaction force by using the robot motion.

40|$|This session {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} Java Application Shell (JAS), a Swing-based framework for developing interactive Java applications. Java Application Shell is being developed by Commerce One, Inc. for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Code 588. The purpose of JAS {{is to provide a}} framework for the development of Java applications, providing features that enable the development process to be more efficient, consistent and flexible. Fundamentally, JAS is based upon an architecture where an application is considered a collection of 'plugins'. In turn, a plug-in is a collection of Swing actions defined using XML and packaged in a jar file. Plug-ins may be local to the host platform or remotely-accessible through HTTP. Local and remote plugins are automatically discovered by JAS upon application startup; plugins may also be loaded dynamically without having to re-start the application. Using Extensible Markup Language (XML) to define actions, as opposed to hardcoding them in application logic, allows easier customization of application-specific operations by separating application logic from presentation. Through XML, a developer defines an action that may appear on any number of menus, toolbars, and buttons. Actions maintain and propagate enable/disable states and specify icons, <b>tool-tips,</b> titles, etc. Furthermore, JAS allows actions to be implemented using various scripting languages through the use of IBM's Bean Scripting Framework. Scripted action implementation is seamless to the end-user. In addition to action implementation, scripts may be used for application and unit-level testing. In the case of application-level testing, JAS has hooks to assist a script in simulating end-user input. JAS also provides property and user preference management, JavaHelp, Undo/Redo, Multi-Document Interface, Single-Document Interface, printing, and logging. Finally, Jini technology has also been included into the framework by means of a Jini services browser and the ability to associate services with actions. Several Java technologies have been incorporated into JAS, including Swing, Internal Frames, Java Beans, XML, JavaScript, JavaHelp, and Jini.

We used saccadic reaction times (SRTs) to congruent and incongruent visual (LEDs) and tactile stimuli (vibrations to the index finger of each hand) as an indication of peripersonal space. Participants were trained to hold straight stick tools and press switches with their tips. In Experiment 1 participants used tools with proximal and distal ends delineated by colour i. e. there were no structural differences between ends. SRTs to tool-tips presented adjacent to visual stimuli were attained with tools in the same then in reversed orientation to training (the <b>tool-tip</b> became the end held by the participant). Despite training with a specific tip, reversing the straight tool was not associated with retraction of peripersonal space. These results suggest that tool-use action schemas generalized from the trained orientation to the non-trained orientation. In Experiment 2 participants were trained and tested with straight (uncoloured) tools. Participants then held a re-aligned tool that disambiguated the hemi-space of action (proximal end) from the hemi-space of effect (distal end) by presenting them on different sides of space. In the other hand they held one of the trained tools. SRTs suggested that peripersonal space extension occurred to the hemi-space of expected effect despite no <b>tool-tip</b> in this hemi-space.

40|$|In microsurgery, {{the human}} hand imposes certain {{limitations}} in accurately positioning {{the tip of}} a device such as scalpel. Any errors in the motion of the hand make microsurgical procedures difficult and involuntary motions such as hand tremors can make some procedures significantly difficult to perform.

When a tool is interacting with another object during task execution, several problems arise: a tool can be partially or completely occluded from the robot’s view, it can slip or shift in the robot’s hand- thus, the robot may lose the information about the exact position of the tool in the hand.
