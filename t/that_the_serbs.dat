5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> could take an American hostage.|$|E

Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> saw as devil-inspired treason.

As a result of these reports, the Poglavnik (leader) of the NDH, Ante Pavelić, issued orders threatening that anyone who spread these rumours would be court-martialled. On the eve of the feast day, both the gendarmerie and Ustaše took several hostages in case the rumours were true. Later, the gendarmerie released their hostages, but the 19 hostages held by the Ustaše were killed. In contrast to the actions of the Ustaše, the Home Guard units in the area tried to calm the situation down.|$|E

5|$|Although Višeslav is only {{mentioned}} by name, the DAI mentions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> served the Byzantine Emperor, {{and that they}} were at this time at peace with the Bulgars, their neighbours with whom they shared a common frontier. The Bulgars, under Telerig, planned to colonize Bulgaria with Slavs from the neighbouring Berziti, as the earlier Bulgar expansion had caused massive Slav migrations and depopulation of Bulgaria when, in 762, more than 200,000 people fled to Byzantine territory and were relocated to Asia Minor. The Bulgars were defeated in 774, after Emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) learned of their planned raid. The Bulgars had by 773 cut off the communication route, the Vardar valley, between Serbia and the Byzantines. In 783, a large Slavic uprising took place in the Byzantine Empire, stretching from Macedonia to the Peloponnese, which was subsequently quelled by Byzantine patrikios Staurakios. In Pannonia, to the north of Serbia, Frankish ruler Charlemagne (r. 768–814) started his offensive against the Avars. Dalmatia, at this time, had firm relations with Byzantium. There was a Byzantine–Frankish conflict in the period of 789–810 over Dalmatia, although nothing is known from contemporary sources about the Slavs in the hinterland. When the general Byzantine–Frankish conflict ended in 812, the Franks held the Dalmatian coast while the Byzantines held the Dalmatian cities.|$|E
25|$|After HDZ came to power, they {{conducted}} a purge of Serbs employed in public administration, especially the police.

Whereas, in 1981, they represented 11.5% and in 1991, 12.2% of the total population of Croatia. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier on, which created a perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were guardians of the communist regime.|$|E
25|$|The Army of Republika Srpska was newly established, {{put under}} the command of General Ratko Mladić, in a new phase of the war. Shellings on Sarajevo on 24, 26, 28 and 29 May were {{attributed}} to Mladić by Boutros-Ghali. Civilian casualties of a 27 May shelling of the city led to Western intervention, in the form of sanctions imposed on 30 May through UNSCR 757. That same day Bosnian forces attacked the JNA barracks in the city, which was followed by heavy shelling. On 5 and 6 June the last JNA personnel left the city during heavy street fighting and shelling. The 20 June cease-fire, executed in order for UN takeover of the Sarajevo airport for humanitarian flights, was broken as both sides battled for control of the territory between the city and airport. The airport crisis led to Boutros-Ghali's ultimatum on 26 June, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> stop attacks on the city, allow the UN {{to take control of the}} airport, and place their heavy weapons under UN supervision. Meanwhile, media reported that Bush considered the use of force in Bosnia.

50|$|Croatian Serbs in Knin, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of local Knin police inspector Milan Martić, began to try to gain access to weapons so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Croatian <b>Serbs</b> could mount a successful revolt against the Croatian government.

50|$|Some {{scholars}} argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> ethnonym is antique.

One theory is that it is of ultimately Iranian origin.|$|R
500|$|In 1990 and 1991, Serbs in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina had proclaimed {{a number}} of [...] "Serbian Autonomous Regions" [...] {{with the intent of}} later unifying them to create a Greater Serbia. Serbs used the well {{equipped}} Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in defending these territories. As early as September or October 1990, the JNA had begun arming Bosnian Serbs and organizing them into militias. By March 1991, the JNA had distributed an estimated 51,900 firearms to Serb paramilitaries and 23,298 firearms to Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). The Croatian government began arming Croats in the Herzegovina region in 1991 and in the start of 1992, expecting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> would spread the war into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also helped arm the Bosniak community. From July 1991 to January 1992, the JNA and Serb paramilitaries used Bosnian territory to wage attacks on Croatia.|$|E
500|$|In {{the eyes}} of the clergy, Migration of the Serbs would help legitimize Serb claims to {{religious}} autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary. The official Church narrative held that Leopold had requested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> of Kosovo, Macedonia and the Sandžak settle along the Ottoman–Habsburg frontier to create a buffer against further Ottoman encroachment, and Church officials intended for Jovanović's painting to reflect this view. Hence, the painting had significant political implications. Habsburg Serbs asserted that the agreement between Arsenije and Leopold legitimized their claim to the lands they inhabited. Croatian nationalists decried the Serbs as [...] "uninvited guests" [...] who only acquired Leopold's pledge of autonomy after they had migrated to the Habsburg lands. Migration of the Serbs was thus intended to challenge the historical and political narratives being forwarded by the Croatian and Hungarian painters whose works were also going to be displayed.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the fall}} of the town which Pope Pius II lamentably termed [...] "the gateway to Rascia", Stephen fled to Bosnia with his family and in-laws, seeking refuge at the court of his father. The King of Hungary accused Stephen and his family of selling Smederevo Fortress to the Ottomans [...] "for a great weight of gold", and the Pope at first {{believed}} him. Pius's own investigation appears to {{have come to the conclusion}} that Stephen did not sell the fortress, as the Pope did not repeat the claim. Ottoman, Bosnian and Serbian sources say nothing about the supposed betrayal, so the allegation is unlikely to be based on fact. The Serbian-born janissary Konstantin Mihailović and the Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles maintained Stephen's innocence and pointed out to the strength of the Ottoman army. Both state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> within Smederevo were so unhappy with Bosnian rule and convinced that the Ottomans would prevail (and grant them more religious tolerance than the Hungarians) that they went out to meet Mehmed and presented him with keys to the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} the early medieval Serbian Principality and the Vlastimirović dynasty is {{recorded}} in the work De Administrando Imperio ("On the Governance of the Empire", [...] ), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus ( [...] 913–959). The DAI drew information on the Serbs from, among others, a Serbian source. The work mentions the first Serbian ruler, who is without a name but known conventionally as the [...] "Unknown Archon", who led the Serbs from the north to the Balkans. He received the protection of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), and {{was said to have}} died long before the Bulgar invasion of 680. Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Porphyrogenitus stressed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> had always been under Imperial rule. His account on the first Christianization of the Serbs can be dated to 632–638; this might have been Porphyrogenitus' construction, or may have really taken place, encompassing a limited group of chiefs and then very poorly received by the wider layers of the tribe.|$|E
500|$|The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailović at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. [...] "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," [...] he recounted, [...] "because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović." [...] "The tragedy gave to Nedić convincing proof <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," [...] Djilas wrote, [...] "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans".|$|E
500|$|On 8 November, the Austro-Hungarians {{attacked}} the Serbian 2nd Army near Cer Mountain and came within [...] of the Serbian frontline, entrenching {{themselves at the}} foot of the mountain. The 2nd Army was given orders to hold the Austro-Hungarians down for as long as possible and, if its position became untenable, retreat towards the right bank of the Dobrava River and position itself so as to block the approach to Valjevo. Elsewhere, the Austro-Hungarians drove a wedge between the 1st and 3rd Army and forced another Serbian retreat. Later that day, the Serbian Government held a joint session with the Serbian Supreme Command with regard to Serbia's worsening military position. Putnik stressed that it was critical for Serbia to hold the Kolubara and the towns within its vicinity and suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> make a separate peace with Austria-Hungary if this proved impossible. This notion was rejected by the Prime Minister of Serbia, Nikola Pašić, who urged further resistance to the Austro-Hungarians and threatened the resignation of his government if peace discussions began. The session ended with the Serbian Government and Supreme Command agreeing to fight on.|$|E
50|$|Many Yugoslav and Serbian {{scholars}} put the Šopi (also {{known as}} Šopovi) as a subgroup of <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> ethnos, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group {{is closer to}} Serbs than Bulgarians culturally and linguistically, calling it a Serb population in a foreign (Bulgarian) area, at the Serbo-Bulgarian border.

500|$|While Operation Maslenica was in progress, Croatian forces {{attacked}} Serb positions [...] to the east.

UN forces {{had been present}} at the site since the summer of 1992. They discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> had planted 35 to 37tons of explosives spread over seven different sites on the dam {{in a way that}} prevented the explosives' removal; the charges were left in place. Retreating Serb forces detonated three of explosive charges totaling 5 tons within the [...] high dam in an attempt to cause it to fail and flood the area downstream.

500|$|The {{ease with}} which the HV {{achieved}} victory surprised many observers as Western intelligence services predicted a Croatian defeat. International reactions to Operation Storm quickly evolved from emotive arguments, supportive of either side in the battle, to those calmly assessing {{the situation on the}} ground. UN officials and most international media criticised Croatia. Carl Bildt, an EU negotiator working for the former Yugoslavia, publicly condemned Croatia, while UN Special Representative Stoltenberg urged the UN Secretary General Personal Representative Yasushi Akashi to request NATO strikes against the HV. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed regret but added that [...] "...the years of Serb aggression... have sorely tried Croatia's patience". The US response was mixed. While Secretary of Defense William Perry reflected favourably on the military development, the US ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, declared his disapproval. On 10 August, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 1009 demanding that Croatia halt military operations, condemning the targeting of UN peacekeepers, and calling for the resumption of talksbut not calling for a HV withdrawal. By 18 August, US diplomats on Robert Frasure's team tasked to mediate in the Bosnian War believed Operation Storm lent their diplomatic mission a chance to succeed, reflecting the opinion of US President Bill Clinton <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> would not negotiate seriously unless they sustained major military defeats.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, the regency's army campaigned in Thrace, {{formally}} taking possession of towns secured by popular revolt. With Thessalonica barred against him, his supply lines to Thrace cut, and desertions having reduced his army to 2,000 men, of whom half belonged to Hrelja, Kantakouzenos {{was forced to}} withdraw north to Serbia, where he hoped to secure the aid of Stefan Dušan. Soon after, Hrelja also deserted Kantakouzenos and joined the regency, hoping {{to gain control of}} Melnik for himself. In July 1342, Kantakouzenos met [...] Dušan near Pristina. The Serbian ruler appeared initially reluctant to form an alliance. Nevertheless, under pressure from his nobles, especially the powerful Jovan Oliver, he could not afford to miss this unique opportunity to expand south. Desperately in need of Serbian aid, Kantakouzenos apparently agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> could keep any town they took, despite his own later account to the contrary. According to Nikephoros Gregoras, the Serbs claimed all of Macedonia west of Christopolis (Kavala), except for Thessalonica and its environs. The only concession Kantakouzenos secured was that an exception be made for those towns that surrendered to him in person. To seal the pact, Kantakouzenos' younger son, Manuel, was to be wed to the daughter of Jovan Oliver, although after Dušan later broke the alliance, the marriage did not take place. Hrelja too acceded to the pact, in exchange for the surrender of Melnik by Kantakouzenos' garrison. After Hrelja's death later that year, Melnik was seized by Dušan.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 1991, the {{parliament}} of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo passed a [...] "Memorandum on the Sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina" [...] {{by a simple}} majority. The Memorandum was hotly contested by <b>the</b> Bosnian <b>Serb</b> members of parliament, arguing that Amendment LXX of the Constitution required procedural safeguards and a 2/3 majority for such issues. The Memorandum was debated anyway, leading to a boycott of {{the parliament}} by <b>the</b> Bosnian <b>Serbs,</b> and during <b>the</b> boycott the legislation was passed. <b>The</b> <b>Serb</b> political representatives proclaimed the Assembly of <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 October 1991, declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> people wished to remain in Yugoslavia.

500|$|On 30 May 1990, the new Croatian Parliament {{held its}} first session. President Tuđman {{announced}} his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified {{at the end of}} the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution. In 1991, Croats represented 78.1% and Serbs 12.2% of the total population of Croatia, but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier, which created a perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were guardians of the communist regime. This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia. After the HDZ came to power, many Serbs employed in the public sector, especially the police, were fired and replaced by Croats. This, combined with Tuđman's remarks, i.e. [...] "they declare that my wife is Jewish or Serbian. Luckily for me, she never was either", were distorted by Milošević's media to spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia would be a new [...] "Ustashe state". In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl (who would be the first government leader in the world to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia) accusing the two of plotting [...] "a Fourth Reich".|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians {{fell back}} against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs {{anticipated}} that their opponents would entrench themselves {{and attempt to}} block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were {{in no position to}} block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: [...] "The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning." [...] He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and [...] "huge quantities of war matériel". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: [...] "We could not have imagined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were on our heels, after all we had recently been victorious." [...] On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river.
