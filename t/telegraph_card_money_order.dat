50|$|The {{recall of}} <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{led to more}} than a decade of stagnancy, as there was no {{circulating}} currency. For this reason, in 1730 the government reinstated <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> reaching a total value of 600,000 livres by 1733. Unlike the earlier issues of <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> however, these were printed on plain cards, rather than playing cards. In 1763, after another burst of inflation brought on by a turbulent war-time economy, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was ultimately and permanently withdrawn from the settlement.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{began as}} a {{short-term}} financial device, {{it was not long}} before the cards began to circulate among people as a medium of common exchange and later issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> were provided with this specific aim in mind. Over time, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> became {{an integral part of the}} currency of French Canada and remained in circulation until the fall of Quebec in 1759 (Bank of Canada, 1966, p. 7).|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1685, once {{the first issue of}} <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had been redeemed, Jacques Demeulles wrote of his {{experiment}} in a report to the home government: “No person has refused <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> and so good has been the effect that by this means the troops have lived as usual” (Lester, 1964, p. 11). Upon receiving this report, the King condemned the issue of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> for two reasons; firstly, that so easy a method of raising temporary funds would lead to extravagant expenditure in the colonies, for which he would be responsible when <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was withdrawn from circulation; and secondly, that the cards would be easy to counterfeit. The King’s initial concern would prove to be a considerably greater problem than the latter. However, forgeries of later issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> periodically caused a stir in the colonies, and measures for dealing with those responsible had to be developed (Lester, 1964).|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{continued}} currency shortage, the King of France authorized a new issue of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in 1729. This was used until the fall of New France in 1760. The <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was printed on white cardboard and the size varied by denomination.|$|R
50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in 1717 without a valid replacement left New France in recession (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). In 1722 {{there was an}} attempt to introduce copper coins; however, they were not widely accepted, especially by merchants, and therefore were discontinued (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Finally in 1727, in response {{to the demands of the}} merchants, the king re-issued <b>card</b> <b>money</b> as the official tender of New France (Bank of Canada 2013). This new reissued <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was printed on plain card stock without colors and was marked for value by either cutting or removing the corners from the cards (Marsh 1985). The new <b>card</b> <b>money</b> would be redeemed each year for goods or bills of exchange, which could be redeemed in France (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Unfortunately, the new <b>card</b> <b>money</b> quickly gave rise to the same issues as before, and during the War of the Spanish Succession finances in France went from bad to bankruptcy (Heaton 1928, 655). By 1757, the government of New France had discontinued all payments made in specie and was relying on <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> “ordonnances” (promissory notes from the government) and treasury notes in order to fund operations within the colony (Bank of Canada 1990, 7-8).|$|R
5000|$|Veronique Deblon, {{writing for}} the National Bank of Belgium, notes that all issues of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> [...] "could not be called {{unqualified}} successes", as they were capable of solving budget deficits but eventually were overproduced, leading to inflation. The numismatist Neil Shafer concurs, noting that the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> of Guiana [...] "served its purpose" [...] {{in spite of the}} devaluation. In his article on the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in French Canada, Larry Allen described it as [...] "showing the flexibility, adaptability, and inventiveness of an expanding economic system", despite [...] "seeming ... far-fetched".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1690s, due to {{excessive}} issuance of <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> inflation began to increase perceptibly (Bank of Canada 1990, 6). At {{the beginning of}} the eighteenth century, due to ongoing wars in Europe, the financial aid to the French colonies decreased, meaning that goods were regularly shipped in place of currency. This caused a higher reliance on <b>card</b> <b>money</b> as a form of payment (Heaton 1928, 654). By 1705, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had become official tender and was relied upon to pay building costs as well as soldier’s pay (Heaton 1928, 655). As cards continued to be redeemed at full face value, supply far outweighed the demand and in 1717 it was decided that <b>card</b> <b>money</b> would be redeemed at a 50% discount and withdrawn from circulation (Bank of Canada 1990, 7).|$|R

50|$|Initially, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{was issued}} in three {{different}} denominations, {{in the form of}} singular playing cards bearing the intendant’s arms and signature. It was backed by the private promise of redemption, and readily accepted (Pritchard, 2004). However, due to its widespread monetary use, a significant amount of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> failed to be submitted for reimbursement and remained circulating. This meant that the government was able to increase its expenses (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 8). As a result, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was used as currency in Canada intermittently {{for the remainder of the}} French regime (Pritchard, 2004).|$|R
50|$|As a {{financial}} tool, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{played a significant}} role as a means of exchange. Despite the worries of French officials, colonial authorities were successful in arguing that <b>card</b> <b>money</b> served as {{a financial}} medium in Canada just as coinage did in France (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 9). An economic substitute to the dangerous transfer of specie across the Atlantic, <b>card</b> <b>money</b> allowed France to benefit, since the King did not have the obligation to send coinage to Canada, which would have risked loss “either from the sea or from enemies” (Bank of Canada, 1990, p. 8).|$|R
50|$|A 1758 {{request by}} ordonnateur Vincent de Rochemore, that <b>card</b> <b>money</b> again be issued, went ignored. Some of the Louisiana <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{remained}} extant into the 1760s. However, {{none of the}} several thousand government notes issued {{are known to have}} survived until the present. There are likewise no known surviving examples of Company of the Indies issues.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1730s, again {{faced with a}} {{shortage}} of specie and letters of exchange, the Count of Maurepas recommended applying a <b>card</b> <b>money</b> system, {{similar to the one}} then in use in Canada, in French Louisiana. This was intended for domestic trade, without any mark-up, and to be backed through letters of exchange. On 14 September 1735, the French Crown approved an issue of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> up to 200,000 livres, with a quota of 150,000 livres for letters of exchange. Cards were prepared and signed by the Crown's comptroller in Louisiana, with higher denominations requiring the countersignatures of the governor and ordonnateur. For the next two years the value of the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> remained stable, sustained by ordonnateur Edmé Gatien Salmon's issuance of letters of exchange in excess of the quota. By 1739, however, value of the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> had decreased, as attempts to redeem the cards for letters of exchange went unfilled. The colony was incurring great expenses during their war with the Chickasaw, and - with the French government unwilling to increase the quota for letters of exchange - by 1741 Salmon was already drawing on his quota for 1744. This shortage, and resulting inflation, meant that by 1743 the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was essentially worthless. In 1745, with war still ongoing, the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> and other paper issued by the colony was burned; before liquidization, notes were exchanged for letters of exchange at two fifths of face value.|$|R

50|$|After the British conquest in 1760, French Canadians {{still held}} about 16 million livres worth of paper money, with about 3.8 {{percent of it}} being <b>card</b> <b>money</b> (Marsh 1985). Paper money had become {{essentially}} worthless, with hoarded coin and silver beginning to come back into circulation (Bank of Canada 1990, 9). British merchants eventually began to accept <b>card</b> <b>money</b> {{and other forms of}} paper money at the rate of 80%-85% After three years of discussion, Versailles agreed to reimburse the cards - now mostly in the hands of British merchants - at one fourth of the original value (Heaton 1928, 662). By 1771, France was essentially bankrupt and all <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was deemed worthless (Bank of Canada 1990, 10).|$|R
50|$|The card {{currency}} {{produced in}} Guiana soon outpaced demand, such that inflation became an issue, {{and although the}} cards ostensibly traded at 3 card guilders to 2.50 guilders from the Netherlands, the value began fluctuating greatly. However, the colony's residents continued to use <b>card</b> <b>money,</b> and when Guiana was controlled by the British in the early 19th century, they also produced this money, fearing a deficit. The Dutch regained control of Guiana in 1816, and the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> continued. In 1826, the Dutch colonial government formally introduced paper currency, similar to Dutch banknotes but with the word Suriname overprinted on the bills. The colony's <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was not formally abolished until two years later.|$|R
50|$|During the {{expansion}} of the French colony in New France (in what is now Canada) in the 17th century, currency used had to be imported from France. When the colony faced insolvency owing to great expenses fighting the Iroquois and a diminishing beaver trade, intendant Jacques de Meulles introduced <b>card</b> <b>money</b> to pay soldiers; this soon spread into general use, including commerce. The introduction of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> allowed the colony to reduce deliveries of specie, which could be lost at sea to weather or attack; no specie could be produced locally owing to a lack of precious metals. The currency caught on, and values equal to 100 livres are recorded. Eventually, an estimated two million livres in <b>card</b> <b>money</b> is thought to have circulated.|$|R
50|$|In New France, {{playing cards}} were issued {{as a method}} of payment in the 1680s by the Intendant of New France, in {{addition}} to the coins introduced in the 1660s. However, the massive drain of wealth from New France to Europe resulting from mercantilist trade policies made it impossible to back <b>card</b> <b>money</b> with gold bullion. <b>Card</b> <b>money</b> was thus essentially worthless. The card system collapsed in the 1690s, causing long-term suspicion of paper money {{on the part of the}} French settlers.|$|R
25|$|From 1720 to 1760, {{other forms}} of paper money circulated, {{including}} treasury bills and letters of exchange. These surpassed the amount of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in circulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Card</b> <b>money</b> was {{generally}} issued, at least initially, in emergency situations. It could be backed by other currencies, such as Bills of Exchange, or be without guarantee.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} New France faced {{counterfeiting}} problems with this currency, although counterfeiters could be caned, branded, banished, flogged, or even hanged. It was ultimately inflation, however, which led to the decline of <b>card</b> <b>money</b> in French Canada: the money was produced in a greater quantity than required, in part to offset a failing French economy, while coins were hoarded. Attempts to decrease the value of the cards by half failed, and in 1717 the <b>card</b> <b>money</b> was withdrawn. By 1720 it had been declared worthless.|$|R
