25|$|The {{plan of the}} Chapel holds to the Gothic {{tradition}} of the T form, but the proportions of the interior, the arrangement of bays and buttresses outside, and the carving, are distinctly classical. Perhaps it was difficult owing to the disturbed state {{of the country to}} get carvers outside Oxford; in any case he had to use up old material. For some reason or other, perhaps because it contains swags and Classic capitals, it has been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren. Certainly he was in Oxford in 1656, not being elected to the Gresham Professorship till 1657, but from then onwards {{he spent most of his}} time in London, and probably did not return till his election to the Savilian Professorship in 1661. It is possible that he was interested in the matter, as an amateur: his father had very strong architectural leanings, and may have imbued his son with like interests: but there is absolutely no evidence in support of the theory, nor is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> to show that he had any interest in architecture before his appointment to the post of Assistant Surveyor General in 1662, when the Chapel was practically completed. Beyond details of carving, there is little resemblance to his work, and the building lacks the unity and feeling for proportion and scale which are the chief characteristics of Wren's style.|$|E

[...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} {{size and}} power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The torpedo now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert Fred T. Jane wrote in June 1902,Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, in these days of gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty? ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E

500|$|Rylands v Fletcher {{contained}} {{the principle that}} [...] "the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and, {{if he does not}} do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape", with a requirement that this use of land be [...] "non-natural". On the Cambridge Water Company's third claim, Kennedy was forced to consider the meaning of [...] "non-natural" [...] in this setting. He held that the use of industrial chemicals was not [...] "non-natural", given that it was on an industrial site, and that for a claim to succeed under Rylands the use must be [...] "some special use bringing increased danger to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community"; Eastern Counties Leather created jobs in Sawston, and was thus providing a benefit for the community. As such, the Company's claim under Rylands was not valid. Kennedy also chose to consider foreseeability of harm a factor in cases brought under Rylands, and stated the fact that harm was not foreseeable was a factor in his decision.|$|E

Of them {{it is impossible to}} say which is the more so, though one demonstrates the maximum of naturalness while the other is an exponent of the maximum of training. ... As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but {{this is one of the}} situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what there is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The two Vocal Adrenaline {{performances}} were generally very well received; as noted above, Bell and Chaney used very similar words {{to explain why}} they thought Vocal Adrenaline was [...] "better" [...] than New Directions. [...] "Starships", the first number, was also the more praised of the two: Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that it [...] "stole the show" [...] for him, and was the best musical number of the night. Flandez called it [...] "an electric and sassy delivery" [...] by Unique, and Strecker asked [...] "is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> she can't do" [...] before she gave the performance an [...] "A−". Futterman thought it felt [...] "more subdued than the warp-speed of Minaj's hit" [...] though she added that the [...] "stage acrobatics trump everything anyone else does", and Saskin said it [...] "was fun to watch, but the vocals don't add much to the original version". Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade and praised the [...] "dazzling" [...] choreography of both numbers. [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] was called [...] "turbo-charged from beginning to end" [...] by Flandez, and both Strecker and Slezak gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] grade; the former's enthusiasm was tempered by the arrangement, which was not very [...] "different from just karaoke of the original", and the dancing on the pinball machines as [...] "a bit much for my taste". Futterman said that Unique [...] "riffs the hell out the song", but added that [...] "the robot dancers of Vocal Adrenaline {{make it hard to}} glean any personality from the performance". Dodge wrote, [...] "This one I'm liking even less than the first", but Saskin said, [...] "Mercedes needs to watch out, because Unique sure can belt it out!" ...|$|E
