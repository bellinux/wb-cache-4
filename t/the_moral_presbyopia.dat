This thesis is a comprehensive investigation of Russell Kirk’s doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Imagination. It focuses especially {{on the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Imagination as integrative and non-reductionist, or what Kirk sometimes describes as illative. It explores Kirk’s development of this concept as one through which the individual can grasp his fully human nature and dignity, and which makes use of all the important areas of human social interactions and all the human faculties of knowing, providing man with immersive moral knowledge and support. The thesis is significant for its unique focus on Kirk’s Christian humanist influences – especially T. S. Eliot, Christopher Dawson, G. K. Chesterton, and C. S. Lewis. The aim is to understand Kirk’s attempt to develop the concept of a normative imagination that avoids reductionism in understanding man’s moral life, by presenting a unified vision that neglects no important aspects of man’s life, being, and social interactions. The thesis also aims to explore the norms that Kirk believes it is the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Imagination to apprehend and to structure human life. This contribution is clarified through comparing Kirk’s use of the concept of <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> or normative imagination to recent use of the concept by writers such as Martha Nussbaum and David Bromwich. This thesis also contrasts Kirk’s vision of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Imagination with <b>the</b> kind of sceptical conservatism exemplified in the writings of Michael Oakeshott. The aim of this comparison is to discover whether Kirk’s theory of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> Imagination can overcome the limitations of a conservatism that rejects the role of universal norms and purposes in politics and constructs its conservatism only on the foundation of avoiding rapid and incautious change.

40|$|Kant {{asserts that}} the {{incentive}} which makes humans head for moral act is their feeling of respect for <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>moral</b> law exists a priori as the law of reason and directly determines the will. But it is merely formal and has not any content. Therefore the law itself has not any reference to human feelings. According to Kant, the morality is not grounded on feelings and desires, but rather on negation of them. The morality is grounded on the observance of <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law. Then what motivates the human will to the morality? Kant maintains that <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law determines directly the human will, forming {{the law of the}} will, which prevents feelings and desires from intervening the exercise of the will. It arouses the feeling of displeasure in the human mind, but it realizes <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law, arousing <b>the</b> feeling of respect at the same time. This feeling of respect for <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law is <b>the</b> incentive which makes the will head for <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> act. <b>The</b> feeling of respect for <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law also arouses Interest in the morality in our conducts. And this interest undergoes logical scrutiny through the maxim of conduct, breeding consciousness as to whether the maxim applies universally or not. That is to say, the interest provides a way in which <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> law realizes itself in actual condusts. Kant calls this series of the movements of mind the true 'Moral Sentiment'. ...|$|R

The singularized norm is opposed, from experience, by its negation in individual cases. To assume Kant demands the reconciliation of the singular, manifested incases, with the universal.
