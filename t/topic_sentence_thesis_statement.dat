40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 51 - 55). This thesis is concerned with teaching organization of essays and paragraphs in writing at tertiary level universities in Dhaka. It tries to assess {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of teaching writing with a view to suggesting improvements. This research will be helpful for future researchers to have an understanding about teaching organization in writing. Our students' level of English proficiency in writing at tertiary level is not adequate at all. One of the major reasons for this may be ineffective teaching. It is, therefore, significant to examine the effectiveness of teaching writing in the light of the recent theoretical developments in the field. The objectives of the study are to examine the teaching strategies for: (a) <b>topic</b> <b>sentence,</b> (b) <b>thesis</b> <b>statement,</b> (c) introduction and conclusion, (d) unity and coherence, (e) linking devices. For this study semi-structured interview is used. The results show that the teaching strategies are effective too some extent, but the study found few problems associated with teaching writing.

40|$|Narratives {{have emerged}} {{in the area of}} second {{language}} (L 2) writing and have played a key role as a proper research method. Reflective narratives have identified significant benefits by analyzing the writer’s experiences and insider perspectives in depth. Furthermore, stories shared by writers have validity in enriching their understanding further about personal realities and unraveling interpretive accounts with a critical eye. However, few studies demonstrate the findings of writing problems that students encounter and offer suggestions for teaching writing based on students’ experiences and practices of writing in English utilizing their detailed reflective narratives, especially in EFL contexts. This study focuses mainly on broadening possibilities for writing approaches suitable for teaching contexts as teacher development. The data analysis employed the categorization of 15 Japanese EFL undergraduates’ reflective narratives in three phases: the careful reading of all sentences in their reflective accounts of writing in English, the development of a temporary coding system, and the evaluation of the reliability of the coding system. The research findings show that the participants referred to the further importance of written structures (e. g., <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and <b>thesis</b> <b>statements),</b> reader awareness for English writing at the university level, and joint work in the writing classroom. Suggestions for teaching writing are discussed in conforming to the findings of the students’ reflective narratives...|$|R
40|$|Good {{composition}} {{is the one}} which creates clear impression of unity (Vivian and Jackson, 1961 : 32). In addition, a good composition must be unified on two levels. First, it must have an overall unity that means each paragraph of the composition must {{be related to the}} <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> as the central idea which is stated in the introductory paragraph. Second, the individual support paragraphs (paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and so on) must also exhibit internal unity. It means that the supporting sentences of each paragraph must be related to its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> This study is intended to reveal how far the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala Catholic University can apply their knowledge in writing unified compositions. As they learn descriptive writing, the writer analyzes the unity as encountered in their descriptive compositions. The analysis covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To carry out this study, the writer took the third semester English Department students of Widya Mandala University as the subjects of this study. The data were taken from their final test papers. As stated previously, the analysis of the data covered the analysis of unity in the paragraph and unity in the whole composition. To analyze the unity in the paragraph, the writer identified the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> of each paragraph and evaluated the relationship between the supporting <b>sentences</b> and its <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> while to analyze the unity in the whole composition, the writer identified the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> of each composition and evaluated the relationship between each <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and its <b>thesis</b> <b>statement.</b> The analysis of unity in the paragraph showed that most paragraphs under study were disunified while the rest were unified. There were two factors that violated the unity in those paragraphs. They are the presence of more than one <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and the irrelevant relationship between some supporting <b>sentences</b> and the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence.</b> In addition, the analysis of the unity in the whole composition showed that all compositions under study were disunified. There were also some factors that made all compositions under study disunified. They are the absence of <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> as the central idea of the composition, the disunity in one or some or all paragraphs of the compositions, and finally, the irrelevant relationship between one or two <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement.</b> Based on these findings, it can be concluded that all students under study still found difficulties in creating unity in their compositions especially in writing composition with one <b>thesis</b> <b>statement,</b> in making all paragraphs of the composition unfied, and developing the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> in several paragraphs which support the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> itself. Concerning the result of this study, it is suggested that the teachers should train the students in forming <b>thesis</b> <b>statements</b> as the central idea of a composition as well as elaborate it into several <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> by making an outline of a composition. It is also suggested that the teachers should keep training the students to create unity in the paragraph since one or two or all paragraphs are disunfied in all students’ compositions under study...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of a good composition is coherence. It is important for a writer to make use of this characteristic in putting ideas on paper since it helps a writer to organize his/her ideas as clearly as possible so that the readers will not find it too difficult to understand what he has written. This study investigated the expository composition coherence of the fifth semester students of the English Department of Widya Mandala University with the intension to describe the coherence quality between (a) the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> and the <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> of each essay, and (b) how the transitional words/phrases are used. To achieve these objectives, the writer asked 21 students to write an expository composition about "The Reasons of the Clothing Regulation Issued by the English Department of Widya Mandala Catholic University". The population of this study was the fifth semester students who took Writing IV at the English Department of Widya Mandala. After the data were collected, the writer analyzed them in terms of the <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> and <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> relationship, <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> and supporting sentences relationship and the use of transitional words/ phrases.

Through studying <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in Chinese students’ English essays, this research aims to find out the frequency and the placement of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences,</b> the wording within <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the relationship between <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and paragraph unity. In this research, 45 English essays written by Chinese students were collected from WECCL corpus and targeted <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> were selected out afterwards. Depending on Wordsmith 3. 0, results related to <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> were generated including the frequency, the placement, the wording of <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and the unity between <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and supporting sentences. Results show that Chinese students have a good awareness of writing <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> and placing them at the beginning of paragraphs. However, Chinese students are not good at applying transitional phrases and expressing ideas objectively as academic writing requires. Moreover, paragraph unity in some Chinese students’ essays is poor. In addition, as a part of this empirical study, an interview about how to write <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> was conducted among ten Chinese students majoring in English in order to verify the results. Based on the responses from the interview and previous research, this research suggests that Chinese rhetoric convention and school instruction on writing are two major factors leading to the present results...|$|R
30|$|Whether {{holistic}} rating or analytic {{rating scales}} are used, {{in the assessment}} of writing the organization of ideas (sometimes called essay structure) is invariably taken into account. Likewise, in evaluation of writing by classroom teachers organization of ideas is often highly valued. However, the concept of organization is very broad (Cummings et al. 2001; Freedman, 1979). What constitutes effective organization seems to vary widely between teachers, institutions and geographical areas. There are many different rhetorical features that can be taken into account. Some in the field of language education may look for the presence of <b>thesis</b> <b>statements</b> and <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> (MacIntyre, 2007), while others may focus more on paragraphing, cohesive devices or coherence (Erdosy, 2004), for example.|$|R

Addressing these limitations, the current study examined the presence or absence and placement of <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> and <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> in four sets of argumentative texts produced by three groups of university students.

40|$|It {{has been}} more than thirty years since Richard Braddock {{published}} the notable article in which he examined the manner that professional writers utilize <b>topic</b> <b>sentences.</b> He found in his corpus that expository paragraphs seldom began with <b>topic</b> <b>sentences.</b> Consequently, Braddock (1974) admonished teachers to stop instructing their students that most professional writers begin their paragraphs with <b>topic</b> <b>sentences.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to replicate Braddock’s study using a corpus made up of articles selected from a particular area of written discourse, American history. Braddock’s model, with a few exceptions, is used in the evaluation of this material. Braddock’s conclusion, that only 13 % of expository paragraphs begin with a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence,</b> has been widely cited to support the notion that teachers need to reassess the manner in which they teach reading and writing skills.

50|$|Also {{known as}} a focus sentence, it encapsulates or organizes an entire paragraph. Although <b>topic</b> <b>sentences</b> may appear {{anywhere}} in a paragraph, in academic essays they often appear at the beginning.The <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> acts {{as a kind of}} summary, and offers the reader an insightful view of the writer’s main ideas for the following paragraph. More than just being a mere summary, however, a <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> often provides a claim or an insight directly or indirectly related to the thesis. It adds cohesion to a paper and helps organize ideas both within the paragraph and the whole body of work at large. As the <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> encapsulates the idea of the paragraph, serving as a sub-thesis, it remains general enough to cover the support given in the body paragraph while being more direct than the thesis of the paper.|$|R

40|$|Every good {{piece of}} writing has a main point, a main idea, or a central message. The {{argument}} you make in your paper should reflect this main idea. The sentence that captures your position on this main idea {{is what we call}} a <b>thesis</b> <b>statement.</b> A <b>thesis</b> <b>statement,</b> then, is a sentence located in the introduction of your paper that expresses your main point. Your <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> should be evident in your introduction, and it should be as clear and specific as possible. A good <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> has several basic features. It fits the size of the assignment. It states a single main point or position about the topic. It is specific. It is something you can show, explain, or prove. One way to write a <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> is to use this basic formula as a start: Narrowed topic + Author’s main point/position = <b>Thesis</b> <b>statement</b> Listening carefully can help you avoid a whole range of problems. Further points and examples A <b>thesis</b> <b>statement</b> is an assertion, not a statement of fact or an observation. Fact or observation: People use many lawn chemicals. Thesis: People are poisoning the environment with chemicals merely to keep their lawns clean. A thesis takes a stand rather than announcing a subject. Announcement: The thesis of this paper is the difficulty of solving our environmental problems. Thesis: Solving our environmental problems is more difficult than many environmentalists believe.

Children were trained to find the main idea in one-and two-paragraph texts and took pre- and posttests in which they were asked to write the main ideas contained in one-, and six- to eight-paragraph texts. The main ideas contained in these texts either were explicitly stated (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> first or last) or were implicit (<b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> missing). Children's performance improved from pre- to posttest, although the effect of <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement was evident at both test times (performance on topic-sentence-first paragraphs was better than on topic-sentence-last paragraphs, which was, in turn, better than performance on topic-sentence-missing paragraphs). Although average achieving children and {{children with learning disabilities}} did not differ on static pre- and posttest measures, they did dif-fer in how easily they learned to find the main idea under different <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> placement conditions.

Two groups {{of the first year}} students of English Department at Jambi University in Indonesia were selected as participants in this study. Each group consists of 30 students. Group I was required to perform the writing task that is provided <b>topic</b> <b>sentence</b> (PTS). Group II was required to perform the writing task that is provided signal words (PSW). The results of the test were rated or scored by using analytical and holistic rating systems. The data were analyzed statistically by using Independent Sample T – Test and Correlation. The findings of the study showed that on average, Group I has higher level of effect on student’s writing proficiency (M = 72. 57, SE = 1. 81) than the effect of Group II on student’s writing proficiency (M = 56. 50, SE = 2. 16). This difference is significant (t (58) = 5. 70; p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the interactions among the components of complexity have strong correlation. Then, positive relationships among the components of coherence are also statistically proved. Therefore, the null hypothesis which says that there is no effect of different task variance that involves Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> and Providing Signal Words on student’s writing proficiency which covers complexity and coherence can be rejected. Based on these findings we conclude that Providing <b>Topic</b> <b>Sentence</b> helps students much better to develop paragraph writing than Providing Signal Words. ...|$|R
