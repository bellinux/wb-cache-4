5|$|Australia's captain Woodfull {{refused to}} retaliate and England made 524 in reply, McCabe having Jardine caught behind for 27 {{to end with}} 1/42. McCabe {{was one of the}} few Australians <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> impact in the second innings, making 32 as Australia fell for 164.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|By October 1906, Charles Parham {{was invited}} to speak {{for a series of}} {{meetings}} at Azusa Street but was quickly un-invited. Parham had personality conflicts with Seymour and wanted to be the chief authority figure of the movement that was taking place, but the presiding leaders of the Apostolic Faith Mission were slow <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> changes to their methods or leadership.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which had been unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E

Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. Suryakantam {{was chosen to}} play Gundamma and Chakrapani suggested Kameswara Rao not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> special efforts to make her character look ruthless because Suryakantam had an aggressive body language.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April {{the second}} raid across the Jordan began, their {{objective}} to capture Es Salt. This time {{a much larger}} force was involved under command of the Desert Mounted Corps. The regiment and brigade {{were part of the}} force assigned to attack Shunet Nimrin. Once again they advanced through Turkish artillery fire, and confronted by Turkish strong points in the foothills, were unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> progress. That night they moved back across the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least {{authority}} to any person <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E

5|$|The Character Creation {{section of}} the game was refined to take less time than Fallout 3, with players able to skip the {{tutorials}} and proceed across the Wasteland once their character is set up.

5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar but failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was {{barely able to}} enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Law on the National Flag {{mentions}} five possible sizes {{that could}} be made for the national flag: According to Article 4 of the Law On the National Flag, people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> copy of the national flag. Besides five official sizes for flying on flagpoles, there are another four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E

5|$|The {{appellant}} further highlighted {{that section}} 6 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act ("RSIA"), which was enacted shortly after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, provides that Part IV of the Constitution of Malaysia ceased to have effect in Singapore. Since Part IV contains Article 73(a) – the extraterritoriality clause – the appellant argued that its exclusion meant that Singapore's Parliament was not empowered <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> law which had extraterritorial effect.|$|E

5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> evasive manoeuvres. And {{all they had}} was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track was needed to connect the line into the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
