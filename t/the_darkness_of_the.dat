5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which in <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven {{remaining}} boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier {{who was about to}} bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{description}} {{based on the}} work of Leszek Podhorecki, although the Poles were more aware that the battle was about to take place, the forces encountered one another in <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, and Żółkiewski decided to organize his army rather than engaging immediately, which also gave the Tsardom of Russia time to prepare. According to Mirosław Nagielski, however, the Poles under Żółkiewski purposefully chose to engage the opponent at that time, hoping to catch them asleep.|$|E
50|$|Art {{historian}} Anthony Blunt linked {{this work}} to Blake's Nativity and Procession to Calvary, and contended {{that they provide}} insight to Blake's mindset at the time. The artist had earlier been preoccupied with <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> evil and <b>the</b> duality <b>of</b> human nature, but seemingly emerged and found hope through <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> salvation through Christ. According to Blunt, Blake conveys this through <b>the</b> motif <b>of</b> a bright light shining into <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> mankind. In <b>the</b> present work this is perhaps expressed through the angel appearing in brilliantly illuminated colours from <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and foreboding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees.|$|R

An elusive subspecies of the Australian masked owl unique to the Nullarbor is known to roost in the many caves on the plain. The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits.|$|E

The municipal authorities of the state were also asked to maintain coordination and work in unison with the Federal government. The Mexican authorities then asked the population to stay calm, since the massacre took place in a remote area and in <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early morning. In addition, SEGOB emphasised that as for the Monterrey casino attack and the San Fernando massacre, justice would be served.|$|E

25|$|The British frigates {{left the}} battle at 4 pm, and {{although}} after consulting among themselves the British commanders resolved return to fight at 4:30 pm, they finally withdrew {{half an hour}} later. The imminence of the nightfall {{and the possibility of}} running aground on the coast between Huelva and Ayamonte convinced Alonso de Torres y Guerra to turn back to Cádiz instead of chasing Galloway's division, but trying before to sail between the retreating British ships to shoot upon them two complete broadsides. The British vessels, however, managed to avoid the action by taking advantage of its fasteness and <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dusk.|$|E
25|$|P. exigua are small, swarm {{founding}} wasps. One {{can determine}} the wasps’ age by evaluating <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuticle on the apical edge of the fifth gastral sternite. Older wasps typically exhibit darker shades relative to others in its colony. The front wing length is generally 4.15mm, and their wings are more rounded than other wasps. This round wing shape may enhance the wasp species’ flying abilities and increase fitness. The muscle mass on P. exigua’s mesosoma directly contributes to flight power; the larger the muscle, the stronger the output. Instead of flapping their wings, P. exigua row them due to increased wing drag. Mature P. exigua eggs have a complete chorion and are tinted blue with a shiny coat. Immature oocytes that are equal in size to mature eggs can be distinguished due to their cream and less glossy appearance.|$|E
