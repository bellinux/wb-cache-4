5|$|Hoping to {{capitalise}} on the spontaneous uprising that spread across Ireland in May 1798, Commodore Daniel Savary led a third, and more successful, effort. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> frigate squadron flying false British colours to Killala, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under General Humbert. A larger force {{would have been}} despatched, but the French had been caught unprepared—the Irish rebellion had originally been planned to coincide with a later French landing, but British intelligence operations had infiltrated the United Irishmen and arrested much of its leadership, prompting a precipitate revolt. Although the uprising achieved some early successes, by the time Humbert arrived its outcome had already been decided with the defeat of successive rebel armies by British troops. Humbert's force was joined by many United Irishmen and had some initial success, {{but was unable to}} face superior British numbers at the Battle of Ballinamuck, and surrendered on 8 September. Although its small size allowed it to reach Ireland unobserved, neither Savary's frigate squadron nor the army it carried were large enough to {{have a significant impact on}} the campaign.|$|E

She {{was named to}} the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the all-around title. However, because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began, she was only able to compete on one event, the uneven bars. In spite of her injury, in the qualification round, Liukin's bars set earned a 16.2, the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet. Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars, where she <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> step on her dismount and finished with a 16.05, earning a silver medal behind Britain's Beth Tweddle.|$|E

The party returned with tales of dozens of strange Indians occupying the town, and began to assemble a more substantial force. Col.

On the morning of December 14, 1763, just before dawn, fifty armed and mounted Paxton Boys descended upon Conestoga Town, killed the six Indians they found there, and burned the town. While the Susquehannocks were probably in communication with hostile Indians on the frontier, {{the results of the}} Rangers' attack are hardly consonant with their supposed justification of harboring numerous hostile Indians.|$|E
