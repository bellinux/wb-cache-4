His first and only elected office, he served in the Senate from 1875 to 1905, when he retired.

5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the {{relatively}} mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted {{a seat on the}} influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed <b>the</b> <b>Chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board of directors.|$|E
50|$|Four {{incumbent}} Republicans were {{challenged in}} primaries that centered around Gov. McDonnell's controversial transportation funding overhaul that imposed a $1.2 {{billion per year}} tax increase. 34 House Republicans voted for the bill, causing an uproar amongst conservatives. No sitting Republican delegate had faced a primary challenge since 2005. In the June 11, 2013 primary, two veteran Republicans who supported the transportation plan were defeated: businessman Dave LaRock beat 33rd District Del. Joe T. May 57%-43%, and physician Mark Berg ousted 29th District Del. Beverly Sherwood by a 51%-49% margin. Both May and Sherwood held committee chairmanships; their ouster opens <b>the</b> <b>chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transportation Committee (chaired by May) and the Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee (chaired by Sherwood). House Speaker Bill Howell and Del. Bobby Orrock handily defeated their primary challengers.|$|R

50|$|Except for {{the second}} and third {{committee}}, all committee chairmen were elected on 10 April.

5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a {{majority}} was a minimum of 12, {{but in fact the}} number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights for African Americans. Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|Bethard was <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Annie Shirley Edgerton (1897-1977), a Coushatta native, and the {{attorney}} Henry W. Bethard, Jr. (1898-1961), originally from Harrisonburg in Catahoula Parish in eastern Louisiana. A graduate of Loyola University New Orleans School of Law, Bethard, Jr., established his law practice in Coushatta in 1922. Bethard joined his father's firm in 1948, upon receipt of his Juris Doctor degree from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. Among his civic roles were <b>the</b> <b>chairmanships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank <b>of</b> Coushatta and <b>the</b> commissioner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana State Library, the latter position filled from 1947 to 1951.

5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by the lieutenant governor are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to the lieutenant governor were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, the lieutenant governor controls many patronage positions and is permitted to fill them by appointment.

5|$|Harrison was {{admitted}} to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896. He then joined the Southern Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer, becoming an assistant to the company's president in 1903. He served as vice-president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906. During the Panic of 1907, Harrison successfully persuaded J. P. Morgan to purchase bonds in the Southern to keep the company solvent. After the panic had subsided, Harrison was named president of the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway, later the Monon Railroad (succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn's death), which was jointly owned by Southern and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. William Finley, president of the Southern Railway, died on November 23, 1913, and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later. Besides <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Railway, he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads. His election was considered to be a sign of change in the Southern United States, especially in its railroads, both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 1773 he {{received}} the office of Great Clerk (Writer) of Lithuania, a relatively low-ranked position that was seen by some as below the magnates of the Potocki family. He participated in the Partition Sejm of 1773, where he sat on several commissions. Seeing himself {{in opposition to the}} king, he refused a seat on the Permanent Council that he was offered in March 1774. The king tried to appease him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 14 July that year, but that failed to bring Potocki to his side. Instead, Potocki became, for the next decade and half, one of his chief political critics and opponents; on 1776 he went to Moscow to argue, unsuccessfully, for limiting the power of king and the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. Later that year, his election to the Sejm was disputed, and the king and Stackelberg managed to block his election. In 1778 however, the growing rift between the king and Stackelberg allowed him to take, through political maneuvering, <b>the</b> <b>chairmanship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Permanent Council Marshal of the Sejm. That year he also became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle.|$|E

50|$|Article 148 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{constitution}} {{stipulates that}} the prime minister shall act as <b>the</b> representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet as a whole, delegate its agendas, coordinate <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> ministers, ensure <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> policy adopted by the cabinet, and issue regulations.
