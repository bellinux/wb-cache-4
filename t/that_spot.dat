5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at <b>that</b> <b>spot,</b> which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on <b>that</b> <b>spot</b> than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years it is necessary to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at <b>that</b> <b>spot</b> for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from <b>that</b> <b>spot</b> (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit footwear. The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit footwear in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from <b>that</b> <b>spot</b> and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E

5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at <b>that</b> <b>spot.</b> Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E
5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks {{instead of the usual}} 36, with the top 20 trucks in the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 trucks in the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top four in a last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if <b>that</b> <b>spot</b> is vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ would qualify for the main event.|$|E

25|$|Spot42 can {{interact}} directly with mRNA targets through base pairing. The first Spot 42 target {{was discovered by}} Møller et al. who showed <b>that</b> <b>Spot</b> 42 specifically binds to a short complementary region at the translation initiation region of galK (encodes a galactoinase). galK is the third gene in the galactose operon, which contains four genes (galETKM) and produces a polycistronic mRNA. Spot 42 mediates discoordinate expression of the gal operon (i.e., the individual genes in the operon are not similarly expressed) by binding to the galK Shine-Dalgarno region, thereby blocking ribosome binding and translation of the galK gene. The physiological significance of the coordinate expression is unclear, but suggests <b>that</b> <b>Spot</b> 42 {{plays a role in}} fine-tuning gene expression to optimize the utilization of carbon sources.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the killing}} and the {{settlement}} under tribal customs, the Indian agent had Crow Dog arrested {{and taken to}} Fort Niobrara, Nebraska. Within 20days, the U.S. Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior concluded that the Federal Enclave Act of 1854 as modified by the Assimilative Crimes Act allowed the territorial death penalty {{to be applied to}} Crow Dog. [...] In September 1881, Crow Dog was indicted by a federal grand jury for murder and manslaughter under the laws of the Dakota Territory. In March 1882 the case was heard by Judge Gideon C. Moody at the First Judicial District Court of Dakota, located in Deadwood, South Dakota. The court appointed A. J. Plowman to represent Crow Dog, who claimed that he had been punished and made reparations according to the customs of the Brulé Sioux tribe. According to a contemporary news report of the Deadwood Times {{it was the first time}} [...] "in the history of the country, [...] an Indian is held for trial for the murder of another Indian." [...] The trial was viewed at the time as a sham, and despite testimonies from Indian witnesses stating <b>that</b> <b>Spotted</b> Tail had killed a rival once before, <b>that</b> <b>Spotted</b> Tail drew a pistol on Crow Dog, and <b>that</b> <b>Spotted</b> Tail's intention was to kill Crow Dog, [...] Crow Dog was convicted and sentenced to be hanged on May 11, 1882. [...] The prosecution had presented five Indian witnesses who stated <b>that</b> <b>Spotted</b> Tail was ambushed, and some witnesses stated he was unarmed. In an unusual move for a death penalty case, Moody released Crow Dog, allowing him to go home pending his appeal to the territorial Supreme Court. Surprising many of the white citizens of the area, Crow Dog returned to court as required. In May 1882, the territorial Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, and the execution was rescheduled for May 11, 1883. [...] Crow Dog then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus and the Supreme Court accepted the case.|$|R
