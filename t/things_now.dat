5|$|By then, the {{situation}} in the Holy Land was a precarious one. Jerusalem had fallen in 1244, and Acre was now the centre of the Christian state. The Muslim states were on the offensive under the Mamluk leadership of Baibars, and were now threatening Acre itself. Though Edward's men were an important addition to the garrison, they stood little chance against Baibars' superior forces, and an initial raid at nearby St Georges-de-Lebeyne in June was largely futile. An embassy to the Ilkhan Abaqa (1234–1282) of the Mongols helped bring about an attack on Aleppo in the north, which helped to distract Baibars' forces. In November, Edward led a raid on Qaqun, which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem, but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed. <b>Things</b> <b>now</b> seemed increasingly desperate, and in May 1272Hugh III of Cyprus, who was the nominal king of Jerusalem, signed a ten-year truce with Baibars. Edward was initially defiant, but an attack by a Muslim assassin in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning. Although he managed to kill the assassin, he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned, and became severely weakened over the following months.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of <b>things</b> <b>now.</b> While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and {{on the basis of these}} details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E

[...] "The way we do <b>things</b> <b>now</b> is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E

500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} {{that he had been}} thinking about [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with <b>things</b> <b>now</b> and I—said what I wanted to say. I have a friend who says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E
500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the <b>things</b> <b>now</b> that people used to do that they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, self-driving cars coming right around the corner ... My thought was, 'What would happen if ... music [...] all artificial?’” ...|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the <b>things</b> <b>now</b> {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came out of my mouth.

2500|$|Schoolboy Q had {{initially}} announced guest appearances {{on the album}} to include Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, ASAP Rocky, Danny Brown, and Action Bronson, while the production would be handled by in-house producers from Top Dawg Entertainment, such as Digi+Phonics members Sounwave and Tae Beast. In December 2012, Schoolboy Q revealed his collaboration with fellow American rapper Danny Brown, to be titled [...] "Eat." [...] However Schoolboy Q later revealed the song would not appear on the album. In a February 2013 interview, Schoolboy Q said he was [...] "like four records away from being done". During the same interview he claimed {{the making of the}} album was [...] "stressful and fun at the same time". He also stated there was a point in the recording process where he was stuck because he [...] "couldn't find the right beats." [...] In March 2013, he would later say: [...] "I stopped recording for about two months to gather my thoughts and see how I was gonna attack the album. At first I was going a little too party. Then I started going too story. I was almost trying to make an album like Kendrick's. You try so many <b>things.</b> <b>Now,</b> I've finally got the right perfect mixture." ...|$|E

2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... {{what seems to be}} the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great <b>things.</b> <b>Now</b> they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?"

Just don’t expect anything groundbreaking here." [...] Digital Spy gave the same console version four stars out of five and called it [...] "a triumphant mix of vintage shooter mechanics and high-octane driving segments. The end result is a title that captures the essence of its genre-defining predecessors while offering fans something new. id's Tech 5 engine ensures that this is the studio's best-look release to date, and the sheer volume of features on offer make {{it one of the most}} rewarding." [...] Softpedia gave the Xbox 360 version a score of four stars out of five and called it [...] "a must-have, must-play game." [...] The Digital Fix gave the same console version eight out of ten and called it [...] "a sound purchase". [...] The Guardian gave the same console version a similar score of four stars out of five and called it [...] "a decidedly mixed affair. It isn't perfect, some of it feels quite antiquated, and it is by no means the high-water moment in the FPS genre that Doom and Quake were in their day. But it is still a very eye-catching and incredibly fun shooter, and in its best moments, it can't be matched for pure entertainment value." ...|$|E
