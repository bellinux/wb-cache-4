I suppose it is the inevitable doom of all those who dabble in Scotch soil; but really your fate is the more blessed. I cannot conceive anything more grateful to me, or more amusing or more picturesque, than to live in a cottage outside your own park-walls.--With renewed thanks, believe me, dear Sir Herbert, yours very truly, ...|$|R
