5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise.|$|E
5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on the compromise still left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed the compromise for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of the compromise, supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. The compromise nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have obtained.|$|E
25|$|Predation {{levels on}} some burrow-nesting species {{can be quite}} high; on Alaska's Wooded Islands, for example, river otters munched their way through some 23 percent of the island's fork-tailed {{storm-petrel}} population during a single breeding season in 1977. There {{is some evidence that}} increased vulnerability may lead some burrow-nesting species to form colonies, or to nest closer to rival pairs in areas of high predation <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise do.|$|E

50|$|However, when Fitton's {{solicitor}} {{informed the}} trustees {{that he was}} now the nominee for the purchase, they refused {{to deal with them}} directly, as they were worried that by dealing with a nominee, rather <b>than</b> Paulin, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be liable for 2 separate amounts of stamp duty.|$|R
50|$|The Common House is {{the heart}} of Sunward {{community}} life, where members cook, eat, play, hang out, celebrate, meet, host events, and work together.

500|$|... "Mediocre comedies", as Scott Meslow of The Atlantic puts it, {{referring}} to films like Tooth Fairy, Bride Wars and Hotel for Dogs, {{all of which}} had tepid critical receptions but did better <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have at other times of year. In the 2010s, these films have been doing even better, with [...] and Identity Thief both vaulting past unimpressed critics to gross over $100 million in consecutive years; the former is the all-time top-grossing January release.|$|E
500|$|The {{next phase}} of the {{campaign}} involved the advance of Australian forces along the coast towards Sio, about [...] from Finschhafen. Following the capture of Gusika, {{the responsibility for the}} first part of the advance to Sio was taken over by the infantry of the 4th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Cedric Edgar. They were brought forward from Finschhafen early in December where they had been undertaking garrison duties and on 5 December, the 22nd Infantry Battalion began the advance, crossing the Kalueng River. Lacking the experience that the 2nd AIF units had, the Militia battalions advanced more cautiously <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have done so. They were supported by American landing craft equipped with rockets, which bombarded Japanese positions along the coast, while the expansion of the airfield around Finschhafen and the establishment of a naval facility there enabled the Allies to use Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft and PT boats to further attack Japanese resupply efforts.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> {{have been a few}} years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E
50|$|Also, if a {{consumer}} is in default under a credit agreement, and the credit provider has already commenced debt-enforcement proceedings, that agreement {{may not be}} subject to the debt review.

50|$|Finally, African-American {{literature}} has gained added attention {{through the work}} of talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, who repeatedly has leveraged her fame to promote literature {{through the medium of}} her Oprah's Book Club. At times, she has brought African-American writers a far broader audience <b>than</b> <b>they</b> otherwise <b>might</b> have received.|$|R
5000|$|Real {{life as a}} medium. Games use players' {{lives as}} a platform. Players are not {{required}} to build a character or role-play being someone other <b>than</b> themselves. <b>They</b> <b>might</b> unexpectedly overcome a challenge for the community simply because of the real-life knowledge and background they possessed. Participants are constantly on the lookout for clues embedded in everyday life.|$|R
500|$|Since the {{intention}} of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members, they can be understood {{in the context of}} virtual capital. [...] Players [...] "earn" [...] and [...] "spend" [...] DKP, bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them. [...] DKP are referred to as [...] "currency" [...] a guild leader pays his [...] "employees". [...] Despite these analogies, DKP remain a kind of [...] "private money system", allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline. [...] The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself; they are tracked on external websites. [...] In contrast, the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation. [...] Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild, parlaying of economic capital for DKP (paying real world currency in exchange for DKP) is almost unheard of. [...] Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what Torill Mortensen refers to as a [...] "social stabilizer"; players who attend raids more frequently or play by the rules reap the rewards while more [...] "casual" [...] gamers do not. [...] This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system (the guild) longer <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} rails {{were made}} of wood, which wore out quickly. Hardwood such as jarrah and karri were better than softwoods such as fir.

50|$|Very little {{software}} {{made use}} of the REUs. Like other add-on products from Commodore, their relatively small installed base relative to the huge number of C64s made software developers hesitant to invest much time and effort in supporting it, {{and the lack of}} commercial support kept sales lower <b>than</b> <b>they</b> otherwise <b>might</b> have been.|$|R

2500|$|The {{series was}} won comfortably, and the {{performances}} of Atherton and DeFreitas in particular very encouraging for future series', but the New Zealanders presented less of a challenge <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have done, {{and the result was}} as much a reflection of that as of the England performance.

2500|$|If some [...] "dissolution event" [...] (e.g. {{destruction}} of the leased property) had interrupted the payment of rent this would have prompted “the continuation of payments {{in the form of}} repurchase price”. This reduced the risk structure of the sukuk to that (or near that) of conventional bonds, which permits the sukuk to earn the same or close to the same credit ratings that conventional bonds earn. Consequently, they are able to be sold at an interest rater lower <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> otherwise, although their transactions costs are higher than conventional bonds because of the creation of SPVs, as well as payment of various jurist and legal fees for structuring the bond issuance.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the rare}} public {{accounts}} of a disruption took place in 2000 when the CBS News program 48 Hours {{told the story of}} Jesse and Crystal Money, an Atlanta-area couple who ultimately decided to disrupt the adoption of their nine-year-old Russian-born daughter and return her to the orphanage in Moscow she had previously lived in. The girl had severe reactive attachment disorder and the family feared for their physical safety due to her increasing violence. Since the girl had not acquired U.S. citizenship, her treatment options for that were more limited <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been for a domestically-born child. After she was returned to Russia, Frank Adoption Center, the Washington, D.C.-based agency that had originally placed her, was able to find a new American family willing to adopt her.|$|E
50|$|This style usually {{consists}} of a high waist (rising above the belly button), making the buttocks appear disproportionately longer, larger, and flatter <b>than</b> <b>they</b> otherwise <b>might.</b> It also tends to have excess space in the zipper/crotch and leg areas.

50|$|However, bidonvilles {{may have}} {{provided}} certain measures of social freedom and political space for disadvantaged or marginalized groups, albeit {{at the cost}} of appalling daily living conditions.

50|$|When {{goods were}} {{provided}} rather <b>than</b> cash, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> also include firewood and food for horses, {{as well as}} food for the army itself.

2500|$|The {{rural areas}} faced many {{difficulties}} opening and maintaining public schools. In the country, {{the public school}} was often a one-room affair that attracted about half the younger children. The teachers were poorly paid, and their pay was often in arrears. Conservatives contended the rural schools were too expensive and unnecessary for a region where {{the vast majority of}} people were cotton or tobacco farmers. They had no vision of a better future for their residents. One historian found that the schools were less effective <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been because [...] "poverty, the inability of the states to collect taxes, and inefficiency and corruption in many places prevented successful operation of the schools." [...] After Reconstruction ended and the whites disfranchised the blacks and imposed Jim Crow, they consistently underfunded black institutions, including the schools.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} bearing technology led {{to the adoption of}} roller bearings, rather <b>than</b> whitemetal.

60|$|Thus these {{appeals to}} the people failed, {{so far as the}} object of them was to call forth a popular {{demonstration}} in Richard's favor.

50|$|Marriage {{licences}} {{were introduced}} in the 14th century, to allow the usual notice period under banns to be waived, on payment of a fee and accompanied by a sworn declaration, {{that there was no}} canonical impediment to the marriage. Licences were usually granted by an archbishop, bishop or archdeacon. There could be a number of reasons for a couple to obtain a licence: <b>they</b> <b>might</b> wish to marry quickly (and avoid the three weeks' delay by the calling of banns); <b>they</b> <b>might</b> wish to marry in a parish away from their home parish; or, because a licence required a higher payment <b>than</b> banns, <b>they</b> <b>might</b> choose to obtain one as a status symbol.|$|R

40|$|As the {{relationship}} between God's gratuitousness and the contingecy {{of the world is}} concerned, Leibnizian modern theodicy and weak theology seem to radically contradict each other. Nevertheless, both perspectives are able to preserve the simultaneous presence of gratuity and unconditioned givenness of theophany together with the contingency of reality in its heteronomy from the rules of the creationist order, since it is also determined by fortuity. In this way both positions are much more closer <b>than</b> waht <b>they</b> <b>might</b> seem at a first sight...|$|R
