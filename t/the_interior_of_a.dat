5|$|In {{addition}} to hydrostatic equilibrium, <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior {{that results in}} a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.|$|E
5|$|The second tower with stepped gables {{but without}} a gate was the Lejontornet ("Lion's Tower"), the {{foundations}} of which were rediscovered during an archaeological excavation in 1984 and {{are now part of}} <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> restaurant on Yxsmedsgr√§nd.|$|E
5|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, {{akin to the}} eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning {{is said to be}} the source of illumination for those who claim to have seen <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tornado.|$|E

5|$|It {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Egypt (Cairo and Luxor) and Italy (Costa Smeralda, Sardinia), with underwater scenes filmed at the Bahamas (Nassau), and a new soundstage built at Pinewood Studios for a massive set which depicted <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supertanker. The Spy Who Loved Me was well-received by critics. The soundtrack composed by Marvin Hamlisch also met with success. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler {{was used for the}} waterfall sequence.|$|E

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive {{modes of}} play - a single player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both modes, players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these modes, the main menu {{of the game is}} designed around <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stable star is in a {{state of}} {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Prometheus was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage {{was built on the}} backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.|$|E

25|$|Note that in {{this article}} the words {{interior}} and boundary {{are used in the}} sense used in algebraic topology and manifold theory, not in the sense used in general topology: e.g. by <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line segment we mean the line segment without its endpoints and by its boundary, the two endpoints (in the general topology sense, <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line segment in the plane is empty and the line segment is its own boundary).|$|E

25|$|The {{sum of the}} {{distances}} from any point in <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular polyhedron to the sides is independent of {{the location of the}} point. (This is an extension of Viviani's theorem.) However, the converse does not hold, not even for tetrahedra.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the sound}} {{velocity}} of such non-linear elastic materials (including common construction materials like aluminium and steel) have a stress dependency, one {{application of the}} acoustoelastic effect may be measurement of the stress state in <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loaded material utilizing different acoustic probes (e.g. ultrasonic testing) to measure the change in sound velocities.|$|E
25|$|Black {{holes are}} {{predicted}} by the theory of general relativity.

The existence of black holes in the universe is well supported, both theoretically and by astronomical observation.|$|E
