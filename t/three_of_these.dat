5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|Explosive andesitic {{volcanism}} {{dominated the}} area {{to the west of}} Zion during Oligocene and early Miocene time and probably inundated the region with hundreds of feet of welded tuff that has since eroded away. <b>Three</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tuff layers are preserved on top of Brainhead Peak. About 21million years ago the Pine Valley laccolith formed. This typical mushroom-shaped laccolith {{is one of the largest}} intrusions of this type in the world. Debris flows carried boulders of this intrusion onto the Upper Kolob Plateau indicating that the Hurricane Cliffs could not have been present at the time.|$|E

Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and Heligoland Bight. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have}} {{supported}} the monophyly of <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> subfamilies (not Pereskioideae), but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level; indeed, a 2011 study found only 39% of the genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research were monophyletic. Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain {{and is likely to}} change.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
