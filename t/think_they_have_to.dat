500|$|... "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was also}} the first of five Homicide: Life on the Street episodes {{featuring}} Mel Proctor, then the home team sports announcer for the Washington Bullets, as recurring reporter character Grant Besser. Actor Walt MacPherson made a brief appearance as a uniformed police officer who finds an earring at the Adena Watson crime scene and offers it to Bayliss as possible evidence. MacPherson would return in the [...] as the recurring character Detective Roger Gaffney, but there is no indication whether or not the beat cop he played in [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was the same character. The line spoken by Lewis, [...] "Murderers lie because they have to, witnesses lie because they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> and everyone else lies for the sheer joy of it", is almost a verbatim line from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. The line represents a three-rule theorem about police work Simon created after following a Baltimore Police Department homicide unit for one year while writing his book.|$|E

[...] Ellison has also said, [...] "Osama bin Laden no more represents Islam than Timothy McVeigh represented Christianity." [...] Asked about the incident later, Ellison dismissed it, saying, [...] "It's just shock TV. Some pundits <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask the most outrageous questions." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] we all {{answered}} together, and Mrs. Makely said: [...] "With your Altrurian ideas, I {{suppose you}} would naturally sympathize {{a great deal}} more with the lower classes, and <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> endure all the hardships in our system; but if you could realize how the struggle goes on in the best society, and how we all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight for what we get, or don't get, you would be disposed to pity our upper classes, too." ...|$|R

He carried the double-barrelled gun I had given him, and was accompanied by {{one of my best}} hunters, a Natal native, who was also armed with a heavy smooth-bore loaded with slugs. Our hope was that the sound of these guns might terrify the foe, should there be occasion to use them before our forces joined up again, and make them <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with a body of raiding Dutch white men, of whose roers--as the heavy elephant guns of that day were called--all natives were much afraid.|$|R

I care as little as any man what my vassals think of me, seeing that {{whatsoever}} they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do mine orders. But it needs not to set them against one needlessly; so let the varlets go on with their play undisturbed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Those are old stories, Phipson, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> do {{with the}} dislike the French have of us.

5000|$|On 24 June 2014 Vardanyan was {{appointed}} Armenia's ambassador to Georgia. This move was negatively received by diplomats and politicians. For instance, Armenia's ex-Foreign Minister Alexander Arzumanyan said he deeply respects Vardanyan's achievements in sport, but questioned Vardanyan's knowledge of Armenian-Georgian relations. Defending the decision, ruling Republican Party Georgian-born MP Shirak Torosyan claimed that [...] "Armenia has never appointed a professional ambassador to Georgia ever since gaining independence" [...] and that [...] "Individuals accomplished {{in different areas}} have been appointed but they were never diplomats. So {{it has become a}} kind of tradition. As for the Armenian-Georgian relations, I don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be linked to the ambassador’s work. The ambassador is just required to use his potential to better develop those relations." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{never learned}} to drive, and could often be spotted riding a bicycle in New York City wearing a three-piece suit. He was shown that way in {{television}} spots promoting Newsday's New York edition, in which Kempton brought his bicycle {{to a stop at}} an intersection and deadpanned, [...] "I guess I've been around so long that people <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> like me." [...] His bicycling was also depicted in a cartoon showing him standing next to his three-speed bicycle that accompanied first a 1993 profile in The New Yorker and, then, the jacket of what proved his final book, an anthology called Rebellions, Perversities, and Main Events. Kempton dedicated the book to Buckley, whom he once admitted had nagged him for years to assemble the collection: [...] "For William F. Buckley, Jr., genius at friendships that surpass all understanding." ...|$|E
5000|$|During spring {{training}} in 1983, Tobik {{was traded to}} the Texas Rangers for outfielder Johnny Grubb. [...] Prior to the trade, Sparky Anderson pointed to Tobik's nine losses during the 1982 season and noted, [...] "Tell me what a relief pitcher is doing with nine losses. That's nine times he came in with a lead and couldn't hold it." [...] Playing for the Rangers in 1983, Tobik converted all nine of his save opportunities for the Rangers. [...] Tobik pitched two seasons for the Rangers, appearing in 51 games, all in relief. In July 1984, the Rangers sent Tobik to Oklahoma City. On being sent to Oklahoma City, Tobik told reporters, [...] "I don't know what to think anymore. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have a reason all the time for doing things. I'm a major league pitcher. I don't deserve this but what can you do?" ...|$|E

We analyze the historical and archaeological sources as well as the results of our fieldwork. A distribution of Roman and Iberian sites along the axis marked by the road CV- 41 (Algemesí-Alzira-Manuel) is observed and we <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be linked with the tracing of the Vía Augusta. We also have identified other axis that follows partly the CV- 550, {{and that it would be}} subsidiary to the first one, communicating the high flow of the Magro river with the Xúquer plain...|$|E
30|$|Indeed, albeit {{classified}} as “economic”, {{practices such as}} owning a house or sending money to Senegal are not merely financial. Economic remittances relate {{to a series of}} other cross-border activities, usually considered as “social”, such as calling relatives back home or visiting them (see also Vickstrom, this issue). Economic remittances have a symbolic and communicative function. These transfers “are to be understood as a communicative act, i.e. a mode of expression of emigrants through which they formulate what they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do in accordance with who they think they are” (Lacroix, 2010). Through their transfers, migrants “take a stand on their plural being” and remittances constitute a tangible mean through which migrants weave together the “disjointed poles of their existence”, here and there (Lacroix, 2014).|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Belgium has {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992, few {{children with special needs}} are taken care of in mainstream services. When they have access to a service, everything is focused on their deficiency. Professionals <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be trained to give what is considered as the “right” treatment to make the child « catch the others up ». There is an alternative way of thinking that focuses on each child’s competences. Adopting this way of thinking means to consider that what matters is every little thing a child can bring to the group, whatever his characteristics may be, and how he can benefit from daily life with other children and adults. The workshop has been focused on conditions that can help increase quality provisions : Who is welcomed everyday? How does an ECEC service welcome each family? Are there children and families who don’t come to ECEC services? Why don’t they come? Are they sufficiently informed on the inclusive approach of ECEC services, Etc The conference has referred to some testimonies collected by professionals from the French Community of Belgium.
