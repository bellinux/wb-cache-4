5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> of evolution, with fears that Darwinism {{had led to}} German militarism and {{was a threat to}} religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> of evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

Inscriptions of these names can be found in once pagan regions of Edessa dating back to the fourth and third century AD and are rarely mentioned in Syriac sources from the fifth century AD and after. According to scholar Harold Attridge, Addai's first Christian converts mentioned in the Martyrdom of Barsamya and the Acts of Sharbel were incorporated in a literary writing style similar to that of the Acts of Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habbib. With such similarities, he deduced that the Acts of Sharbel and the Martyrdom of Barsamya were written by the same group of pagan authors inspired to integrate their ancestral pagan ideology into the Christian community through the use of the Sharbel and Barsamya texts.|$|E

A total of 1200 teachers from 60 schools in Malacca, Perak and Pulau Penang were chosen as the repondents of this study which was conducted in the middle of 2007. A set of questionnaire consisting of: Emotional Competence Inventory (ECI) was utilized to measure emotional intelligence, the Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI) to measure work stress and <b>the</b> Propensity <b>To</b> Leave Index (PLI) <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> intention <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> profession was used.
