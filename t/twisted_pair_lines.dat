The cable, which carried 6 toll lines required intensive maintenance and was entirely replaced 3 times before its use was abandoned in 1909.

40|$|A digital {{transmission}} scheme for <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>lines</b> is presented, which combines coding, precoding, and blind equalization. By channel coding, a significant gain in maximum tolerable field length can be obtained. Intersymbol interference (ISI) is combated by Tomlinson-Harashima precoding. However, in many cases, reverse transmission of channel state {{information should be}} avoided. Therefore, a fixed precoder is used, designed for a reference application. Then, residual ISI has to be equalized at the receiver. To accomplish this in a blind manner, a modification of the precoder is necessary, leading to Dynamics Shaping (DS). With DS, blind adaptation can be performed by a powerful novel algorithm consisting of several stages, which is suited for reconstruction of correlated data due to precoding. 1.

40|$|A new {{combined}} precoding/shaping {{technique for}} fast digital transmission over <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>lines</b> is proposed. Major advantages of this "dynamics shaping" are: Dynamics {{of the signal}} at the input of the decision device are reduced by a great amount.

A trade-off between signal dynamics at the transmitter output, decision device input and SNR-gain by noise whitening is offered. For dynamics limitation relevant in practice, gains up to 6 dB are achieved. Additionally, the transmitter can be fixed to a typical application because, in contrast to Tomlinson-Harashima or other precoding techniques, blind adaptive equalization is practicable to remove residual intersymbol interference {{in the case of}} a mismatch of precoding and actual cable characteristics. The residual SNR-loss is negligible in most applications. SNR-gains due to noise prediction, channel coding and signal shaping simply can be combined us [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{new concept}} for digital {{communication}} over severe intersymbol interference producing channels, e. g., high–rate digital transmission over <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>lines</b> (xDSL techniques) is proposed including channel coding, precoding, equalization, and synchronization. Channel coding improves data reliability or tolerable signal attenuation, e. g., field length, whereas a nonlinear predistortion method, {{a modification of}} the well–known Tomlinson–Harashima precoding (THP) including signal shaping and dynamics limitation at the receiver side, is used in order to cope with intersymbol interference.

By this, neither a blocking of bidirectional communication can happen nor sophisticated start–up protocols are necessary. For this purpose new algorithms for blind adaptive equalization are introduced which are able to operate at very low signal–to–noise ratios due to channel coding and for highly correlated data sequences, typically for the application of precoding techniques. Additionally, methods for symbol timing synchronization are proposed...|$|E
30|$|Otherwise, we must {{stress the}} fact that the {{transmission}} characteristics of the channel determine directly the performance of communication systems. Therefore, several channel models were proposed to accurately simulate the effect of transmission of the MC signal through the channel. Particularly, it is proven that in <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>lines,</b> the channel is well modeled by a recursive filter with a slowly decaying IR [8, 9]. This means that the channel transfer function presents poles close to the unit circle (UC). By exploiting this result, we propose in this paper to develop a specific framework for slowly decaying recursive channel shortening. Indeed, approximated by a stable pole-zero model, we need to show that the channel poles introduce a term of interference in each received MC symbols. Thus, in order to shorten the recursive channel, an effective TEQ will place their zeros on the critical poles to cancel them out. Yet, {{it is worth noting that}} inaccurate zeros position results in a limited channel-shortening performance, which motivates the use of lattice structure to cancel channel poles. Therefore, this can be effectively done only by adopting the lattice structure which must be conceived by optimizing appropriate channel-shortening criteria.|$|E

50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on {{a single pair of}} wires. A <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>line</b> rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) {{technology is}} used to provide high speed Internet access and, more recently, video services over <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> <b>lines.</b> Telephone lines have impairments that hinder DSL transmission, and some examples are coils and bridge taps that were introduced to aid voice telephony. Other faults are caused by physical damage that results in open circuits, short circuits or water in the line. Telephone companies have to locate and repair these faults to enable high-speed data services. It is also useful to “qualify” lines for future DSL service so that a new customer can be promptly informed whether high-speed service can be supplied. This thesis proposes a novel technique called Wideband frequency domain reflectometry (W-FDR) to accurately locate impairments in telephone lines and estimate the reflection magnitude caused by faults. The measurement produces a result similar to the well-known time domain reflectometer (TDR), however, digital signal processing techniques are now applied to provide enhanced resolution and range. In addition to magnitude, the new technique is able to measure reflection angle which can help to determine {{the nature of the}} fault (wire in the cable, broken wires, etc). The measurement technique consists of energizing the line with a sinusoid that increases from 50 kHz to 1300 kHz in discrete frequency steps after coherent detection. The amplitude of the reflected signal is recorded as a function of frequency for 2500 equally spaced frequencies. The Fourier transform and some signal processing are then used to estimate the complex reflection coefficient location of the faults in the telephone line. Lines with up to 4 reflection points have been accurately analyzed. Results show distance measurement accuracy better than 1 % and phase measurement accuracy better than 10 degrees for line lengths up to 5 km. These measurements exceed the performance of currently available TDR instruments...|$|E
