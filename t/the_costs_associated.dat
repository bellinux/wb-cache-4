Color Air had an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with membership.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} some locker room tension over <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with the costume, Konnan's {{perceived}} attitude, and Konnan also was missing tapings {{because he was}} more successful in Mexico and was not focusing on WWF. In the end, the Max Moon character was given to Paul Diamond, who appeared as the character on the first episode of Monday Night Raw on January 11, 1993. After a brief run, the character was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E

One Way Productions came to an agreement with MGM {{that it would take}} care of <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with advertising and distributing the film, if MGM agreed to distribute Inchon for a profit share of only 15 percent. The normal fee for the film distributor was thirty percent of profits. The film, cut to 105 minutes, was released in the United States on the weekend of September 17, 1982. It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office, and was never shown in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with the Order. Prior to this date {{it had been the}} policy that the {{insignia}} (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with staff, Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown. The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown, which meant {{the state could}} have lost about $1.25 million in revenue daily. Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes, which must be affixed to each pack before sale. The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would {{come to a halt}} by mid-August if no more tax stamps were issued. The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards, which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers. Many stores, bars, and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown. However, the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired {{on the first day of}} the shutdown, July 1. Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month. Alcohol brand licenses expired, so MillerCoors lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota, and had to have them removed from shelves.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a general {{equilibrium}} model that examines the emergence of non-exclusive franchise contracts {{in the presence of}} the franchisor hold‐up problem.

We show that when <b>the</b> contracting <b>cost</b> relative to <b>the</b> relational <b>cost</b> is high and when the economies of specialization is low, a non‐exclusive franchise contract is an optimal contractual arrangement to mitigate franchisor opportunism. ...|$|R

25|$|Chick {{recognition}} reduces <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with parasitism, and coots {{are one of}} {{only three}} bird species in which this behavior has evolved. This is because hatching order is predictable in parasitized coots—host eggs will reliably hatch before parasite eggs. In other species where hatching order is not as reliable, there is a risk of misimprinting on a parasite chick first and then rejecting their own chicks. In these species, the cost of accidentally misimprinting is greater than the benefits of rejecting parasite chicks.|$|E

25|$|Making {{comparisons}} between wind {{and other sources}} of energy can be difficult {{because of the cost}} profiles associated with wind developments. The vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> with wind developments are upfront capital costs.

By comparison, conventional gas and coal developments have large capital costs, as well as significant operating costs.
