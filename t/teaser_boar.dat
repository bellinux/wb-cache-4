40|$|Our {{objective}} was to {{study the effects of}} housing conditions and the amount of boar contact in a protocol for estrus detection on estrus detection rate, timing of onset of estrus, duration of estrus, and timing of ovulation. After weaning, 130 multiparous sows were assigned to three treatments: HI, in which 52 sows were housed individually in crates and received a high amount of boar contact during estrus detection; HG, in which 52 sows were housed in groups and received a high amount of boar contact; and NI, in which 26 sows were housed individually in crates and received a normal amount of boar contact. Estrus detection was performed every 8 h. For each treatment, the standing response to three levels of stimuli was recorded: a back pressure test (BPT) by a man (man-estrus), presence of a <b>teaser</b> <b>boar</b> (spontaneous-estrus), and BPT {{in the presence of a}} <b>teaser</b> <b>boar</b> (boar-estrus). In addition, for HI and HG, the standing response to a fourth level of stimuli was recorded: BPT in a detection-mating area, surrounded by four boar pens (DMA-estrus). To detect ovulation, ultrasonography was performed every 4 h during estrus. Of 117 sows that ovulated, 46 ␜howed man-estrus, 56 ␜pontaneous-estrus, 90 ␋oar-estrus, and 97 MA-estrus. Mean onset of man-estrus was 107 h (SD 26) after weaning, of spontaneous-estrus was 106 h (SD 22) after weaning, of boar-estrus was 99 h (SD 21) after weaning, and of DMA-estrus was 93 h (SD 22) after weaning. Duration of man-estrus was 22 h (SD 14), of spontaneous-estrus was 29 h (SD 16), of boar-estrus was 42 h (SD 20), and of DMA-estrus was 55 h (SD 18). The high amount of boar contact reduced the number of sows showing man-estrus (P <. 05; 41 ␏or HG and HI vs 68 ␏or NI) and reduced duration of boar-estrus (P <. 05; 43 h for HG and HI vs 52 h for NI). Duration of DMA-estrus for HG and HI was similar to duration of boar-estrus for NI. Onset of estrus and timing of ovulation were not affected by amount of boar contact. Group housing did not affect detection rate and duration of estrus, but it did postpone average onset of estrus by 10 h, paralleled by a postponement of ovulation. In conclusion, estrus expression is similar at the highest level of stimuli in different protocols for estrus detection. Including higher levels of stimuli in a protocol reduces estrus expression at lower levels of stimuli. This reduction indicates adaptation of sows to a given protocol for estrus detection. Group housing can delay ovulation and related behavioral estrus...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} {{influences}} of specific boar stimuli on uterine activity in estrous sows, by comparing uterine activity in presence of a mature <b>teaser</b> <b>boar</b> and a robot boar with variable stimuli. Nineteen multiparous, cyclic, commercial crossbred sows were used. Intra-luminal uterine pressure was measured using a non-surgical method for 45 min before applying one of four treatments in combination with a back-pressure-test (BPT) : (1) robot with olfactory and auditory stimuli (R + O + A) (n = 16), (2) robot with auditory stimuli (R + A) (n = 16), (3) robot without additional stimuli (R) (n = 16), (4) a mature boar (boar) (n = 15). After treatment, measurements continued for 30 min. For each measurement, frequency, mean amplitude and mean duration of uterine contractions were determined. Spontaneous frequency of uterine contractions was 18. 6 ± 0. 7 h¿ 1 on average and did not differ between treatments. Frequency of contractions increased significantly for the boar (+ 5. 6 ± 1. 3 h¿ 1; P < 0. 01), R + O + A (+ 3. 9 ± 1. 3; P < 0. 01) and R + A (+ 2. 6 ± 1. 3; P < 0. 05). The effect of boar presence on frequency of contractions was greater than the effect of R (P < 0. 05). Amplitude and duration of contractions were not affected by treatment. The change in frequency was dependent on spontaneous frequency (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, the higher the level of boar stimuli, the greater the increase in frequency of uterine contractions. The {{results indicate that the}} used combinations of artificial boar stimuli do not mimic a `whole¿ boar. It is unclear which boar stimuli stimulate maximal uterine activity during estru...|$|E
