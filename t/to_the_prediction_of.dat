The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons.

Melbourne then moved all their home games except one against the struggling New Zealand Knights to Docklands for the 2006/07 season. The move was a success, with a 27,000 crowd average. The Victory decided to move all their home games permanently from the 2007/08 season. This also gave the stadium a major summer tenant, which the stadium lacked in its early years.|$|E

2500|$|Kirkpatrick, Rankin & Long’s {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> {{the enhanced}} punching strength of bridge deck slabs {{was based on}} the punching shear prediction equation derived by Long for the shear mode of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement.

[...] The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin’s idealised elastic-plastic stress-strain criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm2, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry’s ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete.|$|E
2500|$|The {{account of}} Josephus in The Jewish War, {{refers to the}} Onias who built the Temple at Leontopolis as [...] "the son of Simon", {{implying}} that it was Onias III, and not his son, who fled to Egypt and built the Temple. This account, however, is contradicted by the story that Onias III was murdered at Antioch in 171 BCE. Josephus' account in the Antiquities is therefore more probable, namely, that the builder of the temple was a son of the murdered Onias III, and that, a mere youth {{at the time of}} his father's death, he had fled to the court of Alexandria in consequence of the Syrian persecutions, perhaps because he thought that salvation would come to his people from Egypt. Ptolemy VI was King of Egypt at that time. He probably had not yet given up his claims to Coele-Syria and Judea, and gladly gave refuge to such a prominent personage of the neighboring country. Onias now requested the king and his sister-wife, Cleopatra, to allow him to build a sanctuary in Egypt similar to the one at Jerusalem, where he would employ Levites and priests of his own clan; and he referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> the prophet Isaiah that a Jewish temple would be erected in Egypt.|$|E

In Experiment 1, 3 - to 5 -year-old children made inferences about highly familiar categories. The results were not fully consistent with either theoretical account.

In Experiment 2 we investigated the mechanisms by which labels promote induction by examining the influence of different label types, namely category labels (e. g., the target and category-match both labeled as bird) and descriptor labels (e. g., the target and the perceptual lure both labeled as brown) on induction performance.

60|$|On this ground, though I can {{not accept}} as {{positive}} truths any of those scientific hypotheses which are unsusceptible of being ultimately brought to the test of actual induction, such, for instance, as the two theories of light, the emission theory of the last century, and the undulatory theory which predominates in the present, I am yet unable to agree with those who consider such hypotheses to be worthy of entire disregard. As is well said by Hartley (and concurred in by a thinker in general so diametrically opposed to Hartley’s opinions as Dugald Stewart), “any hypothesis which has so much plausibility as to explain {{a considerable number of}} facts, helps us to digest these facts in proper order, to bring new ones to light, and make experimenta crucis for the sake of future inquirers.”(183) If an hypothesis both explains known facts, and has led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> others previously unknown, and since verified by experience, the laws of the phenomenon which is the subject of inquiry must bear at least a great similarity to those of the class of phenomena to which the hypothesis assimilates it; and since the analogy which extends so far may probably extend further, nothing is more likely to suggest experiments tending to throw light upon the real properties of the phenomenon, than the following out such an hypothesis. But to this end {{it is by no means}} necessary that the hypothesis be mistaken for a scientific truth. On the contrary, that illusion is in this respect, as in every other, an impediment to the progress of real knowledge, by leading inquirers to restrict themselves arbitrarily to the particular hypothesis which is most accredited at the time, instead of looking out for every class of phenomena between the laws of which and those of the given phenomenon any analogy exists, and trying all such experiments as may tend to the discovery of ulterior analogies pointing in the same direction.|$|E
