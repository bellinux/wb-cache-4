5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board.

It {{may be the case}} that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E
