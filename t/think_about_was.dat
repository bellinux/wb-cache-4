Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick remembers being [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he could <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>was</b> stumbling upon a snake.|$|E

The turn of the head was the same; the tired look in the eyes {{at the end of a}} long walk was the same; the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same; and once, most marvellous of all, Mrs. Landys- Haggert singing to herself in the next room, while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride, hummed, note for note, with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second line:--"Poor Wandering One!"

He had never been looked at in just that way--with just that fixed, intense smile--by any woman; and it perplexed and weighed upon him, now, that {{the woman who was}} smiling so and who had instantly given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented attributes, was his own niece, the child of his own father's daughter.

The strange word [...] "morganatic" [...] was constantly in his ears; it reminded him of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he had once known and who had been a bold, unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it was his duty, so long as the Baroness looked at him, smiling in that way, to meet her glance with his own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision; but on this occasion he failed to perform his duty to the last. He looked away toward his daughters. [...] "We are very glad to see you," [...] he had said. [...] "Allow me to introduce my daughters--Miss Charlotte Wentworth, Miss Gertrude Wentworth." ...|$|E
