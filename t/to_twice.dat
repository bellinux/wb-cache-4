5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} bird of prey with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals {{bought the}} mining rights, and {{operated}} a train once <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> {{a year to}} keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The mining company was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the mining company to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the mining company. Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen dramatically since {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year. The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line was the northern-most railway in the world until 2010, when Russia's Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line was opened.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> as fast.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} 32Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141wickets in Test cricket—a world record {{at the time}} of his retirement—at an average of 21.78runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, {{including}} the authoritative Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> Portia′s size. P. labiata is killed in 2.1% of pursuits and injured but not killed in 3.9%, P. schultzi is killed in 1.7% and injured but not killed in 5.3%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is killed in 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not killed in another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may lose one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass 2 (a.k.a.

5|$|After {{being offered}} a trial with Universitatea Craiova by an agent, McBreen signed for the Romanian Divizia A club in July 2002 on a three-year contact. He made his debut in 3–1 win over Astra Ploiești on 17 August 2002, and scored {{only once in}} 13 {{appearances}} for a Craiova team that ranked seventh in the 2002–03 Divizia A table. However, the players' wages were continually paid late throughout the season and McBreen came close to a move to Norwegian Tippeligaen club Lillestrøm, only for Craiova <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> raise their asking price for him on transfer deadline day. He played more regularly the next season, making 20 appearances and scoring twice as Craiova finished fourth in the 2003–04 Divizia A table. He finally left Craiova {{during the summer of}} 2004 after the club's president Pavel Badea, a former teammate of McBreen's at the club, signed a letter releasing him from his contract. He took his case to FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the help of Professional Footballers Australia, and only received the money he was owed after the club was given a three-point deduction and was threatened with automatic relegation.|$|E

5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased <b>to</b> <b>twice</b> a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of some ten young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere quit, {{and at the same time}} Bastei increased the rhythm again, now to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a free lance basis. The next year, they decided to go behind Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E
