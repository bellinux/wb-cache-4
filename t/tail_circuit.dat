40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are {{equipped}} with inhibitory and disinhibitory mechanisms that enable to choose valuable objects and actions. Notably, a value can be determined flexibly by recent experience or stably by prolonged experience. Recent studies have revealed that the head and tail of the caudate nucleus selectively and differentially process flexible and stable values of visual objects. These signals are sent to the superior colliculus through {{different parts of the}} substantia nigra, so that the animal looks preferentially at high-valued objects, but in different manners. Relying on short-term value memories, the caudate head circuit allows gaze to move expectantly to recently valued objects. Relying on long-term value memories, the caudate <b>tail</b> <b>circuit</b> allows gaze to move automatically to previously valued objects. The basal ganglia also contain an equivalent parallel mechanism for action values. Such flexible-stable parallel mechanisms for object and action values create a highly adaptable system for decision making...|$|E

40|$|During {{a series}} of network {{management}} retreats in June and July 1990, representatives from NASA Headquarters Codes O and S agreed on networking roles and responsibilities for their respective organizations. The representatives decided that NASA Science Internet (NSI) will assume management of both the Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) and the NASA Science Network (NSN). SPAN {{is now known as}} the NSI/DECnet, and NSN is now known as the NSI/IP. Some management functions will be distributed between Ames Research Center (ARC) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). NSI at ARC has the lead role for requirements generation and networking engineering. Advanced Applications and the Network Information Center is being developed at GSFC. GSFC will lead the NSI User Services, but NSI at Ames will continue to provide the User Services during the transition. The transition will be made as transparent as possible for the users. DECnet service will continue, but is now directly managed by NSI at Ames. NSI will continue to work closely with routing center managers at other NASA centers, and has formed a transition team to address the change in management. An NSI/DECnet working group had also been formed as a separate engineering group within NSI to plan the transition to Phase 5, DECnet's approach to Open System Integration (OSI). Transition is not expected {{for a year or more}} due to delays in produce releases. Plans to upgrade speeds in <b>tail</b> <b>circuits</b> and the backbone are underway. The proposed baseline service for new connections is up to 56 Kbps; 9. 6 Kbps lines will gradually be upgraded as requirements dictate.

40|$|Abstract — Denial of Service (DoS) {{attacks are}} one of the most {{challenging}} threats to Internet security. An attacker typically compromises a large number of vulnerable hosts and uses them to flood the victim’s site with malicious traffic, clogging its <b>tail</b> <b>circuit</b> and interfering with normal traffic. At present, the network operator of a site under attack has no other resolution but to respond manually by inserting filters in the appropriate edge routers to drop attack traffic. However, as DoS attacks become increasingly sophisticated, manual filter propagation becomes unacceptably slow or even infeasible. In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering, a new automatic filter propagation protocol. We argue that this system provides a guaranteed, significant level of protection against DoS attacks in exchange for a reasonable, bounded amount of router resources. We also argue that the proposed system cannot be abused by a malicious node to interfere with normal Internet operation. Finally, we argue that it retains its efficiency in the face of continued Internet growth. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a bandwidth-flooding attack, {{compromised}} sources send high-volume {{traffic to}} the target {{with the purpose of}} causing congestion in its <b>tail</b> <b>circuit</b> and disrupting its legitimate communications. In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering (AITF), a network-layer defense mechanism against such attacks. AITF enables a receiver to contact misbehaving sources and ask them to stop sending it traffic; each source that has been asked to stop is policed by its own Internet service provider (ISP), which ensures its compliance. An ISP that hosts misbehaving sources either supports AITF (and accepts to police its misbehaving clients), or risks losing all access to the complaining receiver—this is a strong incentive to cooperate, especially when the receiver is a popular public-access site. We show that AITF preserves a significant fraction of a receiver’s bandwidth in the face of bandwidth flooding, and does so at a per-client cost that is already affordable for today’s ISPs; this per-client cost is not expected to increase, as long as botnetsize growth does not outpace Moore’s law. We also show that even the first two networks that deploy AITF can maintain their connectivity {{to each other in the}} face of bandwidth flooding. We conclude that the network-layer of the Internet can provide an effective, scalable, and incrementally deployable solution against bandwidth-flooding attacks. I...|$|E

40|$|The Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) is a {{component}} of the global DECnet Internet, which has over 17, 000 host computers. The growth of SPAN from its implementation in 1981 to its present size of well over 2, 500 registered SPAN host computers, has created a need for users to acquire timely information about the network through a central source. The SPAN Network Information Center (SPAN-NIC) an online facility managed by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) was developed to meet this need for SPAN-wide information. The remote node descriptive information in this document is not currently contained in the SPAN-NIC database, but will be incorporated in the near future. Access to this information is also available to non-DECnet users over a variety of networks such as Telenet, the NASA Packet Switched System (NPSS), and the TCP/IP Internet. This publication serves as the Yellow Pages for SPAN node information. The document also provides key information concerning other computer networks connected to SPAN, nodes associated with each SPAN routing center, science discipline nodes, contacts for primary SPAN nodes, and SPAN reference information. A section on DECnet Internetworking discusses SPAN connections with other wide-area DECnet networks (many with thousands of nodes each). Another section lists node names and their disciplines, countries, and institutions in the SPAN Network Information Center Online Data Base System. All remote sites connected to US-SPAN and European-SPAN (E-SPAN) are indexed.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of putative contributors to age-related memory loss are poorly understood. The <b>tail</b> withdrawal <b>circuit</b> {{of the sea}} hare, a straightforward neural model, was used to investigate the aging characteristics of rudimentary learning. The simplicity of this neuronal circuit permits attribution of declines in the function of specific neurons to aging declines. Memory was impaired in advanced age animals compared to their performance {{at the peak of}} sexual maturity, with habituation training failing to attenuate the tail withdrawal response or to reduce tail motoneuron excitability, as occurred in peak maturity siblings. Baseline motoneuron excitability of aged animals was significantly lower, perhaps contributing to a smaller scope for attenuation. Conduction velocity in afferent fibers to tail sensory neurons decreased during aging. The findings suggest that age-related changes in tail sensory and motor neurons result in deterioration of a simple form of learning in Aplysia...|$|R

40|$|All complex organisms {{possess a}} nervous system which {{they use to}} monitor {{environmental}} and internal stimuli. In higher vertebrates, the nervous system is comprised of billions of cells which form highly plastic neural networks from their synapses. These large neural circuits modulate complex behaviors. The nematode roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans uses a small but highly-interconnected nervous system to carry out complex behaviors. The nervous system of C. elegans is a tractable model {{to determine the effects}} of changes on a nervous system at the systemic, cellular, genetic, and molecular levels. The C. elegans male?s nervous system detects environmental conditions, mating cues, attractants, repellents, and the location and composition of possible food sources and integrates these inputs to compute the decision of whether or not to mate. Mating behavior in the C. elegans male is regulated at a number of steps by cholinergic signaling from various sensory and sensory-motor neurons, but a comprehensive model of how cholinergic signaling controls this circuit has not yet been elucidated. Previous studies have thoroughly dissected the cellular structure, neural connectivity, and signaling pathways of the male?s peripheral circuits located in the genital regions of the animal?s tail. However, no studies have been conducted to determine what role the cephalic cholinergic neurons have in regulating mating behavior. I hypothesized that cephalic cholinergic neurons exert regulatory control over the male-specific mating circuit. I inserted the transmembrane light-activated ion pore Channelrhodopsin- 2 fused to YFP and expressed from the Punc- 17 small promoter into these neurons and selectively stimulated them using high-intensity blue light. Stimulation induced mating-like behaviors in the male tail consistent with behaviors seen during copulation with a hermaphrodite. Using behavioral assays, I demonstrated that these behaviors were male-specific and only occurred after direct stimulation in the absence of a hermaphrodite. Incidence of mating-like behaviors increased significantly as the worm aged, and the mating circuit retained a memory of the stimulus, indicated by the latency between stimulation and onset of mating-like behaviors. Brief food deprivation, which normally downregulates excitability of the mating circuit via UNC- 103 ERG-like K+ channels, caused an unexpected increase in the number of blue light-stimulated behaviors displayed. Pharmacological assays using acetylcholine (ACh) agonists showed that stimulation of the cephalic cholinergic neurons increased propensity for spicule protraction in the presence of an ACh agonist, and partially restored the decline in spicule protraction associated with temporary food deprivation. I sought to identify the cephalic cholinergic neuron or neurons responsible for regulating mating-like behavior in the <b>tail</b> <b>circuits.</b> I looked for a reduction in mating-like behaviors after stimulation after removal of a cephalic cholinergic neuron pair via laser micro-ablation. Two cholinergic and chemosensory neuron pairs in the inner labial sensilla (IL 2 L/R and IL 2 VL/R) appear to generate and/or relay the signal that induces mating-like behaviors in the tail. I hypothesize that these neurons sense environmental cues before the male contacts a mate, and modulate lasting motivational changes within the male mating circuit...|$|R

Different from other systems, layout generation is based on optimal complex modules rather than simple single devices. A novel genetic placement approach with simulated annealing is developed. The minimum-Steiner-tree based global routing can be integrated into the placement procedure in order to improve the routability of placement solutions. The compaction based constructive detailed routing finally realizes the layout of the whole circuit. Several examples are given to demonstrate its design efficiency and usability. Experiments show that it is superior to the existing tools and can provide comparable results to manual layouts. 1...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{track circuit}} interrupters were {{directly}} connected to the rail, both physically and electrically. One of the track <b>circuit</b> <b>tail</b> cables would {{be connected to the}} interrupter, it being connected to the rail. If the interrupter was broken, it was possible that the broken part, with cable still attached, could drop onto the rail and allow the track circuit to remain energised and show 'clear'. To overcome this, it is now practice for track circuit interrupters to be insulated from the rail to which they are attached. A track circuit cable is taken via the interrupter, with one end connected to the upper part of it and another end to the lower part. The cable is at opposite polarity to the rail, therefore should the broken part of the interrupter drop onto the rail, the track circuit will be short circuited and show 'occupied'.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study conducted}} to investigate the feasibility of using the existing Les Resources Camchib mill facilities to treat a new gold [...] copper ore called S- 3. Analysis of the S- 3 ore indicated that copper exists as chalcopyrite and that gold as free gold or in association with sulphides. The S- 3 ore typically contains 0. 3 % copper and from 3. 0 to 5. 5 g/t gold. The study involved both laboratory and plant testing. Four routes were investigated to treat the S- 3 ore: flotation with the present circuit and reagents, flotation with the present circuit and new reagents, flotation at natural pH in a slightly modified circuit, and direct cyanidation. Alkaline pH flotation in the existing mill circuit with Aero 3477 and Xanthate 343 as collectors (the second route) gave the most promising copper and gold recoveries. A Laboratory locked cycle test indicated that a copper concentrate grading 18. 4 % Cu with 89. 4 % gold and 94. 9 % copper recovery can be obtained. Plant flotation test yielded a copper concentrate grading 16. 9 % Cu with 82. 0 % gold and 95. 7 % copper recoveries.

40|$|The {{front-end}} electronics for the ALICE TPC to {{read out}} the charge detected by 570132 pads {{located on the}} readout chamber end-caps is here presented. The read-out chambers are multiwire proportional chambers with cathode pad read-out. The pads receive as the image charge of the signal on the anode amplification wires a signal with a fast rise time (less than 1 ns), and a long tail due to {{the motion of the}} positive ions. The signal is delivered on the detector impedance which varies between 3 pF to 12 pF. Therefore the front-end electronics must cope with different pad capacities. The electronics will be located in an area with limited access. High reliability is thus a concern. The circuit was developed in 0. 35 µm CMOS technology. The front-end electronics consist of a charge sensitive preamplifier/shaper, a 10 -bit 10 MHz low-power ADC and an ASIC which contains a shortening digital filter for the tail cancellation, the baseline subtraction and zero-suppression circuits, and a multiple-event buffer [3]. The image charge induced on the TPC pads is amplified and integrated by a low input-impedance amplifier. It is based on a continously sensitive charge sensitive amplifier followed by a semi-gaussian pulse shaper of second order. The amplitude, which is different for the 3 different pad sizes, has a typical value of 7 µA. The Preamplifier/shaper for the ALICE TPC (Fig. 1) is based on the design of the preamplifier/shaper for the NA 45 /CERES TPC. The main modifications concern: • migration from the technology AMS CMOS 0. 8 µm to the AMS CMOS 0. 35 µm; • optimization of the design to better fulfil the ALICE requirements; • removal of the <b>tail</b> cancellation <b>circuit</b> that, in the ALICE design, is implemented in the digital ASIC. This continuously sensitive design is particularly suitable for a detector with high occupancy. A peaking time of τs = 120 ns and noise consideration ( 10 MΩ.

40|$|Creation of a {{dominance}} hierarchy {{within a}} population of animals typically involves a period of agonistic activity in which winning and losing decide relative positions in the hierarchy. Among crayfish, fighting between size-matched animals leads to an abrupt change of behavior as the new subordinate retreats and escapes from the attacks and approaches of the dominant (Issa et al., 1999). We used high-speed videography and electrical recordings of aquarium field potentials to monitor the release of aggressive and defensive behavior, including the activation of neural circuits for four different tail-flip behaviors. We found that the sequence of tail-flip circuit excitation traced {{the development of their}} dominance hierarchy. Offensive tail flipping, attacks, and approaches by both animals were followed by a sharp rise in the frequency of nongiant and medial giant escape tail flips and a fall in the frequency of offensive tail flips of the new subordinate. These changes suggest that sudden, coordinated changes in the excitability of a set of neural circuits in one animal produce the changes in behavior that mark its transition to subordinate status. Key words: crayfish; fighting; agonistic interaction; dominance hierarchy; social behavior; field potential; escape; command neuron; <b>tail</b> flip; neural <b>circuit</b> activation Social dominance hierarchies are an organizing mechanism for most animal societies (Wilson, 1975) and are readily observable because of the different patterns of behavior displayed by animals of different social rank.
