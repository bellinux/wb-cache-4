5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> sent to Watts, who is seen looking at it while supervising the crime scene. Black is also at the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have shown that a task-irrelevant emotionally arousing {{stimulus}} can interfere with the processing of a shortly following target, it remains unclear whether an emotional stimulus can also retro-actively interrupt the ongoing processing of an earlier target. In two experiments, we examined whether the presentation of a negative emotionally arousing picture can disrupt working memory consolidation of a preceding visual target. In both experiments, the effects of negative emotional <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> compared with <b>the</b> effects of neutral pictures. In Experiment 1, <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> entirely task-irrelevant whereas in Experiment 2 <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -alternative forced choice task that required participants to respond to the color of a frame surrounding <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> did not interfere with target consolidation when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> task-irrelevant, whereas such interference <b>was</b> observed when <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> associated with a 2 -AFC task. Most importantly, however, the results showed no effects of whether <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> had neutral or emotional content. Implications for further research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E
5|$|On the Vandal side, <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> less clear. The Vandal {{army was}} not a {{professional}} and mostly volunteer force like the East Roman army, but comprised every able-bodied male of the Vandal people. Hence modern estimates on the available forces vary along with estimates on the total Vandal population, {{from a high of}} between 30,000–40,000 men out of a total Vandal population of at most 200,000 people (Diehl and Bury), to as few as 25,000 men—or even 20,000, if their losses against the Moors are taken into account—for a population base of 100,000 (Hughes). Despite their martial reputation, the Vandals had grown less warlike over time, having come to lead a luxurious life amidst the riches of Africa. In addition, their mode of fighting was ill-suited to confronting Belisarius' veterans: the Vandal army was composed exclusively of cavalry, lightly armoured and armed only for hand-to-hand combat, to the point of neglecting entirely the use of bows or javelins, in stark contrast to Belisarius' heavily armoured cataphracts and horse archers.|$|E
25|$|Other issues {{involving}} photojournalism include {{the right to}} privacy and the compensation of the news subject. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim's right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> printed without their knowledge or consent. The compensation of the subject is another issue. Subjects often want to be paid in order for the picture to be published, especially if <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> of a controversial subject.|$|E
