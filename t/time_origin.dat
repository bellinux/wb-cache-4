5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The <b>time</b> <b>origin</b> was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E
25|$|Without {{an actual}} comb one {{can look at}} the phase vs frequency. Without a carrier–envelope offset all {{frequencies}} are cosines. This means that all frequencies have the phase zero. The <b>time</b> <b>origin</b> is arbitrary. If a pulse comes at later times, the phase increases linearly with frequency, but still the zero-frequency phase is zero. This phase at zero frequency is the carrier–envelope offset. The second harmonic not only has twice the frequency, but also twice the phase. Thus for a pulse with zero offset the second harmonic of the low-frequency tail is in phase with the fundamental of the high-frequency tail, and otherwise it is not. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) measures how the phase increases with frequency, but it cannot determine the offset, so the name “electric field reconstruction” is a bit misleading.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, this {{approach}} supports the constraint {{of the time}} at which the tsunami originates. In previous examinations, we assumed that the <b>time</b> of <b>origin</b> of the tsunami is known {{for the purpose of}} comparing O(r_i,t) and C(r_i,t). However, the <b>time</b> of <b>origin</b> is unknown during a real-time tsunami forecast. As shown in the first line of Table  2, comparisons based on the time shift τ are consistent with searches for the <b>time</b> of <b>origin.</b> The best-matched case (τ = 0  min) provides a well-matched scenario for the time at which the tsunami originated. This examination enables us to confirm that the time at which the tsunami originated could be estimated by the time-shifted comparisons using multiple indices.|$|R
