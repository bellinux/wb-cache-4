From approximately 2. 5 percent in 1984, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education increased to approximately 5 percent by 1993. During that period, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience fell. Though women have higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, <b>returns</b> for men increased more across regime change.
