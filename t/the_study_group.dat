5|$|Jeff Winger, a disbarred lawyer, has {{enrolled}} at Greendale Community College {{as a condition}} for getting his license back. His plan is to use his friendship with Dr. Ian Duncan to obtain test answers. In the cafeteria Jeff meets the attractive Britta, and (in an attempt to get closer to her) convinces her to join his non-existent Spanish study group. As <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> convenes, Jeff pretends the other members simply did not show up. Britta, however, has invited Abed to join them. Jeff unsuccessfully tries to make him leave, and then gets called to the football field by Dr. Duncan. The professor makes a futile attempt to appeal to Jeff's conscience, and eventually agrees to provide the answers. Jeff returns to <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group,</b> discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce and Annie. Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
5|$|The glee club instructor, Mr. Rad (Taran Killam), invites <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> to join {{and perform}} the Christmas pageant but is rebuffed {{promptly}} {{due to their}} collective dislike for the club. However, {{through a series of}} events performed as songs, the members of the group are lured into joining the club one by one.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order. He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group.</b> As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E

Their conversation is interrupted by a performance by the obnoxious Greendale glee club. Midway through, Chang (Ken Jeong) stops them with a cease and desist order from ASCAP—tipped off by Jeff (Joel McHale)—for performing copyrighted music without permission. The glee club members suffer a nervous breakdown and are taken to the hospital.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Danqun Fang {{found that the}} {{sensitivity}} of EEG and ECG was quite low when doing research for physiological effects of noise. By using Biocybernetics theory, he proposed a series of new indicators of heart and brain function evaluation system together with experts of different professions, and proposed the linear relationship between the heart, brain function and noise level. It concerned research of noise physiological effect, especially with computer analysis of noise influence on heart and brain. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> had enrolled a number of doctors and successfully developed differential diagnosis systems of heart EEG and ECG Multiphase Information, which increased the diagnostic sensitivity of coronary heart disease up to 85%.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Preparatory Commission for the Second Vatican Council, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre had taken part in the discussions about the draft {{documents}} submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council. His concerns with these proposals {{led to the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> to deal with a number of issues at the Council. A primary element of their agenda was opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, which they feared could undermine papal primacy and the rights of individual bishops. They thought there should be a specific condemnation of communism and that there should be a separate Council document elevating the status of the Blessed Virgin Mary, not merely a chapter in Lumen gentium.|$|E
25|$|Arterial damage {{results from}} {{white blood cell}} {{invasion}} and inflammation within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, {{so it can be}} used as a very rough proxy for heart disease risk. Since many things can cause elevated CRP, this is not a very specific prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, a level above 2.4mg/L has been associated with a doubled risk of a coronary event compared to levels below 1mg/L; however, <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> in this case consisted of patients who had been diagnosed with unstable angina pectoris; whether elevated CRP has any predictive value of acute coronary events in the general population of all age ranges remains unclear.

25|$|Several {{critics and}} {{scientists}} {{have expressed concern}} that the nature of the main couple's relationship is not BDSM at all, but rather is characteristic of an abusive relationship. In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein the books were read by multiple professionals and assessed for characteristics of intimate partner violence, or IPV, using the CDC's standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.|$|E
25|$|Early {{urban renewal}} efforts in St. Louis coincided with efforts {{to plan a}} riverfront {{memorial}} to honor Thomas Jefferson, which would later include the famous Gateway Arch. Starting in the early 1910s, St. Louis businessman Luther Ely Smith had pushed for a riverfront rehabilitation project to promote green spaces and better living conditions near the wharf. In December 1933, St. Louis Mayor Bernard Dickmann formed a group to promote Smith's project {{on a national level}} as both a renewal project and a memorial. The lobbying proved successful, as in 1934, Congress formed a commission to plan the project, which first met in December 1934 in St. Louis. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> heard a preliminary proposal from Louis Labeaume of the St. Louis chapter of the American Institute of Architects, in which a memorial would be constructed on land cleared south of the Eads Bridge by half a mile, extending from the riverfront to Third Street, which would encompass the entire area of the original village of St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A larger study, consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group,</b> 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term.

25|$|On 12 May 2009, the French {{overseas}} Minister, Yves Jégo, {{at the end}} {{of these}} conferences, made an official visit to les Saintes for the seminary of the southern islands of Guadeloupe. He took into account the identical reality and the political hopes of these islands, to improve the territorial continuity, to reduce the effects of the double-insularity, the abolition of the dependence to Guadeloupe, national representation, the development of the attractiveness of the labour pool in the zone, the fight against the depopulation, the tax system and the expensive life. For the moment he announced the signature of a contract baptised COLIBRI ("hummingbird"; Contract for the Employment and the Local Initiatives in the Regional Pond of the Southern Islands of Guadeloupe), a convention of the Grouping of Public Interest for Arrangement and Development (GIPAD) and a proposition of statutory evolution in final, like <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> of governance, the collective of the southern islands of Guadeloupe and the elected representatives asked it, {{on the basis of the}} article 74 of the French constitution.|$|E
25|$|From the IAC {{minutes of}} December 4 and the earlier CIA {{documents}} it appears {{clear that the}} Robertson Panel was the outcome of recommendation (a) of the IAC decision but that this formed part of a wider intended programme of action aimed at enabling rapid positive identification of UFOs from an air defense perspective (i.e. identifying actual Soviet aircraft from misidentified natural phenomena or other conventional objects) {{and a desire to}} reduce reporting of UFOs, which were seen as clogging up air defense communication channels and created the risk of exploitation of this effect. The inter-relationships between these wider aspects of the CIA’s recommendations and the Battelle Memorial Institute's study, culminating in Blue Book Special Report 14, which identified a statistically significant difference between 'unknowns' and UFO reports that could subsequently be identified, or <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> referenced in a Canadian government document as operating as early as 1950 under the chairmanship of Dr Vannevar Bush, then head of the Joint Research and Development Board, to discover the ‘modus operandi’ of UFOs are unclear.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>group</b> consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E
