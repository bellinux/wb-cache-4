Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E

30|$|The voltage {{is closely}} related with {{reactive}} power, thus the wind turbines with <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of controlling reactive power can support system voltage control. As indicated in grid codes, large wind farms are required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of controlling both active and reactive power. The simplest way of controlling reactive power is to use switched capacitor banks.|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned by Lee et al. [15], the major limitation of vNOTES is {{the inability to}} overview the pelvicarea, in particular the vesico-uterine pouch, and thus lesions such as bladder endometriosis or anterior uterine wall myomas can be missed. Innovation of endoscopes is desirable to overcome this limitation and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> with vNOTES <b>to</b> explore the entire abdominal cavity.|$|R
30|$|Many {{training}} {{programs aimed at}} future entrepreneurs teach what is typical for large corporations while neglect what is essential. During {{the initial stages of}} the life cycle it is more relevant for <b>the</b> owner-manager <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> that would enable him/her to find out new opportunities, do, buy and sell a product than to know how to step-by-step structure a formal strategy plan.|$|R

25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{is one of}} the four {{dimensions}} of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued the concepts of locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy and self-esteem measured the same, single factor.|$|E

25|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by eosinophil-induced inflammation motivated by a type 2 helper T cell (Th2). By targeting the transcription factor, GATA3, of the Th2 pathway, with DNAzyme {{it may be possible}} to negate the inflammation. The safety and efficacy of SB010, a novel 10-23 DNAzyme was evaluated, and found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cleave and inactivate GATA3 messenger RNA in phase IIa clinical trials. Treatment with SB010 significantly offset both late and early asthmatic responses after allergen aggravation in male patients with allergic asthma.|$|E
25|$|Canalipalpata worms often {{lose one}} or more radioles, or even the entire crown {{as a result of}} {{predation}} by other animals or other types of trauma. Some species even appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> control the loss of their tentacular crowns, in much the same manner as when a lizard loses its tail. In certain circumstances, sacrifice of the crown may permit escape or confer some other benefit to the animal. Separation of the crown occurs at a pre-established zone of abscission, located {{at the base of the}} crown.|$|E
25|$|A nat is {{a spirit}} or god who resembles a human in shape that often {{maintains}} or guards objects. When people die, {{they can become}} nats. Those who become nats often have a gruesome violent death which explains their vengeful nature. Nats also are believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> possess animals, such as tigers or alligators. These spirits {{can also be found}} in nature in things such as trees and rocks. The majority of these nats are viewed as troublesome and irritable. They require calming, food and offerings.|$|E
50|$|Baraka {{is not a}} state, it is a flow of blessings and grace. It {{flows from}} God to those that are closest to God, such as saints and prophets. Those that have {{received}} baraka are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> perform miracles (karamat), such as thought-reading, healing the sick, flying, and reviving the dead. However, according to Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri, a prominent Sufi mystic, {{the use of these}} miracles and the actual possession of these abilities are not indicative of a saint's status, however, the performance of these miracles by prophets is important to establish credentials.|$|R
5|$|Polyploidy appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{enhanced}} <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{of flowering}} plants {{to survive the}} extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|R

25|$|A TEM {{stage is}} {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hold a specimen and be manipulated {{to bring the}} region of interest {{into the path of}} the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several μm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers. Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using screw gearing in concert with stepper motors, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a joystick or trackball.|$|E
25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{throttle}} down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the lunar orbit insertion (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage {{was designed to be}} powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.|$|E
