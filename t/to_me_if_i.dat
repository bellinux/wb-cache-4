500|$|In {{the first}} scene {{featuring}} Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, comedian Steve Love was cast {{as one of the}} Brotherhood members killed by the Hound. Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what your plans are for me but it would really mean a lot <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{sometimes}} {{portrayed as}} a Satanist by the media, Danzig has denied this in several interviews, elaborating that [...] "I embrace both my light and dark side... I definitely believe in a yin and yang, good and evil. My religion is a patchwork of whatever is real <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> can draw the strength {{to get through the}} day from something, that's religion... I'm not trying to be preachy or tell people what to think." [...] Danzig has voiced his approval of certain aspects of Satanic ideologies, including the quest for knowledge and individual freedom. He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts. He wrote on the cover of a script: [...] "I'm not going out on a limb for this show because I'm not in accord with what you're (Freiberger) doing as a result... etc. I don't think I even want to do the promos—I don't want to push the show any more as I have in the past. It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not so," [...] said Fahni; [...] "go, my children, that I may live. Go {{and gather}} the tribe, all the {{thousands}} of them who are men and can fight, and bring them up to attack Asiki-land, <b>to</b> rescue <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> still live, or <b>to</b> avenge <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am dead. As for these bearers, do them no harm, but send them on to the coast with the white man's goods." ...|$|R
60|$|SENTINEL. He will {{do worse}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> disobey my officer. Stand back.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Number two, Pa, {{is much to}} {{the same}} purpose, though not so preposterous. Mr Lightwood would propose <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would let him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{could not}} quite leave off believing the dreadful things Mr. Maddox and Maria said they would do <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> told." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{did not say}} we've {{internally}} appointed (Chee-hwa Tung). You want <b>to</b> ask <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> support Mr. Tung, I said I support him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing. 'I {{should not}} allow any one <b>to</b> {{inconvenience}} <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could hinder it--walk in!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An insolent gypsy woman, {{wife of the}} man {{who stole}} the fowls. She had the impudence <b>to</b> {{threaten}} <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> appeared against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nick {{broke into}} a laugh. [...] "It would have {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> understood a little better--!" [...] But he paused, as still too amused.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} your confession," [...] she said. [...] "I wonder {{whether it would}} cure you of your unhappy {{attachment}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> made mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not--I hope not. But you {{are beyond}} such influences. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> may say so, {{that you are}} beyond all influences." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} Hayes studied Kit, who looked quietly resolute. Then he said, [...] "You are {{determined}} <b>to</b> oppose <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't consent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beseech {{you not to}} insist, Monsieur. M. le Chevalier has sworn <b>to</b> dismiss <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> permit you <b>to</b> {{set foot}} within the château." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. He {{has been}} good enough <b>to</b> amuse <b>me</b> with mysterious threats as to {{what he would do}} <b>to</b> punish <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would not--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} have {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not seen something like it done elsewhere--at Middleton lately," [...] he said, thoughtfully, after a while.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Shame thee?" [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "Would any baron of mine kneel <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were witless, discrowned, and alone, and Harold had my throne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I'm {{up against}} it," [...] he growled, {{taking a step}} forward. [...] "I'll have {{something}} of what's coming <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> swing for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then you'll refuse <b>to</b> believe <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{confess that}} it was this grace and beauty that {{determined}} my destiny that day by urging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join your father's troupe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{want you}} <b>to</b> help <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did?" [...] Mrs. Sowler asked contemptuously. [...] "They may be both dead and buried, for all I know to the contrary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems like I've {{got some}} push <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do it, don't it?" [...] Master Plummer replied, complacently, {{and there the}} {{conversation}} came to an end.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, {{of course}} I 'm {{afraid of what}} he might do <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to leave him; he can be so very violent.|$|E

6000|$|... “Upon my word,” he said, {{recovering}} {{his usual}} bearing. “It looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had been asked}} there only for the daughter to talk to me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him to give}} it to her--he knows who--and--and--say it {{has kept}} me in--in heaven when {{sometimes}} it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had got into hell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What right {{have you}} to tell me to give it up? What would you say <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to declare that George Roden should be given up?" ...|$|E
