5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, {{the objects of}} <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region {{is less than the}} distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E

5|$|In addition, most {{solar panels}} on {{spacecraft}} are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System also {{contains}} near-Earth asteroids, {{many of which}} cross the orbits of the inner planets. Some of them are potentially hazardous objects.|$|E
2500|$|Eighth Men. [...] "These long-headed and {{substantial}} folk {{were designed to}} be strictly pedestrian, physically and mentally."

50|$|Atmospheric escape {{is largely}} a thermal process. The {{atmosphere}} a body can retain therefore varies from <b>the</b> warmer <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, to <b>the</b> cooler outer regions. Different bodies in different Solar System regions provide analogous or contrasting examples. The atmosphere of Titan is considered analogous to an early, colder Earth; the atmosphere of Pluto is considered analogous to an enormous comet.|$|R

5|$|Earth and its {{neighbor}} planets may have formed from fragments of planets after collisions with Jupiter destroyed those super-Earths near the Sun. As Jupiter came toward <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, in what theorists call the Grand Tack Hypothesis, gravitational tugs and pulls occurred causing {{a series of}} collisions between the super-Earths as their orbits began to overlap.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit, and 2215BC may have been its first passage through <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
40|$|Regolith breccias are lithified {{samples of}} the {{regolith}} that have been fused together by impact shock and thermal metamorphism. In lunar regolith samples, the ratio of trapped 40 Ar/ 36 Ar is a useful indicator of antiquity {{and can be used}} to model the closure age/lifithication event of the regolith (i. e. the apparent time when Ar became trapped [1]), thus providing an important insight into specific times when that regolith was interacting with <b>the</b> <b>the</b> dynamic <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system space environment [2 - 4]...|$|R
40|$|The Stardust sample-return {{mission has}} {{provided}} researchers with {{a glimpse of}} conditions in the early solar system, {{in the form of}} cometary dust with a surprising range of compositions. Some grains arose in <b>the</b> hot <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system, others in the cooler outer reaches where comets accrete. There are also grains that formed before the Sun itself. In all, the samples so far have raised as many questions as they have answered, but together they suggest that the early solar system was probably a more complex place than had been supposed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, {{and oxygen}} isotopic {{compositions}} are heterogeneous among comet 81 P/Wild 2 particle fragments, however extreme isotopic anomalies are rare, {{indicating that the}} comet is not a pristine aggregate of presolar materials. Non-terrestrial nitrogen and neon isotope ratios suggest that indigenous organic matter and highly volatile materials were successfully collected. Except for a single circumstellar stardust grain, silicate and oxide minerals have oxygen isotopic compositions consistent with solar system origin. One refractory grain is {sup 16 }O-enriched like refractory inclusions in meteorites, suggesting formation in <b>the</b> hot <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> nebula and large-scale radial transport prior to comet accretion in the outer solar system...|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's equatorial plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System's history.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{conjecture}} {{that the}} matter composing the Oort cloud formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution. Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, {{it may be the}} source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System.|$|E
50|$|There was {{a series}} of five video documentaries {{entitled}} Encyclopædia Galactica in 1993, with <b>the</b> titles “The <b>Inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System”, “The Outer Solar System”, “Star Trekking”, “Discovery”, and “Astronomy and the Stars”. The videos were produced by York Films of England and distributed by Encyclopædia Britannica (Australia). Other entities associated with the production of the video series were Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corporation, The Learning Channel, The Discovery Channel Europe, S4C Wales, System TV France and Yleisradio Finland.|$|R
40|$|Maps of crustal {{thickness}} {{derived from}} NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission revealed more large impact basins on the nearside hemisphere of the Moon than on its farside. The enrichment in heat-producing elements and prolonged volcanic {{activity on the}} lunar nearside hemisphere indicate that {{the temperature of the}} nearside crust and upper mantle was hotter than that of the farside at the time of basin formation. Using the iSALE- 2 D hydrocode to model impact basin formation, we found that impacts on the hotter nearside would have formed basins up to two times larger than similar impacts on the cooler farside hemisphere. The size distribution of lunar impact basins is thus not representative of <b>the</b> earliest <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> system impact bombardment...|$|R
40|$|Mars {{appears to}} be {{deficient}} in large craters relative to Mercury and the Moon. This relative deficiency conflicts with the interpretation of a common population of impactors within <b>the</b> early <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system and suggest either of two possibilities. If the apparent deficiency of martian craters is real then the population of impactors at Mars differed significantly from that closer to the Sun. If the apparent deficiency is not real then the complete crater inventory of Mars should be {{similar to those of}} Mercury and the Moon, supporting the interpretation of a single population of impactors. These alternate possibilities can be tested by comparing revised inventories that include partly buried or eroded craters to an estimate of Mars' possible relative crater deficiency...|$|R
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Halley's {{returns to}} <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System have been {{observed}} and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.|$|E
5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> warmer <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System, planetesimals {{formed from}} rocks and metals cooked {{billions of years}} ago in the cores of massive stars.These {{elements}} constituted only 0.6% of the material in the solar nebula. That is why the terrestrial planets could not grow very large and could not exert large pull on hydrogen and helium gas. Also, the faster collisions among particles close to the Sun were more destructive on average. Even if the terrestrial planets had had hydrogen and helium, the Sun would have heated the gases and caused them to escape. Hence, solar terrestrial planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are dense small worlds composed mostly from 2% of heavier elements contained in the solar nebula.|$|R

The digital polyphase filter bank spectrometer (PFB) offers broad bandwidth with high spectral resolution, minimal channel-to-channel overlap, and high out-of-band rejection...|$|R
5000|$|In {{stars with}} masses of 0.3-1.5 solar masses (...) , {{including}} the Sun, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton-proton chains, {{which do not}} establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> portion of <b>solar</b> mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.|$|R
5|$|O'Neill was {{appointed}} by United States President Ronald Reagan to the National Commission on Space in 1985. The commission, led by former NASA administrator Thomas Paine, proposed that the government commit to opening <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System for human settlement within 50 years. Their report was released in May 1986, {{four months after the}} Space Shuttle Challenger broke up on ascent.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared {{on the order of}} 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system until approximately 4385.|$|E
5|$|The {{interplanetary medium}} {{is home to}} at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>Solar</b> System and causes the zodiacal light. It was likely formed by {{collisions}} within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets. The second dust cloud extends from about 10AU to about 40AU, and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5000|$|Wasserburg {{was deeply}} {{involved}} in the Apollo Program with the [...] returned Lunar samples, including {{being a member of the}} so-called [...] "Four Horsemen", along with Bob Walker, Jim Arnold, and Paul Werner Gast. He pioneered the precise measurement of ultra-small samples under strict clean room conditions with minimal contamination. He was the co-inventor of the Lunatic Spectrometer (the first fully digital mass spectrometer with computer-controlled magnetic field scanning & rapid switching) and founder of the [...] "Lunatic Asylum" [...] research laboratory at Caltech specializing in high precision, high sensitivity isotopic analyses of meteorites, lunar and terrestrial samples. He and his co-workers were major contributors to establishing a chronology for the Moon and proposed the hypothesis of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) of <b>the</b> whole <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system at near 4.0 Gy ago (with F.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{existence of}} lunar volatiles is a scientific discovery that could distinctly change {{the direction of}} pathways of <b>inner</b> <b>solar</b> system human expansion. With a dedicated germanium gamma ray spectrometer launched in the early 1990 's, surface water concentrations of 0. 7 percent could be detected immediately upon full lunar polar orbit operations. The expense of lunar base construction and operation would be dramatically reduced over a scenario with no lunar volatile resources. Global surface mineral distribution could be mapped out and integrated into a GIS database for lunar base site selection. Extensive surface lunar mapping would also result in the utilization of archived Apollo images. A variety of remote sensing systems and their parameters have been proposed {{for use in the}} detection of these lunar ice masses. The detection or nondetection of subsurface and surface ice masses in lunar polar crater floors could dramatically direct the development pathways that the human race might follow in its radiation from the Earth to habitable locales in <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> terran <b>solar</b> system. Potential sources of lunar volatiles are described. The use of remote sensing to detect lunar volatiles is addressed...|$|R
