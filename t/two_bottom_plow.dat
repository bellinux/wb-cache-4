5000|$|All modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter-feeders {{which have}} baleen {{in place of}} teeth, though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species (gulp-feeding within balaenopterids, skim-feeding within balaenids, and <b>bottom</b> <b>plowing</b> within eschrichtiids). the first members of both groups {{appeared}} during the middle Miocene. Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources, which makes the large body size in modern variety possible.

A large-scale change in ocean current and temperature could have contributed to the radiation of modern mysticetes. The earlier variety of baleen whales, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", such as Janjucetus and Mammalodon had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth.|$|R
