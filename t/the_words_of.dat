5|$|In a {{collaboration}} with Kliment Voroshilov, Molotov contributed both musically and lyrically to the 1944 {{version of the}} Soviet national anthem. Molotov asked the writers to include a line or two about peace. Molotov's and Voroshilov's role {{in the making of}} the new Soviet anthem was, in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, acting as music judges for Stalin.|$|E

5|$|The Quran is {{the central}} {{religious}} text of Islam. Muslims believe it represents <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> God revealed by the archangel Gabriel to Muhammad.

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was filmed and {{released}} in 2000. Filmed inside a nightclub, the video begins with Durand entering the stage while simultaneous images of the band using instruments appear. Durand then {{stands in front of}} a microphone, preparing for an upcoming verse. Various shots of an audience, background dancers and singers, and trumpet performers are also shown. After the second chorus, the clip focuses on Durand, who is now mouthing some of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the song; the final chorus resumes the simultaneous images setup.|$|E

50|$|In Christianity, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> {{wisdom is}} a spiritual gift listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8. The {{function}} that this gift is given varies.

5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's {{translation of the}} biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition {{as he had done}} with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E

Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} the arteries to veins, claiming it reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo words or phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Antex Publishing of Lexington {{released}} Farmer's autobiography entitled Richie. In {{addition to}} the standard printing, the publisher offered {{a special edition of}} the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type, similar to <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Jesus in red letter editions of the Bible. Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book's foreword. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing from the publisher was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|In 1833, Smith {{received}} the revelation known as <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom, {{part of which}} prohibits the consumption of alcohol, {{with the exception of}} sacramental wine. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom was treated as a recommendation, and the early Latter Day Saints would still drink alcohol on occasion. During the late-19th century, church leaders began to interpret <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom as a mandatory requirement for members. This increased respect for <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom, combined with other scriptures in Doctrine and Covenants led congregations to begin substituting water for the sacramental wine. The practice was officially adopted church-wide in 1912.|$|R

5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> {{the first line of}} the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|In the Gospel of Luke <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Magnificat are {{spoken by}} Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation. It is a chosen {{opportunity}} {{to give more}} than ordinary attention to the Magnificat canticle in liturgy, while the feast celebrates the event tied to its origin.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the phrase}} [...] "the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> God" [...] is never {{applied to the}} modern Bible within the Bible itself, {{supporters}} of inerrancy argue that {{this is because the}} biblical canon was not closed. In , the apostle Paul wrote to the church in Thessalonica [...] "when you received <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> men, but as it is in truth, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God".|$|R

25|$|In a {{pamphlet}} written in 1930 called <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom, apostle John A. Widtsoe taught that refined flour was contrary to <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom. <b>The</b> church, however, has never prohibited {{the use of}} refined flour.|$|R
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scholars}} have emphasised, in <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Ármann Jakobsson, that:the {{time has come}} to resist reviewing information about álfar en masse and trying to impose generalizations on a tradition of a thousand years. Legends of álfar may have been constantly changing and were perhaps always heterogeneous so it might be argued that any particular source will only reflect the state of affairs at one given time.Thus, elves have had a place both within and outside Germanic-speaking Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> a chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E
