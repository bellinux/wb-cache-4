5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a <b>tetherball).</b> The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a <b>tetherball).</b> The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, 2012, Pier 5 officially opened. Pier 5 {{consists}} of three athletic fields, two playgrounds and a picnic area, costing $26 million to develop the 5 acre site. The athletic fields are made of synthetic turf and will predominantly be used for soccer and can also accommodate lacrosse, cricket, rugby and ultimate Frisbee. The fields {{will be available for}} youth and adult leagues, as well as for private and public schools. St. Francis College will host its Division I men's soccer home games at Pier 5 beginning in 2013. The first Division I game at Pier 5 was held on September 10, 2013, as the St. Francis Terriers hosted and defeated the St. Peter's University Peacocks 3-1. The inland portion of Pier 5 features 2 playgrounds and 57 picnic tables along with two dozen grills scattered around the picnic area. There are also <b>tetherball</b> courts and a child-size telescope.|$|E
50|$|Mark Leyner is {{the author}} of My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist; Tooth Imprints on a Corn Dog; I Smell Esther Williams; Et Tu Babe; and The <b>Tetherballs</b> of Bougainville. He has written scripts for a variety of films and {{television}} shows. His writing appears regularly in The New Yorker, Time and GQ.|$|R
50|$|Leyner employs {{an intense}} and {{unconventional}} style in his works of fiction. His stories are generally humorous and absurd: In The <b>Tetherballs</b> of Bougainville, Mark's father survives a lethal injection {{at the hands}} of the New Jersey penal system, and so is freed but must live the remainder of his life in fear of being executed, at New Jersey's discretion, in any situation and regardless of collateral damage. They frequently incorporate elements of meta-fiction: In the same novel, an adolescent Mark produces a film adaptation of the story of his father's failed execution, although he reads a newspaper review of the movie to the prison's warden, and then dies, before even leaving the prison. At the sentence level, Leyner uses sprawling imagery and an extravagant vocabulary, bordering on prose poetry.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{starts with}} Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announcing to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that she needs}} to go to Chicago for jury duty because she is still {{registered}} to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful sedative for the trip. Later, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in <b>tetherball,</b> Tyler Brody (Remy Auberjonois). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and is threatening to go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic <b>tetherball</b> competition during the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. To keep him quiet, Jack tells him that he can [...] "be the voice of Knight Rider" [...] in a film adaptation, which Tyler considers. Afterwards, Kenneth tells Jack that he [...] "lost two heroes today", as he looked up to both Jack and Tyler. As a result, Jack wants to be in Kenneth's good side, but wants to break his moral absolutism, after Kenneth did not hesitate to attempt to kill himself when he believed the air in a stalled elevator was about to run out. Jack finally succeeds when he supplies Kenneth with a big screen television, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "is supposed to be terrifying".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{commented that}} California Chrome {{appears to be}} a very {{intelligent}} horse, as he expresses curiosity about everything around him. His idiosyncrasies, included a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies. [...] His tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason, particularly when being bathed, prompted the press to claim that he is [...] "smiling". He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to [...] "pose" [...] for cameras when he hears them clicking. As Alan Sherman explained, [...] "He's a ham"; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname, [...] "Vogue". As a younger horse, notably in 2014, he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit; he would only back out, a quirk discovered by the press when he was first unloaded off of an airplane. At the Sherman stables, he had a green <b>tetherball</b> in his stall to play with, but his worst bad habit is that he sometimes bites.|$|E
500|$|Streisand {{takes them}} to her condo in the mountains, where she ties the boys up and tortures them with her singing voice. Cartman relents and gives up the {{triangle}}. Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure [...] for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play <b>tetherball</b> and gets strangled by the rope. Actor Sidney Poitier arrives and turns into a giant fanged turtle to fight Mecha-Striesand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting {{a call from the}} boys and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature.|$|E

50|$|In the {{differential}} geometry of curves, an involute (also known as evolvent) is a curve obtained from another given curve by attaching an imaginary taut string to the given curve and tracing its free end {{as it is}} wound onto that given curve; or in reverse, unwound. It is a roulette wherein the rolling curve is a straight line containing the generating point. For example, an involute approximates the path followed by a <b>tetherball</b> as the connecting tether is wound around the center pole. If the center pole has a circular cross-section, then the curve is an involute of a circle.|$|E

50|$|Nano-tetherball Sensor is one {{of newly}} {{discovered}} methods in detecting glucose in the human body.

Despite the many opto/electronic mechanisms on the market, from a physical and chemical point of view, the nanomachine optical fiber provides many advantages over the other types.|$|E
50|$|These {{advantages}} include its remote in-situ {{or actual}} detection; its wavelength {{has the highest}} degree of selectivity, with high information competence and analysis with multi-channels of wide capacity for detecting reagents that are non-responsive in electrical structures.
