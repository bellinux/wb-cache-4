5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.|$|E

5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt {{in any way that}} he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham played fifth-placed Blackpool in the {{play-off}} semi-final. The {{match was}} played over two legs, {{the first leg}} being played at the ground of the lower-placed team. Birmingham lost the first leg 1–0, to a Tom Ince shot deflected past Colin Doyle by Curtis Davies. In the second leg, {{in front of a}} 28,483 sell-out crowd, Blackpool scored either side of half <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 aggregate lead before Birmingham staged a fightback, with goals from Nikola Žigić and Davies, but were unable to score the necessary third goal to take the tie into extra time.|$|E
25|$|Yang Yi Ru is a {{workaholic}} {{who never had}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break. Her family and friends decided to pull a prank on her to slow her down. They conned her into believing she only had six months to live, then packed her off to a vacation spot to clear her mind. She spent her first day on a sunny beach lamenting to a stranger that {{she wished she had}} the time to meet Mr. Right, get married and have kids. Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a man from her past who was in love with her when they met years ago.

500|$|John Quincy Adams {{concluded}} in 1821 that [...] "Calhoun {{is a man}} of fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted." [...] Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, [...] "Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> sectional position—later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after {{finishing}} the world tour {{in support of}} their sixth studio album Hail to the Thief (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we’d {{come to the end}} of our contract, which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you've achieved as a band." [...] Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke worked on his first solo album, The Eraser (2006), and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood composed his first soundtracks, for Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007).|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{returned}} to the studio in March 2004 to begin working on their second album A Beautiful Lie, with Josh Abraham producing. During the recording process, the band traveled to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto's acting career. A Beautiful Lie was notably different from the band's debut album, from both musical and lyrical aspect. [...] "On the first record I created a world, then hid behind it," [...] Leto said. [...] "With A Beautiful Lie, it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change. It's an incredibly intimate look into a life {{that is in the}} crossroads. A raw emotional journey. A story of life, love, death, pain, joy, and passion. Of {{what it is to be}} human." ...|$|E
30|$|Using a more {{advanced}} system, also ‘collision detection’ can be implemented: the messages exchanged contain accurate data to estimate the trajectories of the different road users, to make a risk assessment of potential collision, and to warn the road users in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> appropriate action. In order to avoid {{a high number of}} “nuisance” warnings, high positional accuracy is required. The risk assessment can be made either at the vehicle, the roadside unit, or the VRU device.|$|R

500|$|On 20 May 1745, {{he and his}} hussars {{distinguished}} {{themselves with}} a daring nocturnal passage of an Austrian corps of 20,000 men. Zieten led the famous Zietenritt (Zietenride) around the enemy's lines to deliver the King's order to a distant detachment. Two weeks later, at Hohenfriedberg on 4 June, the Zieten Hussars distinguished themselves {{for the first time}} in a battle. A second victory in the Battle of Hennersdorf in November, the Zieten Hussars shadowed the enemy, waiting to pounce on them. [...] At Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the Austro-Saxons; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decisive part in the victory.

500|$|In {{the final}} at Eden Park, the Crusaders faced the Blues, who were heavy favourites. According to Crusaders' hooker Mark Hammett, [...] "If we'd been polled in that week, {{and had to}} give an honest answer, most of the boys, deep down, would {{probably}} have thought that the Blues would beat us." [...] The Crusaders were ahead 3–0 at half time, but the Blues scored first after half <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 10–3 lead after 53 minutes. After Crusader Norm Maxwell scored a try, the game was tied 10 all. Then, after a penalty each, the two teams were tied 13 all with one minute of regulation time remaining. At that moment, Andrew Mehrtens chipped the ball for James Kerr to run onto and score, giving the Crusaders a 20–13 win after the try was converted. The ten points scored by Andrew Mehrtens in the final contributed to his total of 206 points for the season − a record for the Super 12. Upon the Crusaders' return to Christchurch, {{they were given a}} parade through the city that drew 100,000 people.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a black Spider-Man was first {{discussed}} {{a few months before}} the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, [...] "When we were planning [...] "Ultimatum," [...] we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> good look at one of our icons." [...] This new Spider-Man would replace Parker as Spider-Man only in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint whose storyline is set in a universe separate from the mainstream Marvel universe, in which Marvel's characters were reimagined for a 21st century audience. The replacement of Ultimate Peter Parker was considered as a possible part of the 2008–09 [...] "Ultimatum" [...] story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe, but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed. When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline [...] "", the character Miles Morales was created. Although Morales is the first black Spider-Man, he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider-Man identity. Miguel O'Hara, who is of half Mexican descent, was the title character in the 1990s series Spider-Man 2099.|$|E

In 2004, British television network Channel 4 (in a poll conducted on its website) awarded it [...] "27th Best Comedy Sketch Of All Time". Walters said [...] "she [...] knows I like playing old women. Why? Because I am one! I love {{the shape of}} them." ...|$|R
60|$|After various {{experiments}} with different climates, {{including that of}} Switzerland, Stevenson sailed for America in August 1887. The winter of 1887-88 he spent at Saranac Lake, {{under the care of}} Dr. Trudeau, who became one of his best friends. In 1890 he settled at Samoa in the Pacific. Here he entered upon a career of intense literary activity, and yet found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> active part in the politics of the island, and to give valuable assistance in internal improvements.|$|R

2500|$|A skilled batsman {{can use a}} {{wide array}} of [...] "shots" [...] or [...] "strokes" [...] in both {{defensive}} and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an [...] "edge". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply [...] "blocking" [...] the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., [...] "cut", [...] "drive", [...] "hook", [...] "pull".|$|E
2500|$|After {{three more}} defeats from winning positions, {{culminating}} in a 5–4 loss to Genk when 4–2 ahead with 20 minutes left, Brugge dismissed manager Adrie Koster. For Birmingham, Pablo made his first appearance since suffering concussion. The visitors took the lead with five minutes remaining in the first half. From a Víctor Vázquez corner, Thomas Meunier had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> touch before shooting past the player on the post from eight yards out. Soon afterwards, Beausejour gave away the ball in midfield and Vadis Odjidja crossed to Akpala who scored from an arguably offside position. Žigić's 55th-minute blocked shot rebounded to Beausejour who controlled well and lashed it back past the goalkeeper to reduce the deficit. After 66 minutes, Birmingham made a triple substitution, bringing on Burke, King and Wood for Elliott, Rooney and Žigić. The equaliser came eight minutes later; Ryan Donk fouled Beausejour just inside the area and Marlon King converted the penalty. The ball struck the woodwork three times: midway through the first half from Murphy's free kick {{on the edge of}} the area; just after the third goal, from Odjidja's curling [...] shot; and just before the equalising goal, Vladan Kujović, given his debut in place of Colin Coosemans, [...] "sensationally tipping Guirane N'daw's thunderous volley against an upright".|$|E
50|$|A {{technician}} {{places a}} catheter into {{the nose and}} then guides it into the stomach. Once placed in the stomach lining, the catheter is slowly withdrawn, allowing it to detect pressure changes and to record information for later review. The patient will be asked at <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> deep breath or <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some swallows of water. The degree of discomfort varies among patients. Patients are not sedated because sedatives would alter {{the functioning of the}} esophageal muscles. Overall the procedure takes about 45 minutes.
