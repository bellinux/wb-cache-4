40|$|This article {{considers}} s 281 of the Criminal Code (WA), {{which was}} introduced in 2008 to create an offence of unlawful assault causing death and to exclude the defence of accident (and the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> reasonable <b>foreseeability)</b> in those cases. The author argues that, given the ‘unfixed’ state of the common law of criminal causation in Australia, triers of fact may still consider the reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> <b>of</b> consequences in deciding the primary question of causation. If triers of fact may still have regard to the reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> <b>of</b> consequences in deciding causation as a separate issue, then s 281 might not achieve what {{it is intended to}} achieve. An accused might be acquitted of a charge of unlawful assault causing death on the basis that the death was not reasonably foreseeable even before the defence of accident arises. While this argument remains open, s 281 may be a vehicle for further appellate consideration of the law of criminal causation and the relationship of (legal) causation with accident in code jurisdictions...|$|R

5000|$|... "In {{its second}} aspect Hadley v Baxendale may be {{regarded}} as giving a grossly simplified {{answer to the question}} which its first aspect presents. To the question, how far shall we go in charging to the defaulting promisor the consequences of his breach, it answers with what purports to be a single test, that of foreseeability. The simplicity and comprehensiveness of this test are largely a matter of illusion. In the first place, it is openly branded as inappropriate in certain situations where the line is drawn much more closely in favor of the defaulting promisor than the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> as normally understood would draw it.' There are, therefore, exceptions to the test, to say nothing of authorities which reject it altogether as too burdensome to the defaulter. In the second place, {{it is clear that the}} <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> is less a definite test itself than a cover for a developing set of tests. As in the case of all [...] "reasonable man" [...] standards there is an element of circularity about the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability.</b> [...] "For what items of damage should the court hold the defaulting promisor? Those which he should as a reasonable man have foreseen. But what should he have foreseen as a reasonable man? Those items of damage for which the court feels he ought to pay." [...] The <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> is therefore subject to manipulation by the simple device of defining the characteristics of the hypothetical man who is doing the foreseeing. By a gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion this [...] "man" [...] acquires a complex personality; we begin to know just what [...] "he" [...] can [...] "foresee" [...] in this and that situation, and we end, not with one test but with a whole set of tests. This has obviously happened in the law of negligence, and it is happening, although less obviously, to the reasonable man postulated by Hadley v. Baxendale." ...|$|E

In the period 2001 - 2004, legislation has been passed in all Australian jurisdictions to effect “tort law reform”. This article outlines some of these changes, focusing particularly on the amendments to the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic), though it also draws attention to corresponding changes in other jurisdictions. The new legislation creates new immunities from liability; limits recovery for psychiatric injury; reintroduces in modified form the Bolam test of professional negligence; replaces the “not far-fetched or fanciful” <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> with one requiring that the risk be “not insignificant”; extends the scope of the traditional defence of voluntary assumption of risk; and provides caps, thresholds and a higher discount rate in relation to damages.

40|$|This note {{discusses}} a 2008 House of Lords {{decision on}} the proper test for remoteness of contractual damages following a breach of contract. In The Achilleas, Lord Hoffmann set out a test for remoteness which varied slightly from the traditional Hadley v Baxendale <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> entrenched in Common Law countries world-wide. Lord Hoffmann’s test draws on the broader context of an agreement, including {{whether there was a}} tacit assumption of risk by one of the parties, as well as standard norms in the industry in question. Although the Court was not unanimous in The Achilleas, this represents a significant departure from settled law. In South Africa, our Supreme Court of Appeal has favoured a ‘contemplation’ (foreseeability) test over a ‘convention’ (assumption of risk) one. In an important decision in 2001, however, this Court gave an obiter indication that it may also in future revise our foreseeability test in favour of a more flexible one, in line with other branches of the law of obligations. Lord Hoffmann’s decision is thus of relevance in demonstrating comparative trends in development of the law of remoteness of damage...|$|E
40|$|Copyright law’s {{principal}} justification {{today is}} the economic theory of creator incentives. Central to this theory is the recognition that while copyright’s exclusive rights framework provides creators with an economic incentive to create, it also entails large social costs, and that creators therefore need to be given just enough incentive to create in order to balance the system’s benefits against its costs. Yet, none of copyright’s current doctrines enable courts to circumscribe a creator’s entitlement by reference to limitations inherent in {{the very idea of}} incentives. While the common law too relies on providing actors with incentives to behave in certain ways, it recognizes that its incentive structure has outer limits and that failing to calibrate an entitlement or liability with these limits in mind is likely to prove inefficient. The principal mechanism that it employs to this end is the concept of foreseeability. Premised on the idea that individuals do not ordinarily consider consequences that are temporally or causally far removed from their actions, foreseeability allows courts to balance a regime’s ex ante incentive effects against its ex post costs when determining liability. This Article argues that if copyright law is to remain true to its theory of incentives, and thereby the need to balance monopoly control with the social costs that are central to the theory, it needs to internalize the idea that creators, like actors elsewhere, are incapable of fully anticipating all future contingencies associated with their actions, which in turn limits the effectiveness of incentives. To this end, this Article proposes a test of “foreseeable copying” to limit copyright’s grant of exclusivity to situations where a copier’s use was reasonably foreseeable at the time of creation — the point when the incentive is meant to operate. Adopting a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreseeability</b> is thus likely to better align copyright law with its underlying purpose and provide courts with a mechanism by which to give effect to copyright’s theory of incentives in individual cases — thereby according the theory more than just rhetorical significance...|$|E

40|$|Copyright law 2 ̆ 7 s {{principal}} justification has {{for long}} been the theory of creator incentives. Creators are presumed to be rational utility-maximizers and therefore induced to create by the mere prospect of controlling a future market for their yet-to-be-created works. Yet, current copyright doctrine does surprisingly little {{to give effect to}} this theory. None of its doctrines enable courts to circumscribe a creator 2 ̆ 7 s entitlement by reference to the idea of incentives and the limitations inherent therein. As a consequence, copyright 2 ̆ 7 s grant of exclusivity is presumed to extend to all markets and uses for a work, {{whether or not they were}} capable of forming any part of a creator 2 ̆ 7 s incentive. Limitless incentives thus translate into unbounded entitlements. Through its allocation of costs and benefits, the common law too relies on providing actors with incentives to behave in certain ways. Unlike copyright law however, the common law recognizes the existence of a clear outer limit to its incentive structure and attempts to give effect to this limit through the concept of 2 ̆ 2 foreseeability 2 ̆ 2. Premised on the idea that individuals are incapable of cognitively processing consequences that are temporally or causally far removed from their actions, foreseeability requires courts to eliminate from the liability calculus certain low-probability occurrences when they are unlikely to have influenced an individual 2 ̆ 7 s decision at the time of action. Foreseeability thus represents a cognition-based doctrinal limit to the behavioral modification that the common law attempts to induce. This Article argues that if copyright law is to remain true to its theory of incentives, it needs to pay closer attention to the way in which incentives actually influence creative decision-making and internalize the idea that creators, like actors elsewhere, are subject to cognitive imperfections that in turn limit the effectiveness of incentives. To this end, it proposes a test of 2 ̆ 2 foreseeable copying 2 ̆ 2 to limit copyright 2 ̆ 7 s grant of exclusivity to situations where a copier 2 ̆ 7 s use was reasonably foreseeable to the creator at the time of creation —the point when the incentive is meant to operate.

The resultant test for a duty of care - which remains good law today - {{can be found in the}} judgments of Caparo Industries plc v Dickman. A large criticism <b>of</b> the Anns <b>test</b> had been that it combined the <b>test</b> for proximity <b>of</b> relationship with <b>foreseeability</b> <b>of</b> harm.
