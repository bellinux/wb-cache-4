40|$|Thermoluminescence of non-irradiated natural quartz {{from various}} {{geological}} origins was studied. The difference of geological occurrences of quartz was detectable from their glow peaks and {{the origin of}} the difference was discussed from various data. ThermoIuminescence of gamma irradiated quartz from different geological origins was reported in the previous paper 9) and their glow curves were different in peak in-tensity and peak temperature depending on the geological occurrences of quartz. In this work, thermoluminescence of non-irradiated natural quartz from various geological origins was studied and the difference in the concentrations of different crystal imperfection is discussed. Quartz grains (100 - 200 meshes) were separated from various rocks by hand-pick-ing, heavy solution and magnetic method. The <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>apparatus</b> was the same as described in the previous report. 9) 80 mg of the sample powder was used for each measurement and the glow curve was recorded at the heating rate of about 90 °C/min to 450 °C. Quartz samples from volcanic rock, quartz porphyry or granite porphyry, granit...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{optimization}} of a heater used in a <b>Thermoluminescence</b> glow curve <b>apparatus.</b> Two variants of the heater, planchet system and block system, are described. Both variants performed by a cheap material as graphite and designed following cryogenic principles, are very simple constructively, ensure minimum heat losses and require lower power...|$|R
