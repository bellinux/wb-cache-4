His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to {{a transformer}} blowing out during the 2nd song which put <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> on auxiliary power making it unsafe for Spears and the entire production team to continue.

25|$|Frank Sinatra, who had {{declared}} Presley and {{rock and roll}} a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show. Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be $125,000 for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> but he agreed. The show, entitled “Welcome Home, Elvis”, was Presley's first national television appearance since The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1957.|$|E
25|$|French {{choreographer}} Sébastian Ramirez {{was hired}} from the dancer auditions, which saw over 5,000 applicants in Paris, New York and Los Angeles.

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> {{before an}} {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought {{it was very}} funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is too early for people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show.</b> In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designer}} Al Gurdon {{worked with}} Stufish and Tait Towers {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by PRG Group. The three main video screens were angled to give the side audience a better angle of vision. A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy Strobes. Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use the cameras and direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E

500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> and you would never know it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|In Pioneer Theatre Company's fall 1988 {{production}} of Anything Goes, Gaven played {{the lead role}} of nightclub singer Reno Sweeney. It is set on an ocean liner on which Reno helps the character Billy Crocker win {{the heart of the}} engaged Hope Harcourt who he has fallen in love with. While reviewing the musical for the Deseret News, Joseph Walker commented that Gaven [...] "is sensational as Reno Sweeney, the saucy, sassy hoofer-with-a-heart-of-gold. She has an arresting presence and a golden voice; <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> always seems better when she's on stage." [...] At the end of 1988, Gaven returned to the musical Oliver! in a Theatre Under The Stars production in Houston, starring as Nancy. A critic for the Houston Chronicle commended her performance, writing that she [...] "acts the compassionate Nancy with warmth and spirit, and sings in a strong voice full of character." ...|$|E

500|$|The 13th and 14th episodes ("Pillow Talk or Pillow Fight" [...] and [...] "Peaches Divided", respectively) {{garnered}} significant {{media attention}} for broadcasting physical altercations among {{several of the}} cast members. Leakes and Moore found themselves {{in the midst of}} a heated verbal argument, while Parks' husband Apollo Nida and Moore's assistant Brandon Deshazer engaged in a physical fight. Burruss was later angered by false allegations spread about Tucker and notably delivered the line, [...] "I will drag you in this, bitch!", as she was pulled away from the incident. Rodney Ho from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution acknowledged the situation as [...] "one of the most violent fights in the six-year history of the program", while Bailey commented on : [...] "I've been on this show for four years and never, ever in the history of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> has anyone laid hands on each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Scheduling {{the concert}} meant a {{financial}} loss of £500,000 for the band, despite sponsorship from Coca-Cola and GSM. Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 ( [...] , [...] ), {{because of the}} 50percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we {{felt it was important}} that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. To come here and not do <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> would have been rude." [...] According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation.|$|E
500|$|With filming {{beginning}} on May 21, 2007, [...] "It's Alive!" [...] marked the permanent relocation of production from Miami to Los Angeles. Five episodes {{of the first}} season were shot on location in Miami, which Cerone said was [...] "a bigger hassle than it was worth". Showtime programming chief Robert Greenblatt said that [...] "It just became impossible, production-wise, to shoot <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> [...] ", because of the overlap between Dexters production window and Florida's hurricane season, making property insurance costly. A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and filmed, according to producer Sara Colleton, [...] "a lot of pieces—not just Dexter walking {{in and out of}} his door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use", which the writers then worked into the episode and others. For the episode, Biscayne Bay was substituted with a set in Los Angeles, while most on location scenes were filmed in and around San Pedro and Long Beach, California.|$|E
