40|$|Background: The use of {{computer}} software and stereolithography for dental implant therapy has significantly increased {{during the last}} few years. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the mean accuracy and maximum deviations values of dental implant placement using two stereolithographic (SLA) guide systems. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients were selected and 227 implants were inserted using bone-, tooth- and mucosa-supported SLA surgical guides. Thirty-one guides, both single- and multiple-type, were used. Some of the single-type surgical guides were fixed with osteosynthesis screws. A postoperative computer tomography (CT) was performed and an iterative closest point algorithm was used to match the jaw of the CT preoperative with the jaw of the postoperative CT. Quantitative data of each group were described. The t-test was used to determine the influence of the utilization of the different types of SLA on accuracy values. Results: t-Test demonstrated a better accuracy of the multiple-type guides in almost all deviation values when the mucosa-supported guides were considered. Regarding the bone-supported template, the single-type fixed group showed a better accuracy while the highest values of deviation were registered by the multiple-type guides. The single-type group showed a better accuracy when the <b>tooth</b> <b>support</b> was considered. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicated best accuracy of the single-type guide using a bone or <b>tooth</b> <b>support.</b> The multiple-type guide recorded the best accuracy data when the mucosa support was considered comparing either a fixed and a not-fixed single-type guide...|$|E

40|$|The {{periodontal}} {{diseases are}} highly prevalent and can affect up to 90 % {{of the worldwide}} population. Gingivitis, the mildest form of periodontal disease, {{is caused by the}} bacterial biofilm (dental plaque) that accumulates on teeth adjacent to the gingiva (gums). However, gingivitis does not affect the underlying supporting structures of the teeth and is reversible. Periodontitis results in loss of connective tissue and bone support and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. In addition to pathogenic microorganisms in the biofilm, genetic and environmental factors, especially tobacco use, contribute to the cause of these diseases. Genetic, dermatological, haematological, granulomatous, immunosuppressive, and neoplastic disorders can also have periodontal manifestations. Common forms of periodontal disease have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and diabetes, but the causal relations have not been established.

40|$|Abstract In the "Glossary of Periodontics Terms" {{written by}} the American Academy of Periodontology, the occlusal trauma is defined as "an injury to the {{attachment}} apparatus {{as a result of}} excessive occlusal forces". Nowadays, the effects of occlusal trauma on <b>tooth</b> <b>support</b> tissues, the onset and the progression of periodontal disease are still debated: many commonplaces have been disproved, but some doubts and not yet clear points remain, even owing to the difficult diagnosis of the presence and the real clinical impact of a traumatic occlusion. Then, ethical reasons prevent researchers from prospective clinical trials. At the beginning of the last century occlusal trauma has been supposed to be an etiologic factor of "alveolar pyorrhea", but several studies attending more strict scientific criteria failed to prove such correlation. On the basis of the bacterial genesis of periodontal disease, researchers started evaluating the possible effects of occlusal discrepancies on incidence, progression and treatment outcomes of periodontitis, but all the results underlined the more relevant role played by micro-organisms. The present review of the literature runs through this controversy again, analysing the most significant studies published...|$|E

In this contribution we provide the first morphological description and morphometric analysis of the dental remains. All the human remains, except for Fumane 6, are deciduous teeth. Based on metric data (crown and cervical outline analysis, and lateral enamel thickness), and non-metric dental traits (e. g., mid-trigonid crest), Fumane 1 (lower left second deciduous molar) clearly belongs to Neandertal. For Fumane 4 (upper right central deciduous incisor) the taxonomic attribution is difficult due to heavy incisal wear. Some morphological features observed in Fumane 5 (lower right lateral deciduous incisor), coupled with the large size of the <b>tooth,</b> <b>support</b> Neandertal affinity.

40|$|Background/PurposeAlthough exhaustively studied, the {{mechanism}} responsible for <b>tooth</b> <b>support</b> and the mechanical {{properties of the}} periodontal ligament (PDL) remain a subject of considerable controversy. In the past, various experimental techniques and theoretical analyses have been employed to tackle this intricate problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the viscoelastic behaviors of the PDL using three-dimensional finite element analysis. MethodsThree dentoalveolar complex models were established to simulate the tissue behaviors of the PDL: (1) deviatoric viscoelastic model; (2) volumetric viscoelastic model; and (3) tension-compression volumetric viscoelastic model. These modified models took into consideration the presence of tension and compression along the PDL during both loading and unloading. The inverse parameter identification process was developed to determine the mechanical properties of the PDL from the results of previously reported in vitro and in vivo experiments. ResultsThe results suggest that the tension-compression volumetric viscoelastic model is a good approximation of normal PDL behavior during the loading-unloading process, and the deviatoric viscoelastic model is a good representation of how a damaged PDL behaves under loading conditions. Moreover, fluid appears to be the main creep source in the PDL.

40|$|Destruction of <b>tooth</b> <b>support</b> due to {{the chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease periodontitis is {{a major cause of}} tooth loss. There are limitations with available treatment options to tissue engineer soft tissue periodontal defects. The exogenous application of growth factors (GFs) such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has shown promise to enhance oral and periodontal tissue regeneration. However, the topical administration of GFs has not led to clinically significant improvements in tissue regeneration because of problems in maintaining therapeutic protein levels at the defect site. The utilization of PDGF gene transfer may circumvent many of the limitations with protein delivery to soft tissue wounds. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the effect of PDGF-A and PDGF-B gene transfer to human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on ex vivo repair in three-dimensional collagen lattices. HGFs were transduced with adenovirus encoding PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes. Defect fill of bilayer collagen gels was measured by image analysis of cell repopulation into the gingival defects. The modulation of gene expression at the defect site and periphery was measured by RT-PCR during a 10 -day time course after gene delivery. The results demonstrated that PDGF-B gene transfer stimulated potent (> 4 -fold) increases in cell repopulation and defect fill above that of PDGF-A and corresponding controls. PDGF-A and PDGF-B gene expression was maintained for at least 10 days. PDGF gene transfer upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinosital 3 -kinase and integrin α 5 subunit at 5 days after adenovirus transduction.

However, long-term prognosis of abutments treated with regeneration {{has to be}} proven. PURPOSE: This study investigated the long-term stability of clinical outcomes obtained with regeneration in strategically important abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen deep intrabony defects around strategically important abutments in 16 patients were treated according {{to the principles of}} GTR. After completion of initial periodontal therapy and placement of long-term provisional fixed partial dentures, nonresorbable membranes were applied. Membranes were removed after 6 weeks. All patients remained in a supervised recall program. Final fixed partial dentures were placed 1 year after surgery. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 1 year and then 4 to 8 years after surgery. RESULTS: Clinical attachment level gains of 5. 3 +/- 1. 8 mm, reductions in pocket depth (6. 1 +/- 2 mm), and increases in the percentage of radiographic bone support (31 % +/- 18 %) were observed at 1 year. At long-term follow-up visits, clinical attachment levels remained stable with respect to 1 year (- 0. 1 +/- 0. 6 mm; P =. 4).

In the present study, <b>tooth</b> <b>supporting</b> tissues of the recipient was histopathologically examined. Twenty-three cases out of 30 cases (about 80 %) were successful, while remaining seven cases (about 20 %) were unsuccessful. The latter included one case of cadavaric tooth graft. Compared to cases of allograft transplantation, the influence of xenograft -antigen stimulation seemed to be weak unexpectrdly, although the intial cell response was notable. Though various types of graft resoptions were observed, the most dominant was the resorption with ankylosis. The condition of attachment of the tooth grafts to <b>tooth</b> <b>supporting</b> tissues of the recipients was different {{in different parts of}} the graft, i. e. the gingival third, the middle third and the apical third. In the gingival third, the condition of attachment proved to be excellent. However, in the middle third and the apical third, the attachment was partial. The following 3 types of tissue changes were observed in the periodonal tissues of the recipients. The first type was the resorption of the graft ankylosis, which was the most dominant type, and which spread throughout the entire regino of the dental root similar to the hinge-like attachment of the fish tooth. In the second type of tissue chauge, no graft resorption was observed and the alveolar bone became dense after remodeling itself. In this case, the periodontal tissues were destroyed, and the grafts seemed to stay in the sockets due only to the persence of rough granulation.

It {{is assumed that}} multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) reside in the periodontal ligament (PDL) and {{play a crucial role}} in regulating physiological periodontal tissue regeneration. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize equine periodontal MSC. Tissue samples were obtained from four healthy horses. Primary cell populations were har-vested and cultured from the gingiva, from three horizontal levels of the PDL (apical, midtooth and subgingival) and for comparison purposes from the subcutis (masseteric region). Colony-forming cells were grown on uncoated culture dishes and typical in vitro characteristics of non-human MSC, i. e. self-renewal capacity, population doubling time, expression of stemness markers and trilineage differentiation were analyzed. Results Colony-forming cell populations from all locations showed expression of the stemness markers CD 90 and CD 105. In vitro self-renewal capacity was demonstrated by colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays. CFU-efficiency was highest in cell populations from the apical and from the mid-tooth PDL. Population doubling time was highest in subcutaneous cells. All investigated cell populations possessed trilineage differentiation potential into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. Conclusions Due to the demonstrated in vitro characteristics cells were referred to as equine subcutaneous MSC (eSc-MSC), equine gingival MSC (eG-MSC) and equine periodontal MSC (eP-MSC). According to different PDL levels, eP-MSC were further specified as eP-MSC from the apical PDL (eP-MSCap), eP-MSC from the mid-tooth PDL (eP-MSCm) and eP-MSC from the subgingival PDL (eP-MSCsg). Considering current concepts of cell-based regenerative therapies in horses, eP-MSC might be promising candidates for future clinical applications in equine orthopedic and periodontal diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{method is}} presented for {{the determination of}} the area of the periodontal ligament attached to teeth. This method requires the use of digitizing equipment for an accurate determination of tooth cross sections and a digital computer for final manipulation of the area calculations. The procedure is general and is not restricted to single-rooted teeth. The determination of both the stress in the periodontal ligament and the percentage loss of <b>tooth</b> <b>support</b> after bone loss has led sev-eral investigators to calculate the root sur-face areas of human teeth. Brown ' proposed a method for the deter-mination of the root surface area by coating the root surface with a latex solution that was removed and laid on graph paper after setting. The area of the root surface then was calculated by counting the number of millimeter squares covered. Jepsen 2 modified this procedure by use of a planimeter to measure the area of the latex coating when laid out flat; the areas measured then were correlated with standard radiographic data. Although these techniques propose a high degree of accuracy for anterior teeth, the information gained is insufficient to allow a stress analysis to be carried out. For this purpose, the root surface area as well as the exact geometry of the tooth root must be determined. Haack and Haft 3 analyzed the stresses in a model of the periodontal ligament of a maxillary central incisor; however, the tooth root shape was assumed to be paraboloidal to simplify calculations.
