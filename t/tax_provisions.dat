5|$|After the {{elections}} {{in the fall of}} 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making <b>tax</b> <b>provisions.</b> This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E

The <b>taxing</b> <b>provisions</b> were in a separate title (Title VIII) (for reasons related to the constitutionality of the 1935 Act). As part of the 1939 Amendments, the Title VIII <b>taxing</b> <b>provisions</b> were taken out of the Social Security Act and placed in the Internal Revenue Code and renamed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). Social Security payroll taxes are thus often referred to as [...] "FICA taxes." ...|$|R
25|$|Complexity is a {{separate}} issue from flatness of rate structures. Also, in the United States, income tax laws are often used by legislatures as policy instruments for encouraging numerous undertakings deemed socially useful — including the buying of life insurance, the funding of employee health care and pensions, the raising of children, home ownership, development of alternative energy sources and increased investment in conventional energy. Special <b>tax</b> <b>provisions</b> granted for any purpose increase complexity, irrespective of the system's flatness or lack thereof.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether different instructional methodologies {{have an impact}} on learning a complex accounting task: <b>tax</b> <b>provision</b> work. To become proficient in making <b>tax</b> <b>provision</b> judgments, an accountant must understand the rules and principles of GAAP and the rules and regulations governing income tax reporting. However, these two sets of rules are often in direct opposition. Using cognitive load theory and constructivist learning theory as a framework, this study predicted how schema acquisition, a key component of learning, could improve <b>tax</b> <b>provision</b> performance. Greater schema acquisition should in turn lead to more accurate performance. Hypotheses include the following: (a) participants who learn using a systems instructional method will perform better than participants who learn using traditional instructional method, (b) participants who practice actively should perform better than participants who practice passively, and (c) the relationship between instructional method and performance will be moderated by the practice method. These hypotheses were tested using a 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment, manipulating instructional method and practice method as independent variables. The results of this study are inconclusive. The statistically significant findings are invalid due to potentially unequal pre-tax knowledge among the subjects, and several hypotheses were not supported. The results of this study had the potential to benefit theory, practice, and education by identifying the most effective combination of instructional method and practice method to build a <b>tax</b> <b>provision</b> schema in a novice learner.

25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special <b>tax</b> <b>provisions</b> under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

Part III provides background for the analysis that follows by reviewing the marital deduction provisions, the Terminable Interest Rule, and the QTIP Provisions. Part IV demonstrates that the decision to grant the marital deduction for QTIP Property can be explained by means of a legal fiction that treats QTIP Property as passing in its entirety to the surviving spouse (2 ̆ 2 Ownership Fiction 2 ̆ 2). The Ownership Fiction ensures that the QTIP Property will ultimately be taxed in the surviving spouse 2 ̆ 7 s transfer tax base. This taxation is the topic of Parts V and VI, which address the QTIP <b>Taxing</b> <b>Provisions</b> and the QTIP Rulings, respectively.

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The <b>tax</b> <b>provisions</b> of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgage due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. Short-term interest rates remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|E
