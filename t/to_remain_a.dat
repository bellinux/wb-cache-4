5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, {{to ensure that this}} one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee. The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.|$|E

5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> great power in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E

She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective.

Merwin, who admired their work and was <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} {{lawyers and}} activists called for Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain. Ginsburg rejected these pleas. She affirmed her wish <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E
5|$|Following hospitalization, Shinji {{moves in}} with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> pilot.

5|$|In 2004, Alston {{returned}} to the Browns. While he was not valuable to the Browns at wide receiver, the team used him as a return specialist.

He played in nine regular season games in 2004 returning kickoffs. Alston {{returned to}} the Browns' training camp in 2005, where he competed with André Davis and Josh Cribbs <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> kick returner.

5|$|Initially, Hurricane Iris was {{forecast}} <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical cyclone}} while crossing Central America and to re-intensify {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean; had it done so, it would have retained the name Iris. Instead, the hurricane rapidly weakened after moving into the mountainous terrain of Guatemala, and within six hours of landfall the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm. Late on October9, within sixteen hours of landfall, the circulation dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico. As the remnants approached the Pacific Ocean, a new area of convection developed south of the original circulation of Iris. It gradually organized while continuing westward, developing into Tropical Storm Manuel; the new storm ultimately lasted until October18 before succumbing to cooler waters and wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks around in her apartment naked with the curtains open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows like Tiny Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus {{remained}} in Kent until 625, {{when he was}} consecrated as bishop by Justus, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on 21 July. He then accompanied Æthelburg, the sister of King Eadbald, to Northumbria where she was to marry King Edwin. A condition of the marriage was that Edwin had promised that he would allow Æthelburg <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> Christian and worship as she chose. Bede, writing in the early 8th century, reports that Paulinus wished to convert the Northumbrians, {{as well as provide}} religious services to the new queen.|$|E
