25|$|The largest {{component}} of OASDI is {{the payment of}} retirement benefits. These retirement benefits are a form of social insurance that is heavily biased toward lower paid workers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have to retire in relative poverty. With few exceptions, throughout a worker's career, the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) keeps track {{of his or her}} earnings and requires Federal Insurance Contribution Act, FICA or Self Employed Contribution Act, SECA, taxes to be paid on the earnings. The OASI accounts plus trust funds are the only Social Security funding source that brings in more than it sends out.|$|E

50|$|As Stated in its Mission and Vision Statements, The International Association of Women Police {{came to be}} {{in order}} {{to fight against the}} {{discrimination}} of women on police forces across the world. Fighting against cases of sexual harassment, limited job opportunities, and discriminatory treatment from male colleagues have all been key reasons for catalyzing the formation of an organization that promotes the equal treatment of women on the police force. The IAWP also works to ensure that women are satisfied with their careers on the force, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not feel powerless or unappreciated in their line of work. Overall, the IAWP was formed in order to promote equality among the sexes in the police force and to ensure the equal treatment, equal pay, and equal protection of women who chose a career in the criminal justice system.|$|E

50|$|In American Samoa, {{like many}} ancient cultures, {{everything}} is done together just {{like on the}} football field. The parents and grandparents are the most respected members of the family. The elders are responsible for making sure the children learn about the culture and traditions of the island. Even though the elders {{are the ones that}} teach the children about the family’s values, the kids are still expected to learn the culture through observing the parents at all times. Initially the children perform chores with an older sibling or someone close in age and try to emulate their every move. If they are doing the action wrong, the parents will tell them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not repeat the same mistake. While the children receive feedback when they do wrong, they are still expected to figure what they did wrong on their own instead of being told.|$|E
50|$|Residential {{combustion}} {{water heaters}} manufactured since 2003 in the United States have been redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per ANSI Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and {{gases in the}} vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions. These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, gasoline or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of flame arrestor screen, they require monitoring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the flame arrestor becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.|$|E

He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English. Cameron also said: [...] "If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place - tougher rules <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country." ...|$|E

5000|$|In historiography {{political}} {{antecedents of}} Daniel are summarized as [...] "scarcely homogeneous". Some of his paternal uncles engaged in Tafallese Cristinos militia and ancestors {{of his wife}} were distinguished Estella Liberals. It is clear, however, that the Carlist leaning prevailed; apart from Daniel’s father and other paternal uncles also his maternal uncle, Sebastián Urra Jordán, held various posts in the party and represented it in the Cortes. As it was him appointed by late Manuel cabezalero of his children, Urra has contributed to their Carlist outlook. Already {{as a child in}} Carlist-held Estella Daniel used to collect unexploded cartridges fired by the governmental troops <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not hurt the Carlists, and he admitted to having [...] "sucked" [...] Carlism when a child. Education in Orduña college, managed by the Jesuits, is likely to have reinforced this stand; also during academic years in Valladolid Irujo remained in the company of Carlism-minded friends.|$|E
5000|$|On May 28, 2010, the NHTSA {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the stacking of all-weather floor mats from any manufacturer {{on top of the}} factory floor mat could cause accelerator entrapment. In their press release they stated the following: [...] "NHTSA is urging drivers of 2010 Fusions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not stack the rubber “All Weather” floor mat on top of the secured carpeted floor mat. Further, drivers are reminded to ensure that any driver-side floor mats (whether they are the carpeted floor mat or all weather floor mat) are properly installed and restrained by the retention hooks on the floorboard. Depending on vehicle and floor mat design, it is possible for unsecured floor mats to interfere with accelerator or brake pedals {{in a wide range of}} vehicles. Therefore, NHTSA reminds all drivers of all makes and models to check the driver-side floor mats for secure installation and to follow all manufacturer instructions for installing the mats." ...|$|E

Eddy refuses at first, but when Rolf tells him that he will give the badge to Kevin, Eddy accepts the challenge. However, Rolf tells Kevin in private <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not succeed. The competition heats up when Kevin prepares tricks, traps, and tribulations, but the Eds manage to complete Rolf's tasks thanks to the Eds' ability to stand on each other to create [...] "The Tower of Eddy". After a head-butting competition with Rolf's goat, Victor, the Eds race Kevin to win the badge. The Eds win the race, but {{in order for the}} badge to be shared fairly, Rolf rips the badge into three pieces. Ed wants to trade his piece with Eddy's, but Eddy is so annoyed that he shoves it up Ed's nose and storms off.|$|E
