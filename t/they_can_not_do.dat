6000|$|... “Perhaps I shall here be asked, How, if {{the case}} be so—if the high [...] rate of {{industrial}} remuneration in America be only evidence of a [...] low cost of production—the fact is to be explained, since fact it [...] undoubtedly is, {{that the people of}} the United States are unable to [...] compete in neutral markets, in the sale of certain important [...] wares, with England and other European countries?(367) No one will [...] say that the people of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania, [...] are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen [...] of any country in the world. How happens it, then, that, enjoying [...] industrial advantages superior to other countries, they are yet [...] unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of [...] commerce? I shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly, and, in [...] the first place, let me state what my contention is with regard to [...] the cost of production in America. I do not contend that it is low [...] in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the [...] country, but only in that of a large, very important, but still [...] limited group. With regard to commodities lying outside this [...] group, I hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to [...] the cost of their production, one way or the other. But, secondly, [...] I beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged [...] ‘inability’ of New England and Pennsylvania to compete, let us [...] say, with Manchester and Sheffield, in the manufacture of calico [...] and cutlery. What it means, and what it only can mean, is that [...] they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of [...] remuneration on their industry which is current in the United [...] States. If only American laborers and capitalists would be [...] content with the wages and profits current in Great Britain, there [...] is nothing that I know of to prevent them from holding their own [...] in any markets to which Manchester and Sheffield can send their [...] wares. And this brings us {{to the heart of the}} question. Over a [...] large portion of the great field of industry the people of the [...] United States enjoy, as compared with those of Europe, (1) [...] advantages of a very exceptional kind; over the rest (2) the [...] advantage is less decided, or (3) they stand on a par with [...] Europeans, or (4) possibly they are, in some instances, at a [...] disadvantage. Engaging in the branches of industry in which their [...] advantage over Europe is great, they reap industrial returns [...] proportionally great; and, so long as they confine themselves to [...] these occupations, they can compete in neutral markets against all [...] the world, and still secure the high rewards accruing from their [...] exceptionally rich resources. But the people of the Union decline [...] to confine themselves within these liberal bounds. They would [...] cover the whole domain of industrial activity, and think it hard [...] that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part [...] of the field. They must descend into the arena with Sheffield and [...] Manchester, and yet secure the rewards of Chicago and St. Louis. [...] They must employ European conditions of production, and obtain [...] American results. What is this but to quarrel with the laws of [...] nature? These laws have assigned to an extensive range of [...] industries carried on in the United States a high scale of return, [...] far in excess of what Europe can command, to a few others a return [...] on a scale not exceeding the European proportion. American [...] enterprise would engage in all departments alike, and obtain upon [...] all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some. Here [...] we find the real meaning of the ‘inability’ of Americans to [...] compete with the ‘pauper labor’ of Europe. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so, and [...] at the same time secure the American rate of return on their work. [...] The inability no doubt exists, but it is one created, not by the [...] drawbacks, but by the exceptional advantages of their position. It [...] is as if a skilled artisan should complain that he could not [...] compete with the hedger and ditcher. Let him only be content with [...] the hedger and ditcher’s rate of pay, and there will be nothing to [...] prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival.”(368) ...|$|E
6000|$|Instead of the {{function}} of governing, {{for which it is}} radically unfit, the proper office of a representative assembly is to watch and control the government; to throw the light of publicity on its acts; to compel a full exposition and justification of all of them which any one considers questionable; to cinsure them if found condemnable, and, if the men who compose the government abuse their trust, or fulfill it in a manner which conflicts with the deliberate sense of the nation, to expel them from office, and either expressly or virtually appoint their successors. This is surely ample power, and security enough for the liberty of the nation. In addition to this, the Parliament has an office not inferior even to this in importance; to be at once the nation's Committee of Grievances and its Congress of Opinions; an arena in which not only the general opinion of the nation, but that of every section of it, and, as far as possible, of every eminent individual whom it contains, can produce itself in full light and challenge discussion; where every person in the country may count upon finding somebody who speaks his mind as well or better than he could speak it himself--not to friends and partisans exclusively, but in the face of opponents, to be tested by adverse controversy; where those whose opinion is overruled, feel satisfied that it is heard, and set aside not by a mere act of will, but for what are thought superior reasons, and commend themselves as such to the representatives {{of the majority of the}} nation; where every party or opinion in the country can muster its strength, and be cured of any illusion concerning the number or power of its adherents; where the opinion which prevails in the nation makes itself manifest as prevailing, and marshals its hosts in the presence of the government, which is thus enabled and compelled to give way to it on the mere manifestation, without the actual employment of its strength; where statesmen can assure themselves, far more certainly than by any other signs, what elements of opinion and power are growing and what declining, and are enabled to shape their measures with some regard not solely to present exigencies, but to tendencies in progress. Representative assemblies are often taunted by their enemies with being places of mere talk and bavardage. There has seldom been more misplaced derision. I know not how a representative assembly can more usefully employ itself than in talk, when the subject of talk is the great public interests of the country, and every sentence of it represents the opinion either of some important body of persons in the nation, or of an individual in whom some such body have reposed their confidence. A place where every interest and shade of opinion in the country can have its cause even passionately pleaded, in the face of the government and of all other interests and opinions, can compel them to listen, and either comply, or state clearly why they do not, is in itself, if it answered no other purpose, one of the most important political institutions that can exist any where, and one of the foremost benefits of free government. Such [...] "talking" [...] would never be looked upon with disparagement if it were not allowed to stop [...] "doing"; which it never would, if assemblies knew and acknowledged that talking and discussion are their proper business, while doing, as the result of discussion, is the task not of a miscellaneous body, but of individuals specially trained to it; that the fit office of an assembly is to see that those individuals are honestly and intelligently chosen, and to interfere no further with them, except by unlimited latitude of suggestion and criticism, and by applying or withholding the final seal of national assent. It is for want of this judicious reserve that popular assemblies attempt to do what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> well--to govern and legislate--and provide no machinery but their own for much of it, when of course every hour spent in talk is an hour withdrawn from actual business. But the very fact which most unfits such bodies for a council of legislation, qualifies them the more for their other office--namely, that they are not a selection of the greatest political minds in the country, from whose opinions little could with certainty be inferred concerning those of the nation, but are, when properly constituted, a fair sample of every grade of intellect among the people which is at all entitled to a voice in public affairs. Their part is to indicate wants, to be an organ for popular demands, and a place of adverse discussion for all opinions relating to public matters, both great and small; and, along with this, to check by criticism, and eventually by withdrawing their support, those high public officers who really conduct the public business, or who appoint those by whom it is conducted. Nothing but the restriction of {{the function}} of representative bodies within these rational limits will enable the benefits of popular control to be enjoyed in conjunction with the no less important requisites (growing ever more important as human affairs increase in scale and in complexity) of skilled legislation and administration. There are no means of combining these benefits except by separating the functions which guaranty the one from those which essentially require the other; by disjoining the office of control and criticism from the actual conduct of affairs, and devolving the former on the representatives of the Many, while securing for the latter, under strict responsibility to the nation, the acquired knowledge and practiced intelligence of a specially trained and experienced Few.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} {{an understanding of}} the potential of school mathematics as a marginalising practice, this paper draws on several issues which would seem to be important when considering why young people are opting out of school mathematics and ultimately school. Drawing on Australian and international literature this paper proposes that issues of pacing, the speed of content delivery and the linear discipline of mathematics have potential to marginalise young people. These issues coupled with classroom ethos give further weight to the contention of this paper that school mathematics acts as a social filter thereby reproducing (in most cases) the status quo. Classroom ethos has considerable potential for supporting or denying students access to learning.

40|$|Three {{chapters}} describe experiments {{which are}} dedicated to shed more light on {{the involvement of the}} mushroom bodies (MB) in olfactory learning of the honeybee (Apis mellifera). In order to do this the proboscis extension reflex paradigm was used within a classical conditioning. Chapter I shows the ability of bees to learn faster, if a certain kind of conditioning problem occurs several times. Bees do not seem to learn an abstract rule but underlie changes in their conditions or within their nervous system, which could be described by the term attention. Available data can not explain what exactly happens within the animal leading to an increased speed in reversal learning. Chapter II shows that honeybees can fulfill simple learning processes by using only one antenna, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> in a complex learning paradigm including the same stimuli. Since the main amount of connections between hemispheres is found between the MBs, it is concluded that both MBs including their connections work as a functional unit within the olfactory learning of the honeybee. This unit adds possibilities for processing olfactory signals to the abilities of a single MB. Lesion experiments described in chapter III are evidence for the same conclusion. In these experiments the transfer between hemispheres appears to be a critical factor with respect to olfactory learning. Different olfactory stimuli given to both antennae, in this case two distinct differential conditionings, lead to both brain sides impeding each other. Thus, bees only learn on one side. Ablated bees treated by Hydroxyurea are not able to learn on any side in this experimental design, although animals show only single side ablations. If olfactory information between sides has to be separated to fulfill the task, ablated bees solve the task on their intact brain side but not on their ablated hemisphere. Single side ablations do not seem to have any influence on bilateral olfactory learning...|$|E

In the practical part the qualitative research method, retrospective analysis, carried out using semi-standardized interview techniques. Participants were seniors aged 65 to 85 years, selected purposeful selection in town Milevska, township and village Sepekov Chyšky in South Bohemia. The aim was to explore the views of older people living in their families and look back at a career, find out their attitude to today's society, to today's values and beliefs compared with the period in which he grew up. The results show that the views of older people are much nerůzní, although each respondent was another age, sex, residence, occupation and different hobbies. It seems, therefore, that this really did not have any influence respondents' answers.

Katalikų bažnyčia išleido katechetinius dokumentus, kuriuose pabrėžiamas dėmesys suaugusiųjų švietimui, padedančiam suaugusiesiems pažinti save, analizuoti visuomenėje vykstančius reiškinius ir prisideda prie pilietiš- kumo ugdymo. Straipsnyje analizuojami neformaliojo katalikiškojo suaugusiųjų švietimo ypatumai. In our {{contemporary}} society {{a lot of}} traditional values like family, freedom lose their importance. People are often intolerant each other because of their religious or nationality. With the weakening of social relations people feel unsafe for their future, they trying to find meaning of live, but alone often <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> this. These problems can help to solve informal adult catholic education, which are very important because helps people to know themselves, analyzes various phenomena in society and contributes to citizenship promoting. There is much information about children catholic education, however, adult education is little researched in the literature. The aim of research is identify the importance of informal adult catholic education. Objectives of research: To reveal the importance of informal adult education. To explain catholic education value for human and society. To dispute informal catholic adult education programs. To define and empirically verified informal catholic adult education features, motives and interferences. Methods of research: the analysis of scientific literature and other sources, empirical research – questionnaire survey. After the analysis of literature and different sources it is based that informal education can solve different problems. Informal education {{can be divided into}} informal vocational education, which helps to adapt to a constantly changing labour market and non-vocational training, which helps to develop socio-cultural competences. It was explained that the informal catholic adult education is valuable, because it promotes citizenship, community, tolerance and ability to live in a diverse society.

40|$|The {{economy of}} European {{countries}} is afflicted {{with a severe}} recession and a high unemployment. The top managements of companies in Europe have interests in Japanese economy and management which produce a huge balance of payment surplus of 130 billion dollars and a low unemployment rate of 2. 5 %. Although they are much interested in Japanese economy, Japanese counterparts {{are not interested in}} European economy. The Figaro's financial colums, {{which is one of the}} most influential paper in France, report articles about Japanese economy or management at least once every two days, however, Japanese papers don't say anything about French economy this four months according Japanese paper digests. I have lectured "Japanese Management Features" in a class of Science Po. MBA course from the middle of May in 1993, to the beginning of July, in Paris. After finishing the lecture, I interviewed top managements of European companies which are consisted of 1 British, 1 German and 4 French.; The fundamental and basic objective of the business is to satisfy shareholders, clients and employees. But a starting point is shareholder. Japanese market has been entirely opened except cultural barriers.; A communication technology revolution will be concentrated to building up a powerful PC-based network instead of on-line system with large computer. But Germany and Japan are far behind U. S. in developing software for the network building. It's necessary to learn Japanese language in a long term to enter Japanese market. There is no barrier in it except mental one.; The problem of PECHINEY's business is due to macro economic problems like Russian undisciplined exportation of aluminum, confusion of European currency and minus growth of consumption. Japanese has not interest in European current economic crisis. European external trade deficit is higher than American one. So Japanese should have more interest in a success of GATT than a bilateral negotiation between Japan and U. S.; The number of wealthy men who bought luxurious goods has decreased and the income of middle class has increased. Many cosmetic companies produced mass-consumption items, of which design is the same as the luxurious ones design, to make middle class persons to buy much more. But no difference between luxurious items and mass consumption ones gave rise to a serious decrease of sales volume. We envy Japanese people's will to work even if they can't buy his own home by their income.; We diversify our business from the journals related with transportation and social affairs to ones related with pension, taxation and company law, and further change them from magazine to CD-Rom. We are also building up a data bank that aims personal use of the bar or owners of small companies.; The most important ability of top management is an ability to think from other people's viewpoint. Self-made people who have not this ability may succeed in American society, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so in France. As the number of Grand Ecole educated people is very small, our head-hunting job becomes very profitable. The author has to thank Mr. Jacques P. de Portu, adviser of MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, for kind interview arrangements...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} Indian languages, Tamil <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have {{aspirated}} consonants. The Tamil script <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have distinct letters for voiced and unvoiced stop, although both {{are present in}} the spoken language as allophones—i.e., they are in complementary distribution and the places <b>they</b> <b>can</b> occur <b>do</b> <b>not</b> intersect. For example, the voiceless stop [...] occurs {{at the beginning of the}} words and the voiced stop [...] cannot. In the middle of words, voiceless stops commonly occur as a geminated pair like -pp-, while voiced stops usually <b>do</b> <b>not.</b> Only the voiced stops occur after a vowel, or after a corresponding nasal. Thus both the voiced and voiceless stops can be represented by the same script in Tamil without ambiguity, the script denoting only the place and broad manner of articulation (stop, nasal, etc.). The Tolkāppiyam cites detailed rules as to when a letter is to be pronounced with voice and when it is to be pronounced unvoiced. The rule is identical for all stops.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare measurement of hearing handicap using self-reported and staff version of NHHI and hearing thresholds in nursing home residents. Materials and Method: The study participants were 43 individuals, 23 males and 20 females, aged 45 - 95 years. Pure tone average were calculated after conventional Pure tone audiometry. the self- and staff- reported questionnaire were also fulfilled. Results: Nine (20. 9 %) individuals have normal hearing, 6 (14 %) have slight, 10 (23. 3 %) mild, 7 (16. 3 %) moderate, 6 (16. 3 %) moderate to severe, 4 (9. 3 %) severe, and 1 (2. 3 %) profound hearing loss. Mean score of self and of staff reported versions were 32. 22 % + 29. 31 and 32. 67 % + 30. 98, respectively. According to Kruskal-wallis test, there were significant correlation between self-reported and hearing level and between staff-reported and hearing level. The Pierson coefficient variation test between self and staff-reported, and self-reported and hearing level, staff-reported and hearing level showed significant correlation.

40|$|Background and aim: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common synovial joint diseases (i. e. weight bearing joints) of the human body. This problem probably is more common in Iranian society that is used to sit on the floor and carpet. Following knee OA, patients complain of pain, inflammation, decrease of range of motion and muscle weakness. Therefore, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> independently <b>do</b> their activity of daily living (ADL). Consequently, the side effects of physical incapability may render to psychological problems and this in respect do affect on their quality of life. Various treatments such as pharmalogical, surgical and physiotherapy have been recommended at different stages of OA by specialist. In the present study, the effect of physical therapy agents (considering the point that physiotherapy has no or negligible side effects) have been studied on OA. Materials and methods: 40 patients participated in this study; the patients were refereed by orthopedic surgeon to the physiotherapy clinic of the Faculty of Rehabilitation. University ethical committee approved the procedures. Patients were randomly divided in two groups and physiotherapy treatments were applied as following: Group I Low Level Laser Therapy, heat, exercise. Group II. & Placebo (i. e. inactive Laser), heat, exercise. Results: The result of current study shows that both methods of physical therapy were quiet efficient on 7 variables that measured in this study (p< 0. 05). & However, the result of this study showed that in laser group, pain and speed of gait were more effectively influenced (p< 0. 000 and p< 0. 048 respectively) in comparison with routine physiotherapy. Consequently, patients can fairly independently do their activity of daily living and this in respect may reduce the psychological side effects of illness...|$|R
