25|$|In 1274 a {{long and}} {{expensive}} suit was begun between the prior and convent of Dunstable and Eudo la Zouche, who had become lord of Houghton and Eaton Bray by his marriage with Millicent de Cantelow. Eudo refused to recognise {{the rights of the}} prior (established not only by charter, but by long custom) to a gallows and prison in Houghton; he released one of his men from the prison and overthrew the gallows. Under the next prior, William le Breton, the gallows was restored; but Eudo still refused to recognise the prison as the prior's right, and presently erected a gallows of his own. The dispute went on for some years, and, after the death of Eudo, was continued by his wife Millicent until the year 1289, when it was finally decided in favour of the prior. The poverty and difficulties of the house went on increasing, although great efforts were made, after the deposition of William le Breton and other officers of the monastery in 1279, <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>expenses</b> and get in ready money for the payment of debts. Corrodies and chantries were granted to several persons, manors and churches were let out to farm, and in the year 1294 the usual allowance for one canon was made to serve for two. It was just at this time that the king was asking for subsidies for his Welsh war. By an accumulation of misfortune, in the same winter the outer walls of the priory had collapsed in the wet weather, and their hayricks had been destroyed by fire; and the tithes due to the Hospitallers from North Marston church were in such long arrears that a new arrangement had to be made to pay them off. In 1295 the house at Bradbourne was so poor that all the wool produced there had to be granted to the support of the three brethren who served the church and chapels. The later pages of the annals are a long story of poverty and struggle to get clear of debt; and the continuous narrative ends dismally enough with the account of the expenses of the installation of John of Cheddington, which amounted (with the addition of the debts of the previous prior) to £242 8s. 4d.|$|E

6000|$|In some {{languages}} {{the same}} word serves for [...] "stranger" [...] and [...] "enemy," [...] but in the Oxford dialect [...] "stranger" [...] and [...] "guest" [...] are synonymous.

[...] "They were friends of ours, moreover," [...] as Aristotle says, [...] "who brought these ideas in"; so the subject may be left with this brief notice.

This paper shows how cellular concept has contrasting approach in India and Japan and also, it gives detailed information about cell and cellular layout. Also, it consists of problem identification in the existing layout, objectives and methodology followed to achieve the objectives. In India, few companies like TVS, Maruti etc. have implemented it and other few are in a way of implementation (like Mahindra & Mahindra). A “Cell ” is a collection of dissimilar machines or processes, located closely together in a sequential operation manner and dedicated to a set of a similar part and product. Cell is that in which two or more machine should be arrange such that receiving and shipping should be present at same location. Each machine has fix position and dissimilar machines are arranged in a cell so, the layout is known as cellular layout.

40|$|Upsurge in {{bank failure}} cases under {{a more stable}} {{currency}} environment raised the need to deeply investigate sources of bank failures in Zimbabwe. This is considered an imperative move considering the impact that bank failures pose to stakeholders outside the banking sector such as investors and depositors, the Zimbabwean banking sector itself {{as well as the}} entire economy. This study investigated the determinants of bank failures in Zimbabwe under the multiple currency environment. The study employed pooled logit estimator using general to specific logit estimation procedure on fourteen banks by making use of the financial panel data for the period 2009 - 2012. Empirical findings indicated that the macroeconomic environment, in particular GDP growth rate, has much influence on bank failure than any of bank fundamentals. Among bank fundamentals, liquidity, profitability and capitalisation proved to be prominent bank related determinants of bank failures in their respective order. Findings also suggest that loan-to-deposits ratio (LTD), deposits-to-assets ratio (DTA), gross revenue ratio (GRR), return on assets(ROA), efficiency ratio(EFR), SIZE and GDP growth rate (GDP) variables are negatively correlated to the possibility of banks failing while loan-to-assets (LTA) have positive influence on bank failures. Based on these findings the researcher recommends that RBZ must accentuate liquidity and capital requirements since both liquidity and capital ratios were significant and had higher marginal effects. Undoubtedly, the researcher recommends banks <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> their operating <b>expenses</b> and also improve managerial efficiency so as promote and maintain bank safety and soundness and this will result in remarkable improvements in both profitability and efficienc...|$|R

5000|$|Aside {{from its}} unorthodox {{neighborhood}} chain-restaurant tie-in, Hooters Air sought to differentiate itself from other carriers with a distinctive style of in-flight service. The carrier was marketed towards golfers {{in an effort}} to bring casual and tournament players to Myrtle Beach's 100+ championship golf courses. Two [...] "Hooters Girls," [...] dressed in their restaurant uniforms, were on each flight assisting the (traditionally attired) in-flight crews with hospitality duties. The company advertised nonstop flights for most routes. Although Hooters Air billed itself as a low-fare carrier, rows of seats were removed from the aircraft to provide 34" [...] seating pitch to all passengers, comparable to the legroom offered by many carriers' business classes; in keeping with the golf-friendly orientation of the carrier, this was called [...] "Club Class" [...] seating. Additionally, all seats were upholstered in dark blue or black leather, and all aircraft were painted in Hooters' orange and white company colors featuring the company logo, and mascot ("Hootie the Owl"), on the vertical stabilizer. Also, {{at a time when many}} low-cost carriers were eliminating in-flight frills in an effort <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>expenses,</b> Hooters Air served complimentary meals to all customers on trips lasting over one hour.|$|E
5000|$|Financial {{problems}} caused Club members <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>expenses</b> in 1895. Neither the February production, Who's Who, nor the May offering, Snowball, {{were written by}} students, and both had relatively small casts. The following year the Club turned to a recent graduate, Post Wheeler '91, in hopes that his magic touch as co-author of The Honorable Julius Caesar could be repeated, and they were pleased with the result. The Mummy (1895-96) was also notable as the first production in Triangle's new home, the Casino, located on the lower campus near the present-day McCarter Theatre site. Yet another innovation was attempted in 1897. A Tiger Lily, the first Triangle show {{to be based on}} Princeton student life, was part of a double bill with Lend Me Five Shillings, a British farce. Since neither show was a great success, the Club returned to the tried and true in 1898 with a revival of Po-ca-hon-tas. The Privateer, presented in 1899, was originally entitled The Captain's Kidd Sister, but the name was changed because the University of Pennsylvania’s Mask and Wig Club had already produced a show about Captain Kidd. The [...] "Privateer March" [...] was the first commercially published Triangle song.|$|E

One measure for increasing the revenue--and the only one I think of--is the restoration of the duty on tea and coffee. These duties would add probably $18,000,000 to the present amount received from imports, and would in no way increase the prices paid for those articles by the consumers.|$|R

40|$|The liver is {{the organ}} {{primarily}} responsible for our metabolism and loss of its function　generally results in death. 　Luckily, the liver has a high regenerative ability. However, the mechanism of its regeneration has not yet been　clarified. This study therefore models liver　regeneration via a numerical simulation. In　addition, this simulation may　aid other experiments {{in the field of}} regenerative　medicine. As a first step, this study proposes an analytical model　based on the particle method. The analysis object is a hepatic lobule. The purpose of this analysis is to elucidate the　process, mechanism, and condition of cell growth on the micro-scale. Experiments using rats were conducted to　obtain the parameters for the model, namely the diffusivity, oxygen concentration, and oxygen consumption rate ofa cell. The most difficult to solve problem in liver cell proliferation technology is the　restricted volume in which　cells survive owing to oxygen supply problems. It is therefore necessary to extend the cell survival volume by　angiogenesis. Here, results were generated using a model of angiogenesis in which blood vessels formed from the　portal veins to a central vein, with repeated branching and connecting across the whole of the liver. In this way a　hepatic lobule was filled with liver cells. Additionally, the analysis results yielded the rates of the cross sectional　areas of the blood vessels. This research further aims to analyze the macro region by using analysis results obtained　on the micro-scale. Applying the thresholds which is the most closed to the experimental value obtained from　analysis results on the micro-scale to the macro region, it becomes available <b>to</b> <b>curtail</b> <b>expenses</b> and be kind to　animals in the liver experiments.
