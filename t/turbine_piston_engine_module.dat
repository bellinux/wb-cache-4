50|$|LPB was {{developed}} and patented by Lambda Technologies, a family-owned company from Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1996. Since then, LPB has been developed to produce compression in {{a wide array of}} materials to mitigate surface damage, including fretting, corrosion pitting, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and foreign object damage (FOD), and is being employed to aid in daily MRO operations. To this day, LPB is the only metal improvement method applied under continuous closed-loop process control and has been successfully applied to <b>turbine</b> <b>engines,</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines,</b> propellers, aging aircraft structures, landing gear, nuclear waste material containers, biomedical implants and welded joints.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of new emission limits for exhaust emissions of ship engines contributes {{to the development of}} new powertrain solutions. New solutions in the simplest approach concern the reduction of the concentration of sulfur in motor fuels. Typically, the aforementioned fuels have a lower value of viscosity which causes a number of supply system problems. It {{is becoming more and more}} common to use fuel cells in engine rooms of various types of marine vessels. Unlike conventional systems that use internal combustion engines, these systems have zero exhaust emissions. Hydrogen, methanol, methane and other substances may be used as a fuel in fuel cells. However, so far the best operating parameters are manifested by cells powered by hydrogen, which is associated with difficulties in obtaining and storing this fuel. Therefore, the use of turbine engines allows the obtaining of large operating and environmental advantages.

5000|$|After Chrysler {{finished}} the user program {{and other public}} displays of the cars, 46 of them were destroyed. 45 of the destroyed Turbines were burned and crushed at a scrap yard south of Detroit, while the other was destroyed at Chrysler's Chelsea Proving Grounds. A widely circulated explanation {{was that this was}} done to avoid a stiff tariff on the imported Ghia bodies, but Steve Lehto notes that this has been [...] "largely discredited". The destruction of the cars was also in line with the automobile industry's practice of not selling non-production or prototype cars to the public, and Lehto opines that it was also informed by public relations concerns harbored by Chrysler related to the potential difficulty of keeping the cars running and fears that owners would replace the <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> with <b>piston</b> <b>engines.</b> According to a Chrysler executive who was quoted in Look, [...] "Our main objective is research, and we did not want turbines turning up on used car lots."

50|$|Pulsejets {{have been}} used to power {{experimental}} helicopters, the engines being attached {{to the ends of the}} rotor blades. In providing power to helicopter rotors, pulsejets have the advantage over <b>turbine</b> or <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> of not producing torque upon the fuselage since they don't apply force to the shaft, but push the tips. A helicopter may then be built without a tail rotor and its associated transmission and drive shaft, simplifying the aircraft (cyclic and collective control of the main rotor is still necessary). This concept was being considered as early as 1947 when the American Helicopter Company started work on its XA-5 Top Sergeant helicopter prototype powered by pulsejet engines at the rotor tips. The XA-5 first flew in January 1949 and was followed by the XA-6 Buck Private with the same pulsejet design. Also in 1949 Hiller Helicopters built and tested the Hiller Powerblade, the world's first hot-cycle pressure-jet rotor. Hiller switched to tip mounted ramjets but American Helicopter went on to develop the XA-8 under a U.S. Army contract. It first flew in 1952 and was known as the XH-26 Jet Jeep. It used XPJ49 pulsejets mounted at the rotor tips. The XH-26 met all its main design objectives but the Army cancelled the project because of the unacceptable level of noise of the pulsejets and the fact that the drag of the pulsejets at the rotor tips made autorotation landings very problematic. Rotor-tip propulsion has been claimed to reduce the cost of production of rotary-wing craft to 1/10 of that for conventional powered rotary-wing aircraft. Pulsejets have also been used in both control-line and radio-controlled model aircraft. The speed record for control-line model aircraft is greater than 200 miles per hour (323 km/h).|$|R

50|$|A {{very common}} {{question}} is how to contrast the thrust rating of a jet engine with the power rating of a <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> Such comparison is difficult, as these quantities are not equivalent. A <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> does not move the aircraft by itself (the propeller does that), so <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller. Except for changes in temperature and air pressure, this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting.|$|R
50|$|Turbines have {{historically}} been more expensive to produce than <b>piston</b> <b>engines,</b> though this is partly because <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the turbocharger.|$|R

50|$|The motorjet was a {{very early}} design which used a <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> {{in place of the}} {{combustion}} chamber, similar to a turbocharged <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> except that the thrust is derived from the turbine instead of the crankshaft.

2500|$|Whittle {{continued}} {{working on}} the motorjet principle after his thesis work but eventually abandoned it when further calculations showed it would weigh {{as much as a}} conventional engine of the same thrust.

[...] Instead of using a <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> to provide the compressed air for the burner, a turbine could be used to extract some power from the exhaust and drive a similar compressor to those used for superchargers.
