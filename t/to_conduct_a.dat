5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>a</b> major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E

Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after exposure to the show, especially letter and number recognition.|$|E

Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First US Army. The disastrous Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E

This operation was quickly followed up with Operation Ripper, which retook Seoul in March.

5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam.

The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>a</b> successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
