60|$|By {{this time}} I {{expected}} to do no less, but I was so curious to see Tedham again that I should {{have been willing to}} do much worse, rather <b>than</b> forego <b>my</b> meeting with him.

25|$|In Travnik, he {{established}} a Divan, a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained {{a reputation as a}} hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. God I fear slightly, Gradaščević replied, the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own horse.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other <b>than</b> <b>my</b> scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller <b>than</b> <b>my</b> mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger <b>than</b> <b>my</b> brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{getting the}} Game 7 win at Kauffman Stadium {{where he started}} his career, Affeldt said, [...] "To {{be able to do}} it in Kansas City, with my past history, it just means a lot to me. It means my end was better <b>than</b> <b>my</b> beginning." ...|$|E

500|$|Colbert's fictional {{history is}} not always rigidly adhered to by the show's writers. The comedian himself says that, [...] "My character's history {{may not always be}} {{perfectly}} consistent ... There's my bio and there's my character's bio, and then there's my character's history, which is slightly different <b>than</b> <b>my</b> character's bio." [...] His early life, prior to becoming host of The Colbert Report, is expanded upon in I Am America (And So Can You!).|$|E
500|$|In 1964, the Mets {{moved into}} the new Shea Stadium; Stengel commented that [...] "the park is lovelier <b>than</b> <b>my</b> team". The Mets {{finished}} 53–109, again in last place. By this time, the fans were starting to be impatient with the losing, {{and a number of}} people, including sportscaster Howard Cosell and former Dodger Jackie Robinson, criticized Stengel as ineffective and prone to fall asleep on the bench. Stengel was given a contract for 1965, though Creamer suggested that Weiss, Grant and Payson would have preferred that the 74-year-old Stengel retire.|$|E
500|$|The sketch {{became an}} instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans. Captain Kirk actor William Shatner was asked which Star Trek parody was his favorite: Belushi's {{impression}} of himself, or the later satire wherein Shatner appeared on Saturday Night Live in a sketch telling Star Trek fans known as Trekkies to [...] "Get a life". Shatner said he preferred Belushi's impression {{to his own}} later appearance on the comedy television program. Shatner commented: [...] "I like Belushi's work as Kirk better <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own".|$|E

500|$|The novel {{examines}} the nature versus nurture debate in detail. At {{the beginning of}} the novel, Cal writes, [...] "Sing now, O Muse, of the recessive mutation on my fifthchromosome." [...] He then apologizes, saying, [...] "Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That's genetic, too." [...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, [...] "If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't come up with anything better <b>than</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E
500|$|During a 2007 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Chabon discussed his second book under the contract, saying, [...] "I {{would like it to}} be set in the present day and feel right now the urge to do something more mainstream <b>than</b> <b>my</b> recent work has been." [...] During a Q session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a [...] "naturalistic" [...] novel about two families in Berkeley. In a March 2010 {{interview with}} the Guardian newspaper, Chabon added that [...] "So far there's no overtly genre content: it's set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Their first child, a {{daughter}} named Chinelo, {{was born on}} 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and another boy named Chidi, on 24 May 1967. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried about the world view– {{especially with regard to}} race– expressed at the school, especially through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life. In 1966, Achebe published his first children's book, Chike and the River, to address some of these concerns. After the Biafran War, the Achebes had another daughter on 7 March 1970, named Nwando. When asked about his family Achebe stated: [...] "There are few things more important <b>than</b> <b>my</b> family." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 1866 George was {{appointed}} headmaster of Liverpool College, {{and the family}} moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener <b>than</b> <b>my</b> own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E
500|$|Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{mentioned that}} Madonna would play in Italy {{as part of}} a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995. However, Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita, directed by Alan Parker. Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a [...] "shorter tour" [...] because of filming, however, Madonna commented, [...] "I've waited years for this role, and I have to put every ounce of concentration into it. I love touring, and I very much want to go out with this album. But I can't—I'd be going straight from months on the road right into filming; I'd be exhausted and strained. It wouldn't be {{in the best interests of}} the movie for me to be at any less <b>than</b> <b>my</b> peak of energy".|$|E
500|$|Brideshead Revisited was {{published}} in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, [...] "my first novel rather <b>than</b> <b>my</b> last". It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was {{the fate of the}} large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of Stalin's Soviet Union by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as [...] "a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts". Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the 1945 general election, he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new [...] "Dark Age".|$|E
