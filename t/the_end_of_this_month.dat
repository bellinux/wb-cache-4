2500|$|On November 2, 2015, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub ruled Cosby and {{his former}} lawyer Martin Singer must give a {{deposition}} despite their efforts to have the case thrown out (Singer is not named as a defendant in the case). The ruling states Dickinson's lawyers can only seek answers {{as to whether the}} denials were made maliciously, and Cosby and Singer can assert attorney-client privilege and refuse to answer some questions. Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston. On November 12, a California appeals court temporarily halted an order requiring them to testify. Both parties are required to provide information by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> to state their cases as to why or why not the deposition should proceed. [...] "We are confident that once the Court of Appeals hears full argument on the issues it will allow the deposition of Mr. Cosby and his attorney to go forward," [...] Dickinson's attorney Lisa Bloom wrote in an email. An email sent to Cosby's Attorney seeking comment was not answered. Marty Singer announced that he was planning a new legal move of his own. [...] "I'm looking forward to pursuing claims against Janice Dickinson and Lisa Bloom after I prevail in this action," [...] Singer told Deadline tonight.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 March, however, Regenvanu was reshuffled to the Ministry of Justice and Social Affairs. Prime Minister Kilman {{had just}} sacked Justice Minister Yoan Simon, who had [...] "reportedly backed the oppositionâ€™s {{plans for a}} motion of no confidence" [...] in him, and needed to shore up his {{coalition}} government by bringing in a new party. Kilman offered a Cabinet position to the Republican Party, who demanded the Lands Ministry. Consequently, Alfred Carlot replaced Regenvanu as Minister for Lands, while Regenvanu {{was appointed to the}} vacant position of Minister for Justice. Ben Bohane, of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, remarked that Regenvanu seemed to have been [...] "sacrificed to allow the [...] to come in as a coalition partner for the government. The government's numbers are very shaky. Parliament is set to resume some time at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> and again there is ongoing talk of a vote of no confidence." [...] Radio New Zealand International, describing Regenvanu as a reformer during his three weeks as Minister for Lands, noted: [...] "Reliable sources from the office of the opposition say Mr Kilman {{had no choice but to}} make the reshuffle to stay in power." [...] Radio Australia noted that he had been [...] "transferred due to political pressure", as the government tried to maintain a viable parliamentary majority. It added that Regenvanu was [...] "not happy about leaving before finishing significant changes to the laws on land ownership". Carlot said he would continue Regenvanu's reforms aimed at rooting out and prevent corrupt practices.|$|E

This so much enraged the duke that he at first intended to sally out and call upon the populace of Paris to aid him to rescue the prisoners. The princes of the blood, however, restrained him from doing this; but although he pretended to be appeased he sent secret letters to the Duke of Burgundy begging him to come to his assistance.|$|E
