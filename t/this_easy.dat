5|$|Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba {{to march}} against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long {{remained}} an indomitable {{thorn in the}} Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, {{the existence of a}} free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, who might be encouraged to seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, {{and as soon as the}} Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first reached it.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} Japanese ancestry, the Japanese Government {{believed}} that Brazilians {{would be more}} easily integrated into Japanese society. In fact, <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> integration did not happen, since Japanese Brazilians and their children born in Japan are treated as foreigners by native Japanese. This apparent contradiction between being and seeming causes conflicts of adaptation for the migrants and their acceptance by the natives.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of catalase in a microbial or tissue sample {{can be demonstrated}} by adding hydrogen peroxide and observing the reaction. The production of oxygen {{can be seen by}} the formation of bubbles. <b>This</b> <b>easy</b> test, which can be seen with the naked eye, without the aid of instruments, is possible because catalase has a very high specific activity, which produces a detectable response, as well as the fact that one of the products is a gas.|$|E

25|$|Every player's {{character}} is assigned six clones, {{known as a}} six-pack, which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death. The game lacks a conventional health system; most wounds the player characters can suffer {{are assumed to be}} fatal. As a result, Paranoia allows characters to be routinely killed, yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game. <b>This</b> <b>easy</b> spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character's clone family. Additional clones can be purchased if one gains sufficient favour with the Computer.|$|E

By 11:00, the squadron was anchored in Choc Bay. The troops were landed by 17:00 and {{half an hour}} later the town of Castries was in British hands. In the island's main fortress, Morne-Fortunée, the French troops refused to surrender; the British stormed it at 04:00 on 22 June, and by 04:30 St Lucia was in British hands. Following <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> victory, the British sent a force to Tobago, which capitulated on 1 July.|$|E

500|$|On 19 October 1988, the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, {{issued a}} notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 to the Independent Broadcasting Authority prohibiting the {{broadcast}} of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish {{political and military}} organisations. The ban prevented the UK news media from broadcasting the voices, though not the words, of ten Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups, as well as Sinn Féin. Among the other groups affected were the Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army, Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, although the ban was targeted primarily at Sinn Féin. Addressing the House of Commons on the ban, Hurd said, [...] "the terrorists themselves draw support and sustenance from access to radio and television ... {{the time has come}} to deny <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism", while the Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, said it would [...] "deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity".|$|E

2500|$|When a {{macrophage}} in the spleen identifies a RBC with a Heinz body, it {{removes the}} precipitate {{and a small}} piece of the membrane, leading to characteristic [...] "bite cells". However, if a large number of Heinz bodies are produced, {{as in the case of}} G6PD deficiency, some Heinz bodies will nonetheless be visible when viewing RBCs that have been stained with crystal violet. <b>This</b> <b>easy</b> and inexpensive test can lead to an initial presumption of G6PD deficiency, which can be confirmed with the other tests.|$|E
50|$|Finally, other {{researchers}} have advocated grouping the 24 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence).

2500|$|The tobacco {{industry}} began advertising the now inexpensive cigarettes to Europe and United States citizens. [...] Many {{other forms of}} tobacco quickly dropped from production in the United States in favor of <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> to produce, easy to inhale tobacco product. Sales of cigarettes grew astronomically. In one example, American Tobacco Co., listed on the American Stock Exchange, with sales of $25,000,000 in 1890, increased its sales to $316,000,000 in 1903. After the Civil War debts were paid off, taxes were almost completely removed from cigarettes. It was at this point, that the cigarette became {{an integral part of}} American culture, which lasted until scientific discoveries revealed the health consequences of smoking.|$|E

Hercule Poirot, however, prevents <b>this</b> <b>easy</b> way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In And Then There Were None, the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions {{of some of these}} mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons– e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the Billy Wilder film from 1957.) In Death Comes as the End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim [...]|$|E
