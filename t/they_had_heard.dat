5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard.</b> Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Waller declare {{he would come}} home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E

5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it was}} on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|Ivan Asen II was a {{powerful}} support to Vladislav; when Asen died, there was internal unrest. Vladislav may have stopped the unrest if the Mongols had not been threatening all of Europe. Between 1206 and 1227, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan conquered territories that none before him {{had been able to}} conquer; his empire extended all over Asia and to Crimea. By 1240, all of Russia had been captured by the Mongols; Poland, Hungary, and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia were subsequently taken. In the winter of 1241, the Mongols crossed the Danube and entered western Hungary; Béla IV could not manage to organize any resistance. All of Croatia was burned, and Kadan and Batu Khan (the grandson of Genghis Khan) looked for Béla IV, who was in Split at the time; Béla soon moved to Trogir, as Split was not safe. The Mongols did not attack Split, but instead unsuccessfully attacked Klis, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that Béla IV was hiding. Béla then fled to the island of Rab. The Mongols attempted to conquer the island, but their forces were hurt in naval battles; they were also forced to hurry back home to choose the new Khan after the death of Ogatay. While returning home, they crossed and devastated Serbia, Bosnia and Bulgaria. Although the Serbian lowland was destroyed, the Mongol attack did not have a large impact, as the population had retreated into inaccessible forests that Mongols had no will to enter. The Serbian cities of Kotor, Drivast and Svač were destroyed. The Mongol invasion brought turmoil and shock, but not any major changes; the real shock came when Asen died, which left Vladislav without significant support.|$|E

30|$|Provided {{that working}} memory plays {{a crucial role}} in EFL {{language}} comprehension, it may also be important in EFL listening comprehension, according to Wu (1998), when task demands are high, due to storage and processing needs, the computation will slow down, and thus some partial results from working memory processing may be forgotten. This may account for the fact that EFL listeners often {{seem to be able to}} hear everything, but either forget what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> easily or cannot process what <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> into meaning relationships. Accordingly, EFL listening comprehension depends on the storage and processing of information by the mind. Therefore, working memory may influence EFL listening co m prehension.|$|R
