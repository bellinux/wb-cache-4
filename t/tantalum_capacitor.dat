2500|$|A {{tantalum}} electrolytic capacitor, {{a member}} of the family of electrolytic capacitors, [...] is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) is made of tantalum on which a very thin insulating oxide layer is formed, which acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A solid or liquid electrolyte which covers the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second, cathode electrode (−) of the capacitor. Because of its very thin and relatively high permittivity dielectric layer, the <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high capacitance per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.|$|E

50|$|Computers use {{large numbers}} of filter capacitors, making size an {{important}} factor. Solid tantalum and wet tantalum capacitors offer {{some of the best}} CV (capacitance/voltage) performance {{in some of the most}} volumetrically efficient packaging available. High currents and low voltages also make low equivalent series resistance (ESR) important. Solid tantalum capacitors offer low ESR versions that can often meet ESR requirements but they are not the lowest ESR option among all capacitors. Solid tantalums have an additional issue which must be addressed during the design stage. Solid tantalum capacitors must be voltage derated in all applications. A 50% voltage derating is recommended and generally accepted as the industry standard; e.g.: A 50V solid <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> should never be exposed to an actual application voltage above 25V. Solid tantalum capacitors are very reliable components if the proper care is taken and all design guidelines are carefully followed. Unfortunately, the failure mechanism for a solid <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> is a short which will result in a violent flaring up and smoking on a PCB capable of damaging other components in close proximity as well as completely destroying the capacitor. Fortunately, most solid <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> failures will be immediate and very evident. Once in application solid <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> performance will improve over time and the chances of a failure due to component mis-manufacturing decrease. Wet tantalums are a type of the electrolytic capacitor, using a tantalum pellet in an electrolytic material sealed in a hermetic package. This type of <b>tantalum</b> <b>capacitor</b> does not require the same derating that a solid tantalum does and its failure mechanism is open. A 10% to 20% voltage derating curve is recommended for wet tantalums when operating from 85C to 125C. Wet tantalums are not commonly referred to as just 'electrolytics' because usually 'electrolytic' refers to aluminium electrolytics.|$|E
