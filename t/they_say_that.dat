5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious medical problem. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E

5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|The log {{discusses}} {{a telephone}} call made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station. According to the prosecution, this is the telephone call {{known to have been}} made by Bamber, the same call that is entered in the event log. There was only one call that night to the police station about the shooting, the prosecution says, and it was made by Bamber at or just before 3:26am. Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E
5|$|What Arafat {{says about}} me doesn't bother me. Not only he, {{but also a}} whole list of Arab and world {{politicians}} claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA. Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E

25|$|Critics say {{large-scale}} CCS deployment is unproven {{and decades}} {{away from being}} commercialized. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is risky and expensive and that a better option is renewable energy.

25|$|Milošević's {{supporters}} {{contend that}} {{the representatives of the}} SFRY presidency were elected according to the law. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Milošević enjoyed genuine popular support so it was perfectly logical for his allies to be elected to the presidency.

25|$|The {{basis of}} fascism's support of violent action in {{politics}} is connected to social Darwinism.

25|$|Police {{forces have}} said, {{on a number}} of occasions, that {{enforcement}} of the Hunting Act 2004 like much wildlife crime is a low priority for them, although <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they will enforce the law.
