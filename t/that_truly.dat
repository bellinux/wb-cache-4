25|$|The ship <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> {{launched}} {{the first phase}} of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the caravel, a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing luffing. The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to tack. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Anunciação.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Machali lost {{almost all}} of her teeth, sight in one eye, and much of her {{strength}} due to aging. She also lost her territory, as her daughter Sundari from her last litter drove her out of her turf. As she was unable to hunt and kill for herself, park staff provided her with food. This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali living longer than she should have, and <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Nigeria's rank {{improved}} from 143rd to the 136th {{position on}} Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. In late 2013, Nigeria's then Central Bank governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi informed President Goodluck Jonathan {{that the state}} oil company, NNPC, had failed to remit US$20 billion in oil revenues owed to the state. Jonathan however dismissed the claim and replaced Sanusi for his mismanagement of the central bank's budget. A Senate committee also found Sanusi’s account to be lacking in substance. After {{the conclusion of the}} NNPC's account audit, it was announced in January 2015 that NNPC's non-remitted revenue is actually US$1.48 billion, which it needs to refund to the government. Upon release of both the PwC and Deloitte report by the government at the eve of its exit, it was however determined <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> close to $20 billion was indeed missing or misappropriated or spent without appropriation.|$|E

25|$|On {{graduating from}} the Academy of Music in Kraków in 1958, Penderecki took up a {{teaching}} post at the Academy. His early works show the influence of Anton Webern and Pierre Boulez (Penderecki has also been influenced by Igor Stravinsky). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the Warsaw Autumn with the premieres of the works Strophen, Psalms of David, and Emanations, but the piece <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> brought him to international attention was Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (see threnody and atomic bombing of Hiroshima), written in 1960 for 52 string instruments. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes great use of tone clusters. He originally titled the work 8' 37", but decided to dedicate it {{to the victims of}} Hiroshima.|$|E
25|$|Taiwanese {{literature}} {{mainly focused}} on the Taiwanese spirit and the essence of Taiwanese culture. People in literature and the arts {{began to think about}} issues of Taiwanese culture, and attempted to establish a culture <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> belonged to Taiwan. The significant cultural movement throughout the colonial period were led by the young generation who were highly educated in formal Japanese schools. Education played such a key role in supporting the government and to a larger extent, developing economic growth of Taiwan. However, despite the government prime effort in elementary education and normal education, there was a limited number of middle schools, approximately 3 across the whole country, so the preferred choices for graduates were leaving for Tokyo or other cities to get an education. The foreign education of the young students was carried out solely by individuals' self-motivation and support from family. Education abroad got its popularity, particularly from Taichung county, with the endeavor for acquiring skills and knowledge of civilization even under the situation of neither the colonial government nor society being able to guarantee their bright future; with no job plan for these educated people after their return.|$|E

500|$|Summing up Captain Scarlet as [...] "better puppets, bigger {{action and}} a huge step {{backwards}} in stories" [...] compared to Thunderbirds, Peel disputes {{the claim that the}} next generation of puppets mark a failure {{on the part of the}} series, arguing that the increased realism could not have deterred an audience familiar with the previous design. Although to his mind the characterisation was less endearing, Peel suggests that it is an over-emphasis on the visual, at the expense of characterisation, <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> accounts for the reduced credibility of Captain Scarlet.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} considered the missions {{an improvement over}} Grand Theft Auto III, although some noted occasional awkwardness and frustration. IGN's Perry wrote that the game's missions give the player [...] "a stronger feeling of being inside a story within a world <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> exists". Game Informers Matt Helgeson found the missions to be more complex, and AllGame's Scott Alan Marriott felt that the storyline was improved as a result. Marriott also found the lead character of Tommy to be more engaging than Grand Theft Auto IIIs Claude; IGN's Perry felt that Rockstar [...] "found the right person and the right choice", and Edge wrote that Tommy [...] "sweats charisma", commending Ray Liotta's performance.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, Trent Ward of IGN stated the best {{element of the}} role-playing system was allowing gamers to [...] "play the game as completely different characters", and felt this made each play-through unique. Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying [...] "There are very few games that allow you [...] play the way you want". Alec Norands of Allgame believed that the different character classes made the game “diverse enough to demand instant replayability". Robert Mayer from Computer Games Magazine called System Shock 2 [...] "a game <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> defies classification in a single genre", and ensured that [...] "the action is occasionally fast-paced, it's more often tactical, placing a premium on thought rather than on reflexes." ...|$|E

500|$|Video game {{journalists have}} praised GoldenEye 007 for proving {{that it is}} {{possible}} to create a [...] "fun" [...] first-person shooter experience on a console in both single-player and multiplayer modes; when the game was released, the first-person shooter was primarily a genre for PC gamers. Journalists noted that the game [...] "opened the genre to a completely new market" [...] and that it was [...] "the first big console [...] <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> got it right." [...] The game has subsequently become credited alongside Shiny Entertainment's MDK for pioneering and popularising the now-standard inclusion of scoped sniper rifles in video games. The game's use of context-sensitive hit locations on enemies added a realism that was previously unseen in video games, though the Quake computer mod Team Fortress already featured locational damage like headshots.|$|E

500|$|The album also {{garnered}} numerous {{mixed reviews}} that {{felt that it}} would only be enjoyed by fans of the franchise; Staples described the tracks as [...] "musical fan fiction ready for both celestial dance floors and distant forgotten landscapes", while Jon Dolan, reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine, rated it {{two and a half stars}} out of five, feeling that many of the producers involved with the project didn't experiment enough with the concept that it was [...] "hard to get beyond timid fanboy reverence." [...] The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes, who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to [...] "the nasty details, the blemishes, the facts of this world <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> corrupt our collective sense of well-being and hope" [...] in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed.|$|E

500|$|Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a {{relatively}} positive review. He wrote, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' was Duchovny's nudge-nudge, wink-wink writing-directing effort for this season. [...] Duchovny did not fail to deliver an episode <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> reflected his own wit and intelligence. All the while remaining true {{to the spirit of}} the show that made him famous." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that it [...] "is muddled and frequently so in love with just being weird for weird’s sake that everybody forgets we need at least a little justification to pull everything together in the end." [...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E
500|$|The game's pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} were credited {{for their}} rich details and dismal art style. According to IGN editor Doug Perry, [...] "Crashed cars, rubbish and rubble, totally destroyed city streets, and scattered broken glass and debris, all {{are housed in}} a suburban area <b>that</b> <b>truly</b> looks devastated in the worst possible way." [...] GameSpot felt that the 3D modeling of Jill Valentine was greatly improved {{when compared to the}} [...] "blocky" [...] models in the original game. The music and sound effects received similar praise, with GamePro remarking that the game [...] "keeps the action hot by hiding what you shouldn't see, but telling you about it through the audio." [...] The introduction of the Nemesis creature was highly praised. Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the first encounter as shocking, while CVG said that the creature increases the tension level [...] "to an insane degree" [...] because the player never knows when he will show up.|$|E

[...] "The Harrowing", particularly its final scene, was selected as Empire Online's 17th greatest television moment of 2014.
