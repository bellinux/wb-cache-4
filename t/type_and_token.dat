They obey his call; they do his will; they show forth his glory; they return to life, they breed, they are preserved, by the same spirit by which the body of Jesus rose from the dead; and, therefore, every flower which blossoms, and every bird which sings, at Easter-tide; everything which, like the seeds, was dead, and is alive again, which, like the birds, was lost, and is found, is a <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>token</b> of Christ, their Maker, who was dead and is alive again; who was lost in hell on Easter-eve, and was found again in heaven for evermore; and {{the resurrection of the}} earth from her winter's sleep commemorates to us, as each blessed Easter-tide comes round, the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, who made all the world, and redeemed all mankind, and sanctifieth to eternal life all the elect people of God: a witness to us that some day life shall conquer death, light conquer darkness, righteousness conquer sin, joy conquer grief; when the whole creation, which groaneth and travaileth in pain until now, shall have brought forth that of which it travails in labour; even the new heavens and the new earth, wherein shall be neither sighing nor sorrow, but God shall wipe away tears from all eyes.|$|E

MÉTODO: foram gravadas e transcritas as falas de 60 crianças com desenvolvimento típico de linguagem em atividades lúdicas com as mães ou professora. A seguir, efetuaram-se os cálculos da taxa de type/token (TTR) e de types e tokens (ty/to), na forma total e segmentar, com sua distribuição em classes gramaticais. Os resultados foram analisados estatisticamente, por meio dos testes t-student e análise de variância (ANOVA). RESULTADOS: o número de types e tokens totais apresentou vantagens sobre o segmentar em termos de descrição de classes gramaticais e na diferenciação estatística das faixas etárias de 18, 24 e 32 meses. Evolutivamente substantivos surgem primeiro do que verbos, advérbios e adjetivos e demais classes gramaticais que se completam até 32 meses. CONCLUSÃO: não houve diferença estatística quanto ao gênero. A análise isolada dos types e tokens é mais efetiva do que a divisão dos mesmos (TTR), tendo validade estatística na diferenciação das faixas etárias de 18, 24 e 32 meses. O número de types e tokens segmentar é menos efetivo na descrição gramatical considerando faixa etária e gênero. PURPOSE: to {{comparatively}} {{analyze the}} change in <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>tokens</b> <b>and</b> the rate of type / token in children of both genders, aged between 18 and 36 months, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, as for grammatical category and total measure and segmental aspect. METHOD: the speech of sixty children with typical language acquisition was recorded while playing with their mothers or teachers. The type/token ratio (TTR) and the total <b>and</b> segmental <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>tokens</b> were calculated, as for their grammatical distribution. The results were submitted to statistical analyses by Student Test and Variance Analysis (ANOVA). RESULTS: {{the total number of}} <b>types</b> <b>and</b> the <b>tokens</b> is more effective to describe children grammatical evolution, among 18 and 32 months age, than the segmental one. Substantives emerge first than verbs, adverbs, adjectives and others grammatical categories. All of the grammatical categories are in production at the 32 months of age. CONCLUSION: no statistical differences were found among genders. The analysis of <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>tokens</b> is more effective than TTR and differentiated statically the ages: 18, 24 and 32 months.

"A dissertation submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (Speech and Hearing Sciences), The University of Hong Kong, June 30, 2010. ""Bidirectional script-sound inconsistency in Chinese"Old perspective of one-way spelling-to-sound (feedforward) inconsistency was challenged and sound-to-spelling (feedback) inconsistency was highlighted in word recognition recently in alphabetic scripts. However, corresponding data on logographic script is lacking. The current study presented statistical data of a newly established data corpus – Hong Kong Corpus of Feedforward and Feedback Consistency (HKCFFC). The data corpus analysis came up with three major findings: 1). Chinese is more feedforward inconsistent than English and French while all three languages are highly feedback inconsistent. 2). Large proportion of feedforward consistent characters in HKCFFC was found feedback inconsistent 3). Strong correlation was shown between <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>token</b> consistency computed. Furthermore, feedback inconsistency computed from <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>token</b> consistency values was examined in a writing-to-dictation task on 30 university students. Significant feedback consistency effect was found in error percent rate.

In the present study, critical objects presented within color images of naturalistic scenes were changed during a saccade toward or away from the target. During the saccade, the critical object was changed to another object type, to a visually different token of the same object type, or was deleted from the scene. There were three main results. First, the deletion of a saccade target was special: Detection performance for saccade target deletions was very good, and this level of performance did not decline with the amplitude of the saccade. In contrast, detection of <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>token</b> changes at the saccade target, and of all changes including deletions at a location that had just been fixated but was not the saccade target, decreased as the amplitude of the saccade increased. Second, detection performance for <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>token</b> changes, both when the changing object was the target of the saccade and when the object had just been fixated but was not the saccade target, was well above chance. Third, mean gaze durations were reliably elevated for those trials in which the change was not overtly detected. The results suggest that the presence of the saccade target plays a special role in transsaccadic integration, and together with other recent findings, suggest more generally that a relatively rich scene representation is retained across saccades and stored in visual memory...|$|E

40|$|Coming {{to grips}} with lexical {{richness}} in spontaneous speech data In spontaneous speech data, lexical richness is generally operationalized by meas-ures in which {{the relation between the}} number of <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>tokens</b> plays a role, of which the Type/Token Ratio (TTR) is the most famous. This article discusses {{the reliability and validity of}} different measures of lexical richness in various language data research and computer simulations, and examines the behaviour of these measures in spontaneous speech data of first language and second language children learning Dutch, aged four to seven, compared with their lexical abilities as measured by tests. The results show that neither the validity nor the reliability of the measures were satisfactory, especially the widely applied TTR. Initially, the number of <b>types,</b> or lemmas, <b>and</b> the Guiraud and Uber indexes seem to be adequate measures. However, in later stages of vocabulary acquisition (from 3000 words on) neither is valid. It is suggested that more effective measures of lexical richness might be based not on the distribution of or the relation between the <b>types</b> <b>and</b> <b>tokens,</b> but on the degree of difficulty of the words used, as measured by their (levels of) frequency in daily language input. ...|$|R

Though the input that children hear is verb-biased rather than noun-biased, children use more nouns than verbs.
