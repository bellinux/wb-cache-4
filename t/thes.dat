25|$|Sometimes the {{opposition}} against God's prophets escalated {{to the point}} of violence and martyrdom, which Jesus and the apostles frequently referenced while preaching to their detractors (Matt 23:31-37, Luke 11:47-51, Acts 7:52, Romans 11:3, 1 <b>Thes</b> 2:15). In this sense, Mormons acknowledge that revelation has not continued uninterrupted throughout history, being that the killing of God's prophets sometimes resulted in periods without church-wide revelation—which Mormons refer to as apostasies. Similar to prophets before them, Peter and the apostles also suffered martyrdom at the hands of their persecutors—with the exception of John who was banished to the Isle of Patmos. In contrast to the Mainstream Christian view that the apostolic era came to a close because revelation had reached its completion, Mormons see it not as God's will but as a tragic result of the overwhelming persecution that plagued the church in that era, which cut short the program of apostolic succession that had commenced when Judas was replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:23-26). The apostasy that followed {{is referred to as the}} Great Apostasy, because it lasted longer than prior periods without prophets.|$|E
