5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried {{the death penalty in}} times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Less {{concrete}} changes {{include the}} growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride {{and a greater}} reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried {{to take advantage of}} the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees {{with a piece of}} equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H) fire. One related method was {{to occupy a}} hamlet or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline on {{the perimeter of the}} hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.|$|E

During her 22 months as agency head, she cut {{the budget of the}} EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regulating.

All the landings, however, were unopposed and the commandos made their way inland to locate and destroy the {{objectives}} they had been assigned.

The commandos, however, did manage to find and destroy an Italian supply dump and an Italian coastal artillery battery before returning to their waiting LCAs to re-embark. The raid would have passed without any loss to the commandos but for the death of a commando officer by friendly fire from an over-alert commando soldier and the capture of 70 men who, after getting lost, ended up on the wrong evacuation beach and became prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} notes, {{the shapes of}} the rest symbols in mensural {{notation}} are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced {{in the course of the}} period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.|$|E
25|$|In the Napoleonic era, {{artillery}} {{became one}} of the three main combat arms, together with infantry and cavalry. Field guns won many battlefield victories. In 1800 French armies employed about two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers. The number increased to as many as five guns per 1,000 by 1812 as the quality of foot soldiers diminished. Under Napoleon batteries usually included eight pieces and the 4-pounder was often employed in advance guards, divisional reserves and horse artillery batteries of the reserve. Frequently, batteries were made up of six cannons and two howitzers. At beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, all armies attached 3- and 4-pounder cannons directly to the infantry units. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> served by trained gunners but in reality they were often worked by infantrymen drafted from the ranks. Each infantry battalion had two 4-pounders attached to it and the guns were frequently called battalion pieces. Partly due to an overall lack of field guns, Napoleon removed the battalion pieces from infantry battalions and combined them into batteries. After his defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling in 1809, Napoleon reversed this policy and rearmed his infantry units with battalion pieces.|$|E

It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that Marissa died and that {{she was the one who}} JR shot. Marissa's father, David, tried to stop JR from pulling the trigger, but the gun misfired. David then threw JR to the floor and shot him and as a result, JR lapsed into a five-year-long coma.

25|$|Shortly after Simeon visited Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe {{returned}} to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title, and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters. In retaliation, Simeon invaded Thrace {{in the summer of}} 914 and captured Adrianople. In 917, a particularly strong Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas, son of Nikephoros Phokas, invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of Romanos Lekapenos, which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. En route to Mesembria (Nesebǎr), where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reinforced by troops transported by the navy, Phokas' forces stopped to rest near the river of Acheloos, not far from the port of Anchialos (Pomorie). Once informed of the invasion, Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines, and he attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized. In the Battle of Achelous (or Anchialus) on 20 August 917, {{one of the largest in}} medieval history, the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders, although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria. As a result of the victory Simeon drew into his orbit the Pecheneg leaders and started a major offensive against the European dominions of Byzantium.
