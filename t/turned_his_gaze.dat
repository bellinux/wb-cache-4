25|$|Next, Suchet <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> toward Valencia. His army {{included}} the infantry divisions of Musnier, Harispe, Habert, Giuseppe Frederico Palombini, Claude Antoine Compère, plus André Joseph Boussart's cavalry division. To these were added the infantry divisions of Honoré Charles Reille and Philippe Eustache Louis Severoli {{to make a}} powerful army of 33,000 men. Suchet planned a double envelopment, with {{the greater part of}} his forces massed inland to cut behind Blake's left flank. Meanwhile, Habert was ordered to break through the Spanish right flank between Valencia and the sea. While minor forces distracted Blake in front, Suchet's pincers closed on the city on 25 December 1811. In the Siege of Valencia, Habert carried out his assignment, scattering José Obispo's troops on the right, while Suchet overran the Spanish left. Blake's flanking troops escaped, but the bulk of his troops were forced into the city where they surrendered on 8 January 1812. For a loss of 2,000 troops the French inflicted horrendous losses on their opponents, 4,011 killed or died of illness plus 16,270 men and 374 guns captured. Only 7,071 Spanish soldiers escaped the trap.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} Thessalonica, {{traditionally}} the second {{city of the}} Byzantine Empire after Constantinople, allowed Theodore to challenge the Nicaean claims on the Byzantine imperial title. With {{the support of the}} bishops of his domains, he was crowned emperor at Thessalonica by the Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatenos. The date is unknown, but has been placed either in 1225 or in 1227/8. Having openly declared his imperial ambitions, Theodore <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> onto Constantinople. Only the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes, and the Bulgarian emperor Ivan II Asen were strong enough to challenge him. In a bid to preempt Theodore, the Nicaeans seized Adrianople from the Latins in 1225, but Theodore quickly marched into Thrace and forced the Nicaeans to leave their European possessions to him. Theodore was free to assault Constantinople, but for unknown reasons delayed this attack. In the meantime, the Nicaeans and Latins had settled their differences, and although formally allied with Theodore, Ivan II Asen also entered talks for a dynastic alliance between the Latin Empire and Bulgaria. In 1230, Theodore finally marched against Constantinople, but unexpectedly turned his army north into Bulgaria instead. In the ensuing Battle of Klokotnitsa, Theodore's army was destroyed and he himself taken captive and later blinded.|$|E
2500|$|By 1580, {{not only}} had the [...] "universal ruler" [...] subdued all the {{countries}} which had occupied his attention {{for the last three}} decades but he also had the respect from neighboring states. He faced no internal or external threats (although Portuguese Goa considered it was technically at war with Burma for her interference in Ceylon). Instead of resting, he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> on Arakan, the kingdom he and Tabinshwehti unsuccessfully tried to conquer in 1545–1547. He determined that it was now time to reduce the western coastal kingdom to the vassal status it held under the Pagan kings once more. A year earlier, he had sent an embassy to Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire, which had just acquired Bengal in 1576, perhaps to ascertain whether his occupation of Arakan would be viewed as an act of hostility to the Mughals.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the power}} he had acquired, in 879, he <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> on Mosul in the Jazira, an area plagued by rivalries among the Arab tribal chiefs—chiefly the various Taghlibi leaders, who succeeded {{one another as}} rulers of Mosul—and an ongoing Kharijite rebellion. Ibn Kundaj succeeded in {{defeating}} the current ruler of Mosul, Ali ibn Dawud, and taking the city. To the local Arab tribes of Taghlib and Bakr, who had been accustomed to wide autonomy from the central government during the [...] "Anarchy at Samarra", the appearance of Ibn Kundaj and his occupation of Mosul represented an unacceptable intrusion. Ibn Kundaj defeated one of them, Ishaq ibn Ayyub, and seized the latter's stronghold of Nisibis, but Ibn Ayyub appealed for aid to the Shaybanid Isa ibn al-Shaykh of Amid and Abu al-Maghra' ibn Musa ibn Zurarah of Arzen. The coalition prepared to strike against Ibn Kundaj, but the arrival of emissaries from Baghdad confirming him as governor over Mosul, Diyar Rabi'a and Armenia forced them to back down and agree to pay a tribute of 200,000 gold dinars.|$|E

60|$|To-day White Chief, as Girty was called, awaited his men. A slight tremor of {{the ground}} caused him to <b>turn</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze.</b> The Huron chief, Half King, resplendent in his {{magnificent}} array, had entered the teepee. He squatted in a corner, rested the bowl of his great pipe on his knee, and smoked in silence. The habitual frown of his black brow, like a shaded, overhanging cliff; the fire flashing from his eyes, as a shining light is reflected from a dark pool; his closely-shut, bulging jaw, all bespoke a nature, lofty in its Indian pride and arrogance, but more cruel than death.|$|R

To the eyes of the Woggle-Bug nothing could be more beautiful, and he positively regretted the necessity of ever <b>turning</b> <b>his</b> <b>gaze</b> from this bewitching treasure.|$|R
