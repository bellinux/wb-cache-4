5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq {{has said}} of his {{creative}} intentions with the follow-up, [...] "I’ve never shut my ears to anything, really. It’s not like I’m always looking for things, either, but I can’t close my ears to any music. Any guitar, any drums, any rhythm section— I’ve always been open to those things, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> makes them work in a song". He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life. That's what I've done my whole career—taking chances with different styles of music and making choices that other people would be afraid to take. Stone Rollin means I'm {{going all the way}} out there this time".|$|E

[...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, The Wall Street Journal {{published}} an article by the Estonian defense minister Urmas Reinsalu, titled [...] "Georgian Democracy and Russian Meddling". Reinsalu argued: [...] "In Tallinn—and hopefully in Brussels, Paris and Washington as well—we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Russia expects to gain by occupying Georgian territory. Does the Kremlin believe that a country is excluded from NATO membership just because a fifth of its territory is occupied?

2500|$|Cocker is also {{renowned for}} his wit and {{observations}} of the cultural scene. He was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1990s, and hosted an art series for Channel 4 – [...] "Journeys into the Outside". In the series, he took a trip across the globe, meeting so-called [...] "outsider artists", people who create wacky and wonderful works of art, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> compelled them to do so. Cocker's penchant for TV appearances was reflected in a parody of [...] "Common People" [...] ("Showbiz People") which was featured on the satirical comedy show Spitting Image in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|The philosopher Helmut Fleischer, in {{an essay}} first {{published}} in the Nürnberger Zeitung newspaper on September 20, 1986, defended Nolte against Habermas {{on the grounds that}} Nolte was only seeking to place the Holocaust into a wider political context of the time. Fleischer accused Habermas of seeking to impose on Germans a left-wing moral understanding of the Nazi period and of creating a “moral” Sondergericht (Special Court). Fleischer argued that Nolte was only seeking the [...] "historicization" [...] of National Socialism that Martin Broszat had called for in a 1985 essay by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> caused National Socialism, with a special focus on the fear of communism.|$|E

People bore with him a long time; but when he took a lively trot {{down the middle of the}} long dinner-table one day, after eating all he liked, and smashing right and left as he scampered off, with a terrible clatter of silver, glass, and china, his angry master declared he wouldn't have such doings, and chained him to a post on the lawn.

Hearing the lessons he gives to others has {{interested}} and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray him.|$|E
6000|$|After a while Whibley {{bought a}} table, and {{encouraged}} it to launch out into more active conversation. To please Whibley, I assisted {{at some of}} the earlier seances, but during my presence it invariably maintained a reticence bordering on positive dulness. I gathered from Whibley that it disliked me, thinking that I was unsympathetic. The complaint was unjust; I was not unsympathetic, at least not at the commencement. I came to hear it talk, and I wanted to hear it talk; I would have listened to it by the hour. What tired me was its slowness in starting, and its foolishness when it had started, in using long words that it {{did not know how to}} spell. I remember on one occasion, Whibley, Jobstock (Whibley's partner), and myself, sitting for two hours, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the thing meant by [...] "H-e-s-t-u-r-n-e-m-y-s-f-e-a-r."

On {{the other}} hand this long contentment with {{inferior}} work, and the consequent acute enjoyment of whatever was the least suggestive of truth in a higher degree, rendered me long careless of the highest virtues of execution, and retarded by many years the maturing and balancing of the general power of judgment. And I am now, as I said, quite unable to imagine {{what would have been}} the result upon me, of being enabled to study, instead of these coarse vignettes, such lovely and expressive work as that of Watson; suppose, for instance, the vignette at p. 87, which would have been sure to have caught my fancy, because of the dog, with its head on Crusoe's knee, looking up and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> is the matter with his master. It remains to be seen, and can only be known by experience, what will actually be the effect of these treasures on the minds of children that possess them. The result must be in some sort different from anything yet known; no such art was ever yet attainable by the youth of any nation. Yet of this there can, as I have just said, be no reasonable doubt;--that it is not well to make the imagination indolent, or take its work out of its hands by supplying continual pictures of what might be sufficiently conceived without pictures.|$|E
