40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} mobile network competition on the prices of fixed-to-mobile calls. Because fixed line customers cannot, in general, distinguish {{the identity of a}} specific mobile network, these networks have market power when setting <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> for calls from fixed lines. We show that: (1) unregulated mobile <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> will result in higher than monopoly call prices; (2) the regulation of <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> and prices downward will affect mobile subscription rates and may lower these rates; and (3) regulation of any mobile carrier’s <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> can reduce fixed to mobile prices but will result in an increase in unregulated carriers’ <b>termination</b> <b>charges.</b> When fixed line consumers can distinguish between the different mobile networks they are calling, fixed to mobile call prices will fall relative to their level under customer ignorance. Direct mobile <b>charging</b> for <b>termination</b> also exerts downward pressure on the total fixed to mobile call price.

We incorporate the idea of partial consumer ignorance when calling to a mobile user and allow the network operator to discriminate between on-net and off-net calls by setting differential calling prices. Compared to the uniform <b>termination</b> <b>charge</b> and asymmetric regulation, it is shown in this paper that the regulator can improve social welfare, without too much intervention, by imposing reciprocity on termination charges. We also find that with stronger consumer ignorance the regulator is more capable of improving social welfare.

So it can neither threaten to raise the mobile-to-xed <b>termination</b> <b>charge,</b> nor to refuse to terminate the call.

40|$|In many {{countries}} {{there is widespread}} concern {{at the level of}} mobile <b>termination</b> <b>charges.</b> This is attributable to the bottleneck monopoly created by the Calling Party Pays (CPP) principle. It has led to increasingly severe price controls on <b>termination</b> <b>charges.</b> Regulatory experience in the three foremost such countries (UK, Australia and New Zealand) suggests that price controls are of limited effectiveness in aligning <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> with costs, that net welfare gains from controls are small and that costs of setting controls are high. The Receiving Party Pays (RPP) principle, which applies in North America and several Asian countries, avoids the bottleneck monopoly problem. After allowing for various economic and technical average revenue (price) per call is significantly lower with RPP, average minutes of usage per subscriber are significantly higher and the mobile penetration rate is not significantly different. Handset subsidies seem to be lower in the US (with RPP) than in the UK (with CPP). Surprisingly, CPP regulators have either ignored RPP or rejected it for various alleged disadvantages. These do not withstand investigation. However, in CPP countries there is still concern about the idea of paying to receive calls. There is a way to get the benefits associated with RPP without this disadvantage. RPP is based on a 'bill and keep' regime. Some mobile operators in RPP countries are now offering customers the option of calling plans with free incoming calls. Changing to a 'bill and keep' regime would avoid the bottleneck monopoly and associated distortions of conventional CPP regimes, yet enable operators and customers themselves to choose how to pay for calls [...] in effect, to choose between CPP and RPP.

We develop two models, the first that involves fixed market shares and the second, {{based on the work}} of Laffont, Rey and Tirole (1998 a), which allows for subscriber competition. We show that if a dominant network (i. e., one with the greatest market share) has its termination charges regulated then this will tend to lower the average price of calls. It is also likely to lead to other networks raising their termination charges. If market shares are fixed, then extending termination regulation to non-dominant networks lowers call prices and is unambiguously welfare improving. However, if networks actively compete for subscribers then extending <b>termination</b> <b>charge</b> regulation to a non-dominant network may lead to higher call prices.

First, we consider a benchmark where mobile-tofixed termination rates are regulated at cost and fixed and mobile network operators negotiate the fixed-to-mobile termination rate.

The sudden growth in mobile telephony market revealed regulatory needs in particular services. The crucial service that regulators mainly focus was Mobile Termination service since it was identified that operators have monopoly power in termination service. By this identification, a debate on whether mobile termination rates need to be regulated arose. This master thesis exemines the debate in detail. Some argue that mobile termination rates are high and high termination rates may cause some market failures. To understand whether mobile termination rates are high, the incentives of the mobile operator: are discussed. Mobile operators have different incentives to set high <b>termination</b> <b>charges</b> for fixed-to-mobile (FTM) and mobile-to-mobile (MTM) calls.

In particular, when the quality of a network has an impact on all calls initiated by own customers (destined both on-net and off-net), we obtain a result of ‘tacit collusion’ even in a symmetric model with two-part pricing.
