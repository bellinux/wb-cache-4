40|$|Abstract. This study {{focuses on}} the {{contribution}} of sentence length for a quan-titative <b>text</b> <b>typology.</b> Therefore, 333 Slovenian texts are analyzed {{with regard to their}} sentence length. By way of multivariate discriminant analyses it is shown that indeed, a <b>text</b> <b>typology</b> is possible, based on sentence length, only; this typology, however, does not coincide with traditional text classifications, such as, e. g., text sorts or functional style. Rather, a new categorization into specific discourse types seems reaonable. 1 Sentence length and text classification: methodological remarks Text research, based on quantitative methods, is characterized by two ma-jor spheres of interest: (1) quantitative text classification, in general (cf., e. g., Alekseev 1988), and (2) authorship discrimination and attribution of disputed authorship, in particular (cf., e. g., Smith 1983). Both lines of re-search are closely interrelated and share the common interest to identify and quantify specific text characteristics, with sentence length playing a crucia...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} whether the traditional <b>text</b> <b>typologies</b> suggested by (corpus-) linguists might apply to web pages. By traditional <b>text</b> <b>typologies</b> we mean both those text types worked out by text linguists (Werlich 1976), and those derived using a statistical and corpus-based approach (Biber 1988). We illustrate {{the problems that}} arose {{when we tried to}} derive text types from a sample of web pages belonging to the SPIRIT collection (Clarke et al. 1998) using simple heuristics and a set of linguistic features. The SPIRIT collection is multilingual and without any meta-information, except a short header including the original URL, the date and time when the pages were crawled from the Web, and few other details. It is not provided with any morphological or syntactic annotation, nor is balanced with respect to genres or registers. This collection represents a genuine random slice of the real Web, "frozen " for research purposes. Two hundred web pages written in English were randomly chosen and used in this experiment. The analysis of the results led to the following conclusions: 1) Parsing a raw web page (i. e. a web page saved in a text-only format) may return an unreliable output. Some pre-processing might be needed, especially when ending punctuation marks are missing. For example, headings, which usually are not marked by an ending period, are ofte...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{dissertation}} is to describe Neo-Babylonian legal procedure by studying legal teats relevant to the adjudicatory process. It seeks to answer the main question: How were cases adjudicated in the Neo-Babylonian period? Part I of the dissertation the Neo-Babylonian primary sources, which attest to the adjudicatory process, into different text-types. This detailed <b>text</b> <b>typology</b> results from {{an analysis of the}} different legal functions inherently reflected in the texts. It begins with a discussion of the decision records, which describe the adjudicatory process from its initiation through the final decision. The typological discussion then considers other text-types that are relevant to the adjudicatory process, such as preliminary protocols, depositions, and summonses. The dissertation then synthesizes the results of the <b>text</b> <b>typology</b> into a description of Neo-Babylonian adjudicatory procedure. To do so, it follows the adjudication of cases between private individuals as well as the prosecution of crimes against the Eanna. It describes the procedures that are undertaken and the Akkadian legal terminology associated with each procedure. The dissertation concludes by considering some directions for comparative study. ...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePresented in {{this paper}} are some {{preliminary}} analyses concerning Ghaznavid epigraphic production in Persian. Although {{the great majority of}} Islamic inscriptions from Ghazni are in Arabic, some occurrences attest the use of Persian from the early 12 th century onwards. This documentation is highly-valued due to the early-dating and the variety in <b>text</b> <b>typologies</b> and writing styles. Some evidences highlight the spread of Persian inscriptions within the architectural decoration of Ghaznavid buildings, the most extraordinary example being the poem carved in the Palace courtyard. In civilian epigraphy Persian appears mostly in poetic texts, while official and religious inscriptions are always in Arabic. Instead in funerary epigraphy Arabic and Persian often co-exist on the same monument and even get combined in single inscriptions. However, few occurrences exist of poetical epitaphs entirely in Persian. The insertion of Persian invocations on tombs also emerges in post-Ghaznavid production, reflecting the local Iranian linguistic identity...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of competence-based teaching, this paper draws upon the model of Translation Competence (TC) put forward by the PACTE group (2003) to {{establish}} a dialogue between cognitive-constructivist paradigms for translation teaching and {{the model of the}} Context-based <b>Text</b> <b>Typology</b> (MATTHIESSEN et al., 2007). In this theoretical environment, it proposes a model for the design of a Teaching Unit (TU) {{for the development of the}} bilingual competence in would-be-translators. To this end, it explores translation as a cognitive, communicative and textual activity (HURTADO ALBIR, 2011) and considers its teaching from the translation task-based approach (HURTADO ALBIR, 1999). This approach is illustrated through the practical example of the design of a TU elaborated for the subject ‘Introduction to Specialized Translation’,part of the curricular grid of the program ‘Secretariado Executivo’ at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. Aspects such as the establishment of learning objectives and their alignment with the translation tasks composing the TU are addressed for this specific pedagogical situation. We argue for the development of textual competences by means of the acquisition of strategies derived from the Context-based <b>Text</b> <b>Typology</b> to solve problems arising from the translation of different text types and contextual configurations...|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{corpus of}} texts {{that are used}} to teach {{seminars}} in translation into the foreign language, the present paper argues that for future translators good reading skills are almost as important as high-level proficiency in both languages. The corpus comprises texts that share a common topic (travelling) but differ in terms of genre, so that the specific characteristics of each text can be described in relation to the other component texts rather than to abstract text types included in <b>text</b> <b>typologies.</b> The exercises in the seminars, before actually starting to translate, aimed at reading a text at different levels, i. e. the text as a whole, its discursive dynamics, and its component parts, while trying to connect it to the other texts included in the corpus. The preparatory exploration of the source text as well as the actual process of translation can be conceptualized as the Game of the Goose (or Snakes and Ladders) : translators have to find their way through the text, taking advantage from short cuts and anticipating pitfalls they already know from past experiences...|$|R
40|$|Translation {{is a very}} broad, {{complex and}} multi-faceted phenomenon, {{encompassing}} much more factors than it seems at first glance. It is not just copying the words from the original work while changing the language, but it consists of a careful selection of appropriate phrases and expressions, combining them together in a skillful way while taking into consideration numerous aspects, one of them being the text type. The {{purpose of this article}} is, therefore, to present various <b>text</b> <b>typologies</b> and <b>text</b> types, specify their implications for translators and determine the role of the correct recognition of text type in producing a successful translation. This will be done on the assumption that a text type is one of the basic factors that allow the translator to recognise the function and purpose of the text as well as the author's intention. Thus, depending on the nature of these, the translator will inevitably resort to different techniques and strategies in order to successfully render the source text. Therefore, identifying the text type also helps the translator to select the appropriate translation strategy...|$|R

40|$|Global {{communication}} between peoples has accelerated exponentially since the digital {{revolution of the}} eighties. Better and faster technological channels for communicating information across the globe, {{have led to a}} handful of languages taking centre stage, with English holding the lion’s share in the fields of international business and science communication. We communicate through written and spoken modes of discourse via telephony, the Internet, DVDs, CD-ROMs and the media. Much of our communicative frenzy is conducted through the production of written <b>text</b> <b>typologies</b> directly accessible only to those able to read and to understand the major languages involved in the global exchange of information and ideas. Alternatively, the translation of kilometres of script provides the rest of humanity with access to the realities of our multilinguistic, multicultural, modern world. Likewise, babble in many tongues crosses oceans and the ionosphere in a constant cacophony of sounds; but it is not accessible to all. Across the world, it is estimated that there live around 70 million deaf or seriously hearing-impaired people who experience a constant state of silence and are cut off from much communication by an invisible physiological barrier: deafness. The profoundly deaf and hard-of-hearing live and work like their fellow citizens, but constantly have to adjust to sound deprivation in order to communicate beyond the self.

40|$|This thesis {{will discuss}} the {{differences}} between professional and non-professional Dutch and English texts informing the readers {{of the dangers of}} sugar and tobacco consumption. While the hazards of smoking are widely known, the anti-sugar lobby is a fairly recent phenomenon. The thesis demonstrates how this has affected the articles written about either subject. The analyses in the first chapter reveal several differences between professional and non-professional texts as well as Dutch and English texts, especially where the use deixis and modal verbs are concerned. It pays special attention to the various persuasion strategies used by the authors, which are not only influenced by {{the manner in which the}} author is involved in the issue, but also by the audience’s culture. The second chapter indentifies and attempts to solve the various translation problems which occur on pragmatic, cultural, linguistic and text-specific levels when translating articles into the Target Language. Chapter three contains a critical analysis of the translation tool used to identify the articles’ text type: the Text Type Triangle by Dr. Chesterman, which is based on the nowadays outdated <b>text</b> <b>typology</b> developed by Katharina Reiss. Reiss’s <b>text</b> <b>typology,</b> and in extension the Triangle, was developed long before the Internet, which has a profound effect on the manner in which people communicate, became available to the average person.

Four pairwise comparisons of part-of-speech frequencies were made: written language vs. spoken language; informative writing vs. imaginative writing; conversational speech vs. ‘task-oriented ’ speech; and imaginative writing vs. ‘task-oriented ’ speech. The following variation gradient was hypothesized: conversation – task-oriented speech – imaginative writing – informative writing; however, the actual progression was: conversation – imaginative writing – task-oriented speech – informative writing. It thus seems that genre and medium interact in a more complex way than originally hypothesized. However, this conclusion has been {{made on the basis}} of broad, pre-existing text types within the BNC, and, in future, the internal structure of these text types may need to be addressed. ...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{and digital}} devices have changed {{ordinary}} communication {{as much as}} modified literary discourse. Since the mid- 90 s, people have gradually relied on emails, while to rethink the creative process writers have used the Internet and exploited or imported Internet communications in their writings. All sorts of contaminations have generated yet more hybrid narratives as authors re-mediated discourse patterns {{in an attempt to}} re-present and capture a new highly mediated reality. Given its revolutionary character, not surprisingly, the epistolary novel {{has been the subject of}} a revival with 20 th- and 21 stcentury works classified as such in a diverse production 57. The increasing variety of such literary production has triggered an investigation on the impact of the electronic tools and digital media on contemporary electronic-mail novels, i. e. e-novels. Thus, I decided to concentrate my attention on a noteworthy specimen of e-pistolarity, e 2 A novel (2010) by British novelist Matt Beaumont. With its striking visual impact and similarly extravagant collection of layouts, in e 2 A novel, emails and other ecorrespondences re-model the plot development, reshape communicative practice and hence remediate literary discourse. Five major aspects re-fashion the genre in Beaumont: a new topic; a set of different <b>text</b> <b>typologies,</b> their distinctive linguistic functions and features; an altered understanding of time and space; new and enhanced pragmatics between correspondents; and a rethinking of the writer/reader relationship chiselled in a minimal set of typographic elements and an essential if crucial framed narrative...|$|R
