5|$|Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> is a 2001 American {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren. The sixth film {{produced in the}} Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> franchise, it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel {{of the same name}} and the 1968 film version. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. <b>The</b> <b>apes</b> treat humans as slaves, but {{with the help of an}} ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} cameo {{appearances}} by Charlton Heston (uncredited) as Zaius, Thade's father, and Linda Harrison (the {{woman in the}} cart). Both participated in two original films in the series, Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> (1968) and Beneath the Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> (1970) as George Taylor and Nova, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "ape" [...] was {{actually}} a three-foot-tall chimpanzee who was made to appear gigantic with camera trickery and perspective shots. When Echo removes <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> from his cage, the shot shows Echo (with his back turned to the camera) unlocking the cage and walking <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> to <b>the</b> truck. <b>The</b> <b>ape</b> appears to be roughly {{the same size as}} Echo. This effect was achieved by having midget actor Harry Earles (who played [...] "Tweedledee" [...] in the film) play Echo for these brief shots, and then cutting to Chaney, making it seem as though <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> is gigantic.

5|$|Development for a Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> remake {{started as}} far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the {{pre-production}} stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. <b>The</b> <b>apes</b> have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of <b>the</b> <b>apes</b> were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The Oberon's log {{reveals that}} <b>the</b> <b>apes</b> on board, led by Semos, {{organized}} a mutiny and {{took control of}} the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. <b>The</b> <b>apes</b> arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he is able to even the odds when he uses the Oberons last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle is halted as a familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles, the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was, and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, <b>the</b> <b>apes</b> interpret his arrival as the return of Semos, the first ape, who is their god. They bow, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.|$|E
5|$|With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Burton {{was hired}} as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> was {{released}} to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised. Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{additional}} idea on {{the origins}} of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from <b>the</b> <b>ape.</b> Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from <b>apes.</b> <b>The</b> closest relative to the human species is <b>the</b> African <b>ape.</b> [...] At birth, <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. <b>The</b> world <b>the</b> <b>ape</b> is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in <b>the</b> <b>ape's</b> life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of belongingness, which is derived from its dependence on <b>the</b> <b>ape's</b> mother and family. Belongingness is defined as [...] "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships." [...] This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the hominid (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of <b>the</b> <b>ape,</b> which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.|$|R

5|$|Ape Escape is a {{platform}} game that is viewed from a third-person perspective. Players traverse several different environments to advance through the game. For {{most of the}} game, players control Spike—a boy tasked with pursuing and capturing <b>the</b> <b>apes</b> across time, preventing them from rewriting history. Players use various gadgets to pursue and capture <b>the</b> <b>apes,</b> such as the Stun Club, used as an offensive measure against enemies, and the Time Net, used to capture apes and transport them to present day. More gadgets become available as players progress through the game. Players also control vehicles throughout the game, including a rubber raft, which allows travel over water, and the water net, which assists in traversing underwater. The game's controls are heavily centered around the analog sticks: the left stick is used to move players, while the right stick manipulates the various gadgets.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes</b> (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of <b>the</b> <b>Apes,</b> to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

Another excellent specimen of the modern zany is <b>the</b> curate, who <b>apes</b> <b>the</b> rector, who <b>apes</b> <b>the</b> bishop, who <b>apes</b> <b>the</b> archbishop, who <b>apes</b> <b>the</b> devil.|$|R

Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E
