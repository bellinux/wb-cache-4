5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> lost playmaker Bob Cousy to {{retirement}} after the 1962–63 season, but they drafted John Havlicek. Once again, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> were powered by Russell, who averaged 16.8 points and 23.6 rebounds per game, won his fourth regular-season MVP title, and earned MVP honors at the 1963 NBA All-Star Game following his 19-point, 24-rebound {{performance for the}} East. <b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> reached the 1963 NBA Finals, where they again defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, this time in six games.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly out of bounds, but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going out of bounds, and <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> maintained possession.|$|E

5|$|According to Johnson {{this was}} his {{favorite}} play of all-time. Games 6 and 7 also featured a feud, this time between Pistons forward Dennis Rodman and Johnson. In Game 6, which the Pistons won, Rodman taunted Johnson in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> took Game 7, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments {{of the game and}} mimicked his taunting gesture. In the 1987 NBA Finals, however, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> succumbed to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 as Lakers playmaker and Finals MVP Magic Johnson put up a great performance, averaging 26 points and 13 assists throughout the series.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> won 14 {{straight}} games, and continued to succeed. Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game. An interesting phenomenon began that year: Russell was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player, but only named to the All-NBA Second Team. This would occur repeatedly throughout his career. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell, but no player was more valuable to his team. <b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> won 49 games and easily made the first berth in the 1958 NBA Playoffs, and made the 1958 NBA Finals against their familiar rivals, the St. Louis Hawks. The teams split the first two games, but then Russell went down with a foot injury in Game 3 and only returned for Game 6. <b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> surprisingly won Game 4, but the Hawks prevailed in Games 5 and 6, with Pettit scoring 50 points in the deciding Game 6.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956–57 NBA season, Auerbach {{acquired}} two future Hall-of-Famers: forward Tom Heinsohn, {{and defensive}} center Bill Russell. Powered by these new recruits, <b>the</b> <b>Celtics</b> went 44–28 {{in the regular}} season, and Cousy averaged 20.6 points, 4.8 rebounds and a league-leading 7.5 assists, earning his first NBA Most Valuable Player Award; he also won his second NBA All-Star Game MVP award. <b>The</b> <b>Celtics</b> reached the 1957 NBA Finals, and powered by Cousy on offense and rugged center Russell on defense, they beat the Hawks 4–3, who were noted for future Hall-of-Fame power forward Bob Pettit and former teammates Macauley and Hagan. Cousy finally won his first title.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rise}} of the Knicks, the 1974 {{championship}} returned to <b>the</b> <b>Celtics,</b> as a newly formed cohort of players led by Dave Cowens demonstrated excellent teamwork and resilience to win in seven games to secure another title.|$|E
