6000|$|Bertha {{seized the}} moment to put a {{question}} she had been minded many times to ask. [...] "Lucius, what's <b>your</b> <b>plan?</b> You can't intend to do this all <b>your</b> life? <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> ambition--maybe we can help you." ...|$|R
60|$|JOANNA (genially). Of {{course you}} did. But never mind that; do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you are to}} help, too, Fred; you and Alexander are to {{come and}} reach the high places for <b>us.</b> But do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> adventures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{just going}} to order {{something}} here,' said the Quaker; 'but in the meantime, have you any objection, my good friend, to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name?' ...|$|R
60|$|ADAM. That is very true. You must <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> secret. You see, Eve, what {{a splendid}} thing {{it is not}} to have to live for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> part of it?" [...] cried Barbara Vane, whose air of sunny {{sleepiness}} {{seemed in}} some vague degree {{to have fallen}} from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, {{when they}} had all reseated themselves, [...] "you must really <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story, captain. You know I have heard nothing yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Latham," [...] Dick said {{presently}} to {{the officer}} {{in command of the}} cavalry, [...] "will you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> adventures? We know all about each other's doings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will do our best," [...] they answered; [...] "but let us talk no more {{of these}} things which are the decree of God--lest we should go mad. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, sis, sich {{a steady}} gale o' talkin', {{right behind the}} sail, is bound to hurry the boat along. And now, s'pose you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name," [...] said Menendez.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I too," [...] {{the major}} said. [...] "There {{was not one}} of us but would have fought to the death for Leslie. And now sit down, my lad, while Anderson <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am. I am," [...] said Lord Marshmoreton hastily. [...] "The maid replied: 'They're at the wash.' Of course I am. Go on, Percy. Good God, boy, don't {{take all}} day <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> adventures, {{and why you}} {{vanished}} away so mysteriously {{four years}} ago," [...] she said, {{with a touch of}} the childish imperiousness in her voice, though her frank eyes fell before his.|$|R
6000|$|... "To Haarlem. The Spaniards {{are closing}} in upon the city, and we dare {{not try to}} break through their lines. Those are Spanish boats behind us. But eat and drink a little, Elsa, then <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> about <b>your</b> {{experience}} in software development.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Mat, leave off smoking, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> something," [...] {{interposed}} Zack. [...] "Bowl away at {{once with}} one of your tremendous stories, or Blyth will be bragging again about his rickety old legs. Talk, man! <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> famous story of how you lost your scalp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> sins," [...] {{she called}} out. [...] "Come {{and have them}} forgiven. Come and {{start a new life}} in a new world. There is no one here who thinks of the past. Come and seek forgiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Madam, we want {{breakfast at}} {{whatever}} hour it suits {{you to give}} it, from {{four in the morning}} till four in the afternoon!’ I cried. ‘Only <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> figure, if your mouth be large enough to let it out!’ ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Madam, we want {{breakfast at}} {{whatever}} hour it suits {{you to give}} it, from {{four in the morning}} till four in the afternoon!" [...] I cried. [...] "Only <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> figure, if your mouth be large enough to let it out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend, Mr. Clyffurde, an English gentleman," [...] said Victor de Marmont hastily in {{response}} to a quick look of suspicious enquiry which flashed out from under Emery's bushy eyebrows.

6000|$|... "Now, Harry," [...] {{his uncle}} said briskly, [...] "I will give orders {{to have your}} things {{taken out of the}} post chaise, and carried up to your room.

6000|$|... "Damsel," [...] quoth King Arthur, [...] "it is very {{singular}} {{that you}} should {{know who we are}} and that we should not know you. Now, will you not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name and whence you come and whither you go? For of a surety I believe you are Fay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] {{the prince}} said smiling. [...] "I must hear your story {{with all its}} details; but as it is doubtless {{somewhat}} long, I must put it off until later. After the evening meal you shall <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> adventures before I betake myself to my work." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} {{commodore}} smiled and pulled meditatively {{at the little}} goatee he wore. [...] "Russell, you can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story in detail. But do not take over ten minutes," [...] he said, and covered his eyes with his hands, as if in deep thought--one of his favorite attitudes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, young sir, {{who seem}} as witty {{as you are}} good looking, you may, if you will, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name and your business. As for the name, however, {{if you wish to}} keep it to yourself, Ranald Sigtrygsson is not the man to demand it of an honest guest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which they {{surely have}} done by now," [...] broke in Masouda quietly, [...] "though I do not pity them, who were wicked. Nay; thank me not; I {{have done what}} I promised to do, neither less nor more, and--I love danger and a high stake. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story, Sir Godwin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Malchus, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story," [...] Hannibal said. [...] "It seems {{strange to}} me that you should have said nought to your father or me of what you had learned, and left us to take such {{measures}} as might seem fit to us, instead of taking the matter into your own hands." ...|$|R

6000|$|It gave me {{a little}} check. [...] "Ah! {{it was a sad}} scene my love" [...] I says, [...] "and sad remembrances come back {{stronger}} than merry.

6000|$|... 'Isabel!' cried {{a bright}} voice, {{and a girl}} of {{fourteen}} came skating along the polished oak corridor. 'Come and have some tea in the school-room, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> adventures!' And so saying, she dragged the dignified Isabel into an old-fashioned sitting-room, where a little pale child, two years younger, sprang up, and, with a cry of joy, clung round the elder sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you begin}} to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story, young sir, we should be glad {{to know how it}} is that you speak our {{language}} so well; for indeed we could not tell by your accent that you are not a native of these parts, which is of course impossible, seeing that your father is an Englishman and captain of the ship lying off there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we {{answer that}} {{question}} we wish to ask a few on our account," [...] returned Andy. [...] "Now <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> who <b>your</b> companions were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Do not be angry, strangers; {{the sailor}} boys must have their jest. But we will treat you justly and kindly, for strangers and poor men come from God; and you seem no common sailors by your strength, and height, and weapons. Come {{up with me}} to the palace of Alcinous, the rich sea-going king, and we will feast you well and heartily; and after that you shall <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> name.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's {{nothing to}} be afraid of, my dear,' said Uncle Reginald, tenderly; 'nobody {{suspects}} you of anything. Only <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> Did <b>your</b> father give you this paper?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A wondrous weapon," [...] said Ragnar {{when he had}} {{examined}} it, [...] "though somewhat {{heavy for}} its length, and of bronze, after the fashion of those that are buried in the grave mounds. It has seen much wear also, and, I should say, has loosed many a spirit. Look at the gold work of the handle. Truly a wondrous weapon, worth all the necklaces in the world. But <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> story." ...|$|R
