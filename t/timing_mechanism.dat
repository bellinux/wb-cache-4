40|$|Virtually {{all species}} have {{developed}} cellular oscillations and mechanisms that synchronize these cellular oscillations to environmental cycles. Such environmental cycles in biotic (e. g. food availability and predation risk) or abiotic (e. g. temperature and light) factors may occur on a daily, annual or tidal time scale. Internal <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may facilitate behavioural or physiological adaptation to such changes in environmental conditions. These <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> commonly involve an internal molecular oscillator (a ‘clock’) that is synchronized (‘entrained’) {{to the environmental}} cycle by receptor mechanisms responding to relevant environmental signals (‘Zeitgeber’, i. e. German for time-giver). To understand the evolution of such <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> {{we have to understand}} the mechanisms leading to selective advantage. Although major advances have been made in our understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms driving internal cycles (proximate questions), studies identifying mechanisms of natural selection on clock systems (ultimate questions) are rather limited. Here, we discuss the selective advantage of a circadian system and how its adaptation to day length variation may have a functional role in optimizing seasonal timing. We discuss various cases where selective advantages of circadian <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been shown and cases where temporarily loss of circadian timing may cause selective advantage. We suggest an explanation for why a circadian timing system has emerged in primitive life forms like cyanobacteria and we evaluate a possible molecular mechanism that enabled these bacteria to adapt to seasonal variation in day length. We further discuss how the role of the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement may explain differential selection pressures on circadian period when species are exposed to changing climatic conditions (e. g. global warming) or when they expand their geographical range to different latitudes or altitudes. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} pointing to the existence of modality-specific <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for encoding sub-second durations. For example, the duration compression effect describes how prior adaptation to a dynamic visual stimulus results in participants underestimating the duration of a sub-second test stimulus when it is presented at the adapted location. There is substantial evidence for the existence of both cortical and pre- cortical visual timing mechanisms; however little is known about where in the processing hierarchy the cortical mechanisms are likely to be located. We carried out a series of experiments {{to determine whether or not}} <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are to be found at the global processing level. We had participants adapt to random dot patterns that varied in their motion coherence, thus allowing us to probe the visual system at the level of motion integration. Our first experiment revealed a positive linear relationship between the motion coherence level of the adaptor stimulus and duration compression magnitude. However, increasing the motion coherence level in a stimulus also results in an increase in global speed. To test whether duration compression effects were driven by global speed or global motion we repeated the experiment, but kept global speed fixed while varying motion coherence levels. The duration compression persisted, but the linear relationship with motion coherence was absent, suggesting that the effect was driven by adapting global speed mechanisms. Our results support previous claims that visual <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> persist at the level of global processing. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on {{presently}} available commercial operating systems. Two operating system platforms that immediately {{come to mind}} are the Microsoft Windows environment (the WIN 32 platform) and its UNIX-based counterpart, Linux (with its POSIX standard). The <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> under these operating systems are adequate for use in conventional multimedia applications currently run on these platforms. However, the requirements of such applications are not as stringent within a real-time environment. The goal of this dissertation {{was to determine if}} {{it would be possible to}} find a workaround for applications where current <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the WIN 32 and POSIX environments do not meet the requirements of real-time. Before a proposed workaround is presented, a clarification is given as to what is meant by the notion of a timer. Attention is also given to the fact that its accuracy is quantified in terms of its resolution. It is acknowledged that real-time extensions to both the Windows and Linux operating systems exist. However, it was decided to find a solution without such assistance. Real-time is also defined and sub-classified into hard- and soft real-time, differentiating environments that have precise constraints (hard real-time) on timing as opposed to environments where demands on accuracy and efficiency are less stringent (soft real-time). The timer that was ultimately implemented had to conform to the latter form of real-time. This dissertation therefore aims to provide a solution in a soft real-time environment. The current <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are discussed and their performance is quantified. Their deficiency in measuring a reliable periodic interval of 1 ms is highlighted. From this qualification of timers stems the requirements for the soft real-timer timer. The areas in which improvement is sought are stated. The design and implementation of a soft real-time timer that meets these requirements is presented and its performance at various frequencies is quantified. A comparison is given between the timer and the existing <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as well as comparison between its implementation under both Windows and Linux. Additionally, the viability of the proposed timer compared to a proven hard real-time timer is presented. Finally it is recognised that a timer would not be useful if it was not effective in a practical environment. Consequently, the timer’s performance under the same load that it would experience in a practical soft real-time environment is investigated as well. The dissertation concludes with a discussion on the compatibility of this timer with expected advances in future Central Processing Unit (CPU) technologies.

Even though the service provide by T/TCP is not exactly the same as TCP, its behavior may be acceptable for some applications. Therefore, we define a weaker specification that captures this behavior of T/TCP while maintaining the other correctness properties of our initial specification. We then verify that T/TCP satisfies this weaker specification. Ou...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} of time intervals is fundamental for sensorimotor and cognitive functions. Perceptual and motor timing are often performed concurrently (e. g., playing a musical instrument). Although {{previous studies have}} shown the influence of body movements on time perception, how we perceive self-produced time intervals has remained unclear. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested}} that the <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are distinct for the sub- and suprasecond ranges. Here, we compared perceptual performances for self-produced and passively presented time intervals in random contexts (i. e., multiple target intervals presented in a session) across the sub- and suprasecond ranges (Experiment 1) and within the sub- (Experiment 2) and suprasecond (Experiment 3) ranges, and in a constant context (i. e., a single target interval presented in a session) in the sub- and suprasecond ranges (Experiment 4). We show that self-produced time intervals were perceived as shorter and more variable across the sub- and suprasecond ranges and within the suprasecond range but not within the subsecond range in a random context. In a constant context, the self-produced time intervals were perceived as more variable in the suprasecond range but not in the subsecond range. The impairing effects indicate that motor timing interferes with perceptual timing. The dependence of impairment on temporal contexts suggests multiple <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the subsecond and suprasecond ranges. In addition, violation of the scalar property (i. e., a constant variability to target interval ratio) was observed between the sub- and suprasecond ranges. The violation was clearer for motor timing than for perceptual timing. This suggests that the multiple <b>timing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the sub- and suprasecond ranges overlap more for perception than for motor. Moreover, the central tendency effect (i. e., where shorter base intervals are overestimated and longer base intervals are underestimated) disappeared with subsecond motor timing within the subsecond range, suggesting multiple subsecond timing system for perception and motor...|$|R
