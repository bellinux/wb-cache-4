5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities.

5|$|In the Early Medieval era most {{evidence}} of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and the celebration of the Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, seal hunting. Literary life revolved around <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part of the mainstream of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood, like that excavated at Whithorn, the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.|$|E
25|$|Spiritual {{practices}} {{may include}} meditation, mindfulness, prayer, <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> sacred texts, ethical development, {{and the use}} of psychoactive substances (entheogens).

25|$|Human complexities, like {{reason and}} cognition, can produce {{well-being}} or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will.

25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists {{put us in}} touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes we meet not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> the realities to which their symbols pointed. There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E
25|$|Disinterested benevolence was {{the basis}} for piety, {{according}} to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires union with Christ through faith and embraces the way of the cross, which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation. For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and a preoccupation with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the status of their own souls because their love for God and <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> his glory made assurance of one's salvation virtually an afterthought.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the Hudson River School, {{prominent}} in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of Thomas Cole, the school's generally acknowledged founder, has {{much in common with}} the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as Albert Bierstadt, created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art {{can be found in the}} works of the Group of Seven, {{prominent in}} the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Entirely {{different}} in origin {{is the first}} part of the second section, drawn undoubtedly from an old tannaitic source. Four sentences of this section are cited in the Talmud as being taken from a Baraita (B. B. 90b; Sanh. 76b; Shab. 88b), and one in the name of Abba Arika (Sanh. l.c.), who often quoted old sentences and maxims (Er. 54a). The composition shows that this section is not taken from the Talmud, for the division into 12 good and 12 bad classes of men is not found in the latter. The other half of this section, however, is probably a later interpolation, belonging properly to the third section. For this section begins with a saying of Ben Azzai concerning four things <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> which would keep men from sin: hence the four classes of four things each that are enumerated in the second section.|$|E
25|$|The {{minutes of}} the old lodge at York, which later called itself the Grand Lodge of All England, give a glimpse of masonry outside the Grand Lodges of the period. The minutes are erratic, with spaces of some years between some entries. It is often {{impossible}} to tell if the minutes are lost, were never taken, or the lodge did not meet at all. They do, however, contain {{the full text of}} a speech by the antiquary Francis Drake in 1726, in which he discusses <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> geometry, and the instructive lectures which ought to be occurring in lodges. He used the York legend to claim precedence of his own lodge over all others in England, and being a more careful historian than the compilers of the Old Charges, Edwin the son of Athelstan became Edwin of Northumbria, adding three centuries to his lodge's pedigree. Later minutes show the lodge adding ritual, and developing a five degree system from a single ceremony where a candidate was admitted and made a Fellow Craft in one evening. The York account of the split between the Premier Grand Lodge of England and the Lodge of Antiquity provides a balance to the charged prose of William Preston. The minutes cease for the final time in 1792.|$|E

25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E

500|$|Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic {{landscape}} painter, {{generally considered}} the most important German artist of his generation. He {{is best known for}} his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs [...] "the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension".|$|E

60|$|He {{turned from}} the cat's parade, on which the shades of evening were descending, to <b>the</b> less romantic <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> his empty fire-grate.|$|R
500|$|The {{visualisation}} and {{portrayal of}} landscape {{in an entirely}} new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity, a reunion with the spiritual self through <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject. Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the Rückenfigur—a person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself {{in the position of}} the Rückenfigur, by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature, understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling—die romantische Stimmungslandschaft. His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests, and mountain scenes. [...] He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism.|$|E
500|$|As a symbol, an urn cannot {{completely}} represent poetry, {{but it does}} {{serve as}} one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity. The nightingale of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns. In contrast, being a piece of art, the urn requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own. This allows the urn to interact with humanity, to put forth a narrative, and allows for the imagination to operate. The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions, and {{the silence of the}} urn reinforces the imagination's ability to operate. This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself. In this meditation, the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art. The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar, and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures {{in a manner similar to}} [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". The figures on the urn within [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] lack identities, but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story, he would know their names. The second section of the poem, describing the piper and the lovers, meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters, which falls under the term [...] "Truth". The three figures would represent how Love, Beauty, and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience. The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Similarly, the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers.|$|E
