40|$|Tis article {{addresses}} the diﬀerent functions of anesthesia reservoir bag in a <b>breathing</b> <b>system.</b> A {{main purpose of}} the contribution was to explain complex interaction between the reservoir bag and fresh gas ﬂow during mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia reservoir bag is a collapsible gas container which is {{an essential component of}} most <b>breathing</b> <b>systems.</b> The anesthesia reservoir bag permits manual ventilation and acts as a visual or tactile indicator of spontaneous ventilation. The bag was excluded from traditional <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> when the ventilator was in use. Discrepancies between the set and actual tidal volume can occur. However, on some anesthesia workstation systems, such as the Dräger Primus, the reservoir bag {{is an integral part of}} the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> during mechanical ventilation, where it serves as a reservoir for oxygen and anaesthetic gases. In mechanically ventilated patients, gases enter the bag from the fresh gas ﬂow during inspiration, when the decoupling valve closes. The safe administration of general anesthesia requires understanding of the technological advances in highly sophisticated anesthetic equipment. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{working group}} from the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) and the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI) worked out the following recommendations for infection prevention during anaesthesia by using <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> filters (BSF). The BSF shall be changed after each patient. The filter retention efficiency for airborne particles is recommended to be > 99 % (II). The retention performance of BSF for liquids is recommended to be at pressures of at least 60 hPa (= 60 mbar) or 20 hPa above the selected maximum ventilation pressure in the anaesthetic <b>system.</b> The anaesthesia <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> {{may be used for}} a period of up to 7 days provided that the functional requirements of the system remain unchanged and the manufacturer states this in the instructions for use. The <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> and the manual ventilation bag are changed immediately after the respective anaesthesia if the following situation has occurred or it is suspected to have occurred: Notifiable infectious disease involving the risk of transmission via the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> and the manual bag, e. g. tuberculosis, acute viral hepatitis, measles, influenza virus, infection and/or colonisation with a multi-resistant pathogen or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. In case of visible contamination e. g. by blood or in case of defect, it is required that the BSF and also the anaesthesia <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> is changed and the breathing gas conducting parts of the anaesthesia ventilator are hygienically reprocessed. Observing of the appropriate hand disinfection is very important. All surfaces of the anaesthesia equipment exposed to hand contact must be disinfected after each case...|$|R

40|$|A {{regulator}} {{is described}} {{for the maintenance}} of a constant pressure difference above airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation in a cuffed tracheal tube. It comprises a tubular threshold valve which is powered by the anaesthetic gas supply source to a <b>breathing</b> <b>system.</b> The valve is interposed between the anaesthetic gas supply machine and the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> creating a pressure differential. The upstream pressure is transmitted to the pilot tube supplying the cuff of a tracheal tube via an upstream connection. The valve is suitable only for <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> that require a constant gas supply. The regulator was evaluated during anaesthesia, using a modified Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo jet ventilation tube to obtain simultaneous pressure measurements within the cuff and the lumen of the tracheal tube. A greater pressure was demonstrated in the cuff than in the airway and the two traces were approximately parallel throughout the respiratory cycle. The device should prevent excessive cuff inflation pressure and solves the problem of forgetting to let the cuff down before extubation. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Liquid in {{the form}} of sputum and {{condensation}} may be forced through a <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> filter if sufficient pressure is applied to the filter layer, with the potential for cross-infection. Twenty-three different <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> filters (12 adult, 11 paediatric) were assessed to determine the pressure causing liquid penetration. Five samples of each were tested by connecting the ventilator end of a <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> filter to a water-filled U-tube and reservoir. The reservoir was positioned so that the water surface was level with the filter layer and raised until liquid appeared through the filter layer on the patient side and the water-column height recorded. There were substantial differences in performance between models. Liquid penetration occurred at lower pressures for adult electrostatic than adult pleated filters: median [IQR] 1. 18 [1. 08 – 1. 32] and 8. 04 [4. 27 – 12. 80] kPa, respectively, p < 0. 0001.

40|$|Although {{constant}} positive airway pressure {{therapy is}} currently the most effective form of non-invasive treatment to relieve obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, it has relatively low treatment compliance due to pressure related side effects. Existing commercial continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices rely on the combined airflow characteristics of both the air delivery unit and nasal mask vent to regulate treatment pressure. Fluctuation in mask pressure occurs however, due to patient breathing, presenting an opportunity to develop an alternative breathing therapy device capable of achieving dynamic control of mask pressure. Within this research, a computer model of a proposed patient breathing therapy device, based on characteristics of a prototype system, is developed to determine the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> air delivery requirements whilst operating under a simulated patient breathing load. This model initially utilises an idealised, zero order, air delivery unit behaviour, since this system element {{is yet to be}} built. A review of different types of air compressors is undertaken and the diaphragm type compressor selected as being best suited for practical implementation within the air delivery unit of the <b>breathing</b> <b>system,</b> based on constraints of air quality, available machining resource and materials. Thermodynamic design of the compressor is undertaken to determine physical dimensions and a range of actuation methods are reviewed, based on force and speed requirements. A speed controlled 3 phase AC induction motor is selected to actuate the compressor. The diaphragm compressor is built and tested under both steady state and dynamic conditions and proven capable of meeting the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> air supply for both air pressure and flow requirements. The air delivery unit within the model simulation, previously based on an idealised, zero order element, is characterised with the same dynamic behaviour as the prototype unit built, established during testing, and shown by simulation to meet the <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> requirements under dynamic patient breathing load. Implementation of the air delivery unit within the completed prototype <b>breathing</b> <b>system</b> shows the mask pressure to fluctuate outside the desire pressure tolerance range; however, to remedy this situation, the compressor requires the development of an appropriate control scheme which {{is beyond the scope of}} this work...|$|R

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that anaesthetic <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> are poorly designed, and {{would benefit from}} engineering modeling to improve function. The use of <b>breathing</b> <b>systems</b> in different environments is described. Bath fp, a software package, developed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering for mathematically modelling hydraulic <b>systems</b> such as <b>breathing</b> <b>systems,</b> is introduced. Bath fp was used to model the behaviour of anaesthetic circle systems at high, medium, low and minimum fresh gas flows (FGFs). Using 50 % nitrous oxide in oxygen ('entonox') as a gas model for all such volatile anaesthetic agents, the behaviour of the system was observed in terms of gas concentrations, volumetric flow-rates and airway pressures. Anaesthetic circle systems studied included standard adult and paediatric systems, and a coaxial system. In the standard systems, different tubing lengths and diameters were modelled, and for the coaxial system, different diameter ratios of outer and inner tubes were modelled. Gas concentration changes {{at different points in}} the system were used to clarify system function at different FGFs. Management of exhaled carbon dioxide was examined, including changing absorber volume. A venturi was modelled and added to a valveless coaxial circle system, to see how the venturi changed system function, and under what conditions it might fail. Clinical data were collected to validate modelling results. Nineteen adult volunteers were recruited to a trial, in which entonox was breathed through standard and coaxial systems for short periods, at different FGFs, with high flow air-breathing periods in between. Data on gas concentrations were collected from three points in each system. Results were analysed, and function was compared between different systems, and between systems and modelling results. The simulation model clarified circle system function, and showed that function depended more on FGF than on geometry. The clinical data supported the use of simulation to predict the behaviour of <b>breathing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
