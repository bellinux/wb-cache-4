25|$|This {{marked the}} first time the United States had {{successfully}} attacked the Comanches {{in the heart of the}} Comancheria, and showed that the Staked Plains were no longer a safe haven. Further, this battle emphasized if the army wished to force the wild Comanches onto reservations, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was destroy their villages and leave them unable to survive off reservation. Mackenzie's tactics were such a success that Sherman empowered him to use them further during the Red River War of 1874. His attack on the village at Palo Duro Canyon, and his destruction of the Comanche horse herd at Tule Canyon, both in 1874, mirrored this battle in their entirety.|$|E

[...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon {{was not to be}} informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|E

In addition to receiving presentations {{from both sides}} with new arguments and evidence, Slaton visited the crime scene and reviewed over 10,000 pages of documents. This included various letters, including one written by Judge Roan shortly before he died asking Slaton to correct his mistake. Slaton also received more than 1,000 death threats. During the hearing, former Governor Joseph Brown warned Slaton, [...] "In all frankness, if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts." [...] According to Tom Watson's biographer, C. Vann Woodward, [...] "While the hearings of the petition to commute were in progress Watson sent a friend to the governor with the promise that if Slaton allowed Frank to hang, Watson would be his 'friend', which would result in his 'becoming United States senator and the master of Georgia politics for twenty years to come.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

In And Be a Villain (chapter 17), he issues a dinner invitation and regrets doing so on short notice: [...] "There will not be time to chambrer a claret properly, but we can have the chill off." [...] Continuing the invitation, Wolfe says of a certain brandy, [...] "I hope this won't shock you, but <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is to sip it with bites of Fritz's apple pie." ...|$|E
