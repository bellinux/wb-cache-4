5|$|This {{provides}} a definition for <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia, {{which is the}} rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of choice, at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E

In other words, the joint distribution of A + B and the joint distribution of AB depend only on the marginal distributions of A and B.|$|R
30|$|Due {{to lack of}} data on prices, we proxy {{production}} risk by <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> {{production function}} rather than <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profit function as Koundouri et al.

The largest part of {{analysis}} is focused on extremes of dependent normal values.

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Big Bang lattice model, {{states that}} the {{universe}} at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of fermions, which is smeared over the fundamental domain so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|But the Admiral {{was never}} {{assigned}} another command. Concluding {{that he was}} being held up as a scapegoat, and feeling bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the Navy's greatest accomplishment, Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945, and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> Bessel {{functions}} and Bessel-trigonometric functions play a basic role in many practical problems and numerical analysis. This paper presents a complete analysis for these <b>moments</b> based on <b>the</b> recursive relations of Bessel functions. To evaluate <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> Bessel functions numerically, a fast and efficient scheme is also proposed to approximate the integral of Bessel {{function of the}} first kind and <b>of</b> zero order. <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> Bessel-trigonometric functions are proved to be expressed in a closed form. In the numerical results, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed analysis for <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> Bessel functions is validated first and then by comparing the existing methods, a better scheme for <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> Bessel functions is presented.

5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|The 21 grams {{experiment}} {{refers to}} a scientific study published in 1907 by Duncan MacDougall, a physician from Haverhill, Massachusetts. MacDougall hypothesized that souls have physical weight, and attempted to measure the mass lost by a human when the soul departed the body. MacDougall attempted to measure the mass change of six patients at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> death. One of the six subjects lost three-fourths of an ounce (21.3 grams).|$|E
40|$|We give a {{conjecture}} for <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dedekind zeta {{function of}} a Galois extension via the hybrid product method. <b>The</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product of primes are evaluated using the Montgomery-Vaughan mean value theorem whilst for <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product over zeros we give a heuristic argument involving random matrix theory. The asymptotic for <b>the</b> first <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product over zeros is then proved for quadratic extensions. We are also able to reproduce our main conjecture in the quadratic case by using a modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> recipe.

5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> mystic illumination. He {{goes on to say}} that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{took office}} {{for his second}} presidential term on 1 July 1989, {{and in the course}} of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Reunification of Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the {{official}} festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the reunification of Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due to the sound of the bells marking midnight, and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> the sinking.

5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes.

From <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E
