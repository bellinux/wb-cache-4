5|$|A bourdon or knobbed {{staff is}} shown behind {{the arms of}} some priors and prioresses {{as a symbol of}} office {{analogous}} to the crosier. Arms of priors from the 15th century had a banner surrounding the shield, but today <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a rosary.|$|E
5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader {{as long as there}} were ravens at the Tower of London; although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E
5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all {{the light from}} objects being observed, instead gathering light from a slit or small aperture. Therefore, different observations may sample {{different parts of the}} nebula.|$|E

5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{structured}} biopolymers such as proteins, one {{can define}} topology of a folded RNA molecule. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within a folded RNA, termed as circuit topology.|$|E

5|$|Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates {{are also}} {{released}} as previews and for testing before final releases. Although {{there is a}} rough schedule for each release, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> pushed back, if the code is not ready. The development team monitors {{the state of the}} code by running the large unit test suite during development, and using the BuildBot continuous integration system.|$|E
5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{not the case in}} other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is related to their gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E
5|$|Some moulds allow {{previously}} {{moulded parts}} to be reinserted {{to allow a}} new plastic layer to form around the first part. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> referred to as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and wheels.|$|E

5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> the case with herpes viruses.|$|E
5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.|$|E
5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E

5|$|Bayern is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> accounted for by Bayern not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting in the loss of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> known as 'free-board'.|$|E

5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> referred to as countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, Pesach has <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{used as an}} {{occasion}} for political or social commentary. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> the case when the departure of Soviet Jews was compared to {{the departure of the}} Jews from Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Reports from Time {{magazine}} {{indicate that}} members of the 055 Brigade <b>were</b> <b>often</b> deployed in smaller groups to help reinforce regular Afghan members of the Taliban. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> achieved via threats or intimidation designed to enforce discipline and a commitment to the mujahedin philosophy.|$|R
