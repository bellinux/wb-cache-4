5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by the news of <b>the</b> <b>annexation.</b> While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of}} the action, as <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, 1845, Texas President Jones {{called for}} a {{convention}} on July 4, 1845, to consider <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> and a constitution. On June 23, the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress's joint resolution of March 1, 1845, annexing Texas to the United States, and consented to the convention. On July 4, the Texas convention debated <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it. The convention remained in session through August 28, and adopted the Constitution of Texas on August 27, 1845. The citizens of Texas approved <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> ordinance and new constitution on October 13, 1845.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of <b>the</b> <b>annexation,</b> Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E

5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{controversy}} over the legality of <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Texas {{stems from the fact}} that Congress approved <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Texas as a state, rather than a territory, with simple majorities in each house, instead of annexing the land by Senate treaty, as was done with Native American lands. Tyler's extralegal joint resolution maneuver in 1844 exceeded strict constructionist precepts, but was passed by Congress in 1845 as part of a compromise bill. The success of the joint house Texas annexation set a precedent that would be applied to Hawaii's annexation in 1897.|$|E

50|$|In 1947, <b>the</b> {{large-scale}} <b>annexation</b> {{was rejected}} by the Allied High Commission, on the grounds that Germany already contained 14,000,000 refugees from <b>the</b> <b>annexations</b> in <b>the</b> east, and that the remaining territory could not handle more refugees.

5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming {{to the idea}} of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management.

While full city-county consolidation was voted down, the efforts of the 1930s set the stage for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 131 - 142) A {{comprehensive review}} of annexation literature is presented in this study. The review deals specifically with annexation uses, legislation, and effects which create a background for {{a case study of}} local annexation processes in Santa Rosa, California. Prior to this study, there was only a single group of studies which approached <b>the</b> topic of <b>annexation</b> at <b>the</b> local level. It has commonly been stated that more than ninety percent of <b>the</b> <b>annexations</b> to a city are proposed by developers for the purpose of immediate development-for-profit. This study refutes this statement since the findings show that approximately sixty percent of <b>the</b> <b>annexations</b> to Santa Rosa, during the period 1966 through 1975, were proposed by developers for profit. The remaining forty percent of <b>the</b> <b>annexations</b> were proposed for other reasons. Zoning, designations given to new annexations are also investigated to determine their conformance with the general plan. It is hypothesized that such newly assigned zoning will conform to the general plan. In the Santa Rosa case it is shown that, in exercising options at annexation, zoning conformed in three cases out of four. This rate of conformity was slightly increased over time through subsequent general plan amendments. Since 1974, state law has required that all zoning designations reflect general plan tenets...|$|R

5|$|Teuruarii IV {{left behind}} several notable descendents. In 1923, {{one of his}} sons, Rooteatauira a Teuruarii, was {{involved}} in a controversial embezzlement case that called into question the jurisdiction of French law over native inhabitants of its territories. Rooteatauira, along with his accomplice Tinorrua a Hurahtia, had embezzled various goods to the detriment of Sum-You, a Chinese merchant. In the case, Rooteatauira argued that he should be prosecuted by native law rather than French law and that <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> was illegal since it was done without the sanctioned of the King of Rurutu or the approval of the French Parliament. However, the French colonial court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> was valid and that he would be prosecuted by French law since the offense was committed against a non-native. Rooteatauira was sentenced to two years in prison and fined fifty francs. In 1934, Rooteatauira was appointed chief of Moerai and given an annual pension of seven hundred and twenty francs.|$|E

5|$|The 1938 Polish {{ultimatum}} to Lithuania was {{an ultimatum}} delivered to Lithuania by Poland on March 17, 1938. The Lithuanian government had steadfastly refused {{to have any}} diplomatic relations with Poland after 1920, protesting <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of the Vilnius Region by Poland. As pre-World War II tensions in Europe intensified, Poland perceived the need to secure its northern borders. Five days earlier, Poland, feeling supported by international recognition of <b>the</b> <b>annexation</b> of Austria by Nazi Germany, decided to deliver an ultimatum to Lithuania. The ultimatum demanded that the Lithuanian government unconditionally agree to establish diplomatic relations with Warsaw within 48 hours, and that the terms be finalized before March 31. The establishment of diplomatic relations would mean a de facto renunciation of Lithuanian claims to the region containing its historic capital, Vilnius (known in Polish as Wilno).|$|E
