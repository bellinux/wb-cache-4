5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{was listed}} in the Kennel Club's first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list is for those breeds which {{register}} less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, {{with a total of}} 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was also added, as there had been only 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this on the importation of foreign dog breeds, The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline on the ban on <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> introduced six years before. However, 2015 saw an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
25|$|The charity {{group has}} {{collaborated with the}} New Zealand Veterinary Association on a {{campaign}} against the <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> of dogs. The SPCA claimed <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> was an outdated and cosmetic practice which offered no benefits but causes unnecessary pain to the animal. The New Zealand Kennel Club purported there was no scientific evidence to support any of the SPCA's claims and said <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> should be up to owners' preference. No decision was ever passed into law.|$|E

5000|$|Many breeds {{of sheep}} have their <b>tails</b> <b>docked</b> {{to reduce the}} buildup of faeces which can {{encourage}} fly strike. [...] Also {{used for this purpose}} is mulesing. Docking also makes it easier to view a grown ewe's udders to detect potential problems.|$|R
25|$|Under the {{legislation}} <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> {{may only be}} used as a last resort. The law provides that farmers must first take measures to improve the pigs’ conditions and, only where these have failed to prevent tail biting, may they tail dock.|$|E
25|$|Many English {{fattening}} pigs {{are kept in}} barren conditions and are routinely tail docked. Since 2003 EU legislation has required pigs to be given environmental enrichment and has banned routine <b>tail</b> <b>docking.</b> However, 80% of UK pigs are tail docked.|$|E
25|$|Today, many {{countries}} ban cropping and docking because {{they consider the}} practices unnecessary, painful, cruel or mutilation. In Europe, the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. Some countries that ratified the convention made exceptions for <b>tail</b> <b>docking.</b>|$|E

25|$|In England and Wales, ear {{cropping}} is illegal, and no {{dog with}} cropped ears can {{take part in}} any Kennel Club event (including agility and other non-conformation events). <b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> is also illegal, {{except for a few}} working breeds; this exemption applies only when carried out by a registered veterinary surgeon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>docking</b> is done {{in modern}} times either for prophylactic, therapeutic, or {{cosmetic}} purposes. For dogs that work in the field, such as some hunting dogs and herding dogs, tails can collect burrs and foxtails, causing pain and infection and, due to the tail's wagging, {{may be subject to}} abrasion or other injury while moving through dense brush or thickets.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> {{was thought}} to prevent rabies, {{strengthen}} the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when ratting, fighting, and baiting. In early Georgian times in the United Kingdom a tax was levied upon working dogs with tails, so many types of dog were docked to avoid this tax. The tax was repealed in 1796 {{but that did not}} stop the practice from persisting.|$|E

50|$|Originally, most docking {{was done}} for {{practical}} purposes. For example, a draft horse used for hauling large loads might have had its <b>tail</b> <b>docked</b> {{to prevent it from}} becoming entangled in tow ropes, farm machinery, or harness; without docking, it could be dangerous to the horse, painful if the tail were tangled, and inconvenient to the owner to tie up the horse's tail for every use.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the breed's <b>tail</b> was {{typically}} <b>docked</b> to a length just sufficient {{to serve as}} a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose <b>tails</b> were <b>docked</b> on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with <b>docked</b> <b>tails,</b> but dogs kept as pets cannot.|$|R
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, <b>tail</b> <b>docking,</b> and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, ear cropping, <b>tail</b> <b>docking,</b> rodeo sports, {{and other}} acts are legal and {{sometimes}} condoned. Penalties for cruelty can be minimal, if pursued. Currently, 46 of the 50 states have enacted felony penalties for {{certain forms of}} animal abuse. However, in most jurisdictions, animal cruelty is most commonly charged as a misdemeanor offense. In one recent California case, a felony conviction for animal cruelty could theoretically net a 25-year to life sentence due to their three-strikes law, which increases sentences based on prior felony convictions.|$|E
500|$|Harry Parsons, {{founder of}} the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, has stated that, [...] "To sustain a breed...you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year". The Kennel Club has blamed {{the decline of the}} breed on the {{availability}} of designer dogs and newer breeds such as the Shih Tzu, and the banning of <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> which has reduced their ability as working dogs. Paul Keevil, formerly of the Kennel Club's vulnerable breeds committee explains: [...] "Traditionally, soon after Sealyhams were born, their tails were docked by half their length, because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes, meaning that they required short, strong tails for the owner to be able to pull them out." [...] As of 2010, the breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by the American Kennel Club.|$|E

But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named Huddersfield Ben, owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.|$|R

The common height at the withers is between , while a male dog of this breed should weigh more than , and a female [...] [...] The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking. Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually curly. Due to the advent of <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> in dogs, the bob tail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban docking, some breeders are again attempting to select dogs with the genes for natural bob tails.|$|E

50|$|Braiding the <b>dock</b> of the <b>tail</b> in a French braid {{with the}} skirt left loose is {{commonly}} seen in hunter competition and hunt seat equitation. In polo, draft horse showing and on Lipizzan horses that perform the capriole, the entire <b>tail,</b> <b>dock</b> and skirt, is generally braided and the braid is folded or rolled into a knot, {{with or without}} added ribbons and other decorative elements. In inclement weather, many other show disciplines will allow competitors {{to put up the}} skirt of the tail into a similar type of stylized knot known as a mud tail.|$|R

2500|$|Doberman Pinschers {{often have}} their ears cropped, {{as do many}} other breeds, a {{procedure}} that is functionally related to breed type for both the traditional guard duty and effective sound localization.

2500|$|Other common {{elective}} {{surgical procedures}} in the United States are declawing in cats (onychectomy), ear-cropping in dogs, <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> in dogs, horses, and dairy cattle, and Livestock dehorning in cattle, sheep, and goats. [...] These procedures have been controversial and recently debated among breeders, veterinary organizations, and animal welfare scientists. The controversy is different for each procedure, but issues arise based on reasons to perform the procedure, differing opinions on techniques and methods, perceived long-term benefits in individual animals, {{and the development of}} alternatives. Declawing, for example, consists of removal of the distal phalanges using either a scalpel, scissors or laser. It is typically performed to prevent property damage in house cats, but may also be performed in purebred dogs to meet certain show requirements. Some procedures are illegal in some countries (in the UK, declawing is illegal and <b>tail</b> <b>docking</b> is only allowed in working dogs) and face ethical challenges in others.|$|E
50|$|Once the crosses began, Hays {{selected}} for the traits he wanted, and any offspring that {{did not make the}} cut {{in one way or another}} would have their <b>tails</b> <b>docked</b> and were shipped off to a processing plant. Once all desired traits were achieved in the offspring, the breed was closed off to mating with any outside breeds. By the time the breed achieved pedigree status in 1975, it had achieved all of the traits Hays had hoped it would. These traits included, high growth rate, sturdy build, good carcass quality, easy calving and excellent milk production.|$|R
50|$|Some Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{are born}} with their tail {{naturally}} short or missing. Others may have their <b>tails</b> <b>docked</b> between 2-5 days old due to historical tradition or {{as a measure of}} conformation to the Breed Standard. Artificial docking was born of necessity given the Pembroke's function as a herding dog in the United Kingdom. According to Tax Law, any companion canine was considered a luxury and pet/companion owners were levied a tax. Dog owners, however, who kept dogs for working purposes such as herding were exempt from the tax. In order to claim the exemption, owners had to ensure the dogs sported <b>docked</b> or bobbed <b>tails.</b> The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states <b>tails</b> should be <b>docked</b> no longer than 2 in. In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal.|$|R
