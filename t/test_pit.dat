50|$|In {{order to}} create a chronological framework, as well as measure the depth of deposit in the site, several <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> were dug around the north-south and east-west axes. There were thirty-three <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> in total, each one about one-meter square. The <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> gave archeologists an {{understanding}} of Shanga’s development and patterns of occupation. Results from the <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> indicate that there was a concentration of occupation towards the center of the site in between two dune ranges. It is believed that the center of occupation was determined by the availability of water resources. The community that occupied Shanga in the past settled in the areas that showed promising water supply.|$|R
50|$|A {{phase of}} {{evaluation}} is considered important {{in assessing the}} significance of a possible cultural heritage site. This can comprise a desk-based study, interviews with informants in the community, a wide-area survey, or trial trenching. In North America, survey normally includes either walking ploughed fields in 5-10-metre transects or digging shovel <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> at the same intervals. The soil from the <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> is sifted through 6 mm mesh to look for artifacts. If artifacts are found, {{the next stage of}} investigation is usually digging and sifting a spaced grid of <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> (1 m by 1 m trenches) to determine how large or significant the site is.|$|R

2500|$|In 1899, {{when the}} area {{was part of the}} Ottoman Empire, Max von Oppenheim, a German diplomat {{travelled}} through northern Mesopotamia on behalf of Deutsche Bank, working on establishing a route for the Bagdad Railway. On 19 November, he discovered Tell Halaf, following up on tales told to him by local villagers of stone idols buried beneath the sand. Within three days, several significant pieces of statuary were uncovered, including the so-called [...] "Sitting Goddess".

2500|$|On May 16, 1937 {{bones were}} found in a <b>test</b> <b>pit</b> about 110 feet from the second ossuary. [...] The bones were not fully exposed until September 9.

[...] Part of a dog skeleton was found in the burial. [...] There is no description of these bones, making them seem unimportant. [...] Judge Graham, the archaeologist working there at the time, thought this grave was not significant and did not do much analysis on the skeletons found inside it.|$|E
2500|$|On one {{of several}} trips he made while {{stationed}} at Cairo, in 1899 Oppenheim travelled via Aleppo to Damascus and northern Mesopotamia on behalf of Deutsche Bank, working on establishing a route for the Bagdad Railway.

Deutsche Bank was not satisfied with his work on the railway and he was subsequently dismissed as an advisor.

2500|$|In 1991, Gwen Resources Limited {{performed}} a detailed program of diamond drilling, geological mapping, trenching and surveying at Beanland. After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton bulk sample was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old assay results on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic track drill and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high erratic values of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the bulk sample was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the <b>test</b> <b>pit</b> had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|E

50|$|Arundel Cove Archaeological Site is {{an archaeological}} site near Baltimore in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

The site was discovered during routine shovel <b>test</b> <b>pitting</b> of the U.S. Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay in 1981. The <b>test</b> <b>pits</b> revealed that the site is small in size, extending only 20 feet north-south by 15 feet east-west.

It contains a prehistoric period storage pits, with evidence of the use of galium and wild black cherry.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of trial {{excavation}} in professional archaeology both commonly associated with development-led excavation: the <b>test</b> <b>pit</b> or trench and the watching brief. The purpose of trial excavations {{is to determine the}} extent and characteristics of archaeological potential in a given area before extensive excavation work is undertaken. This is usually conducted in development-led excavations as part of Project management planning. the main difference between Trial trenching and watching briefs is that trial trenches are actively dug for the purpose of revealing archaeological potential whereas watching briefs are cursory examination of trenches where the primary function of the trench is something other than archaeology, for example a trench cut for a gas pipe in a road. In the USA, a method of evaluation called a Shovel <b>test</b> <b>pit</b> is used which is a specified half meter square line of trial trenches dug by hand.|$|E

40|$|In June 2004 Channel 4 's Time Team {{broadcast}} {{nine days}} of live archaeological investigations {{on more than}} 1, 300 sites across the United Kingdom. This broke a number of records, including the number of siles investigated {{and the number of}} people involved, and as such was called 'Big Dig'. One of the guiding principles of Big Dig was that it should allow members of the general public the chance to excavate in their 'own' patch - for most this mean! digging in their gardens, while others had the chance to dig in their local park or school grounds. It is therefore not surprising to nOle that most of the sites investigated were with in settlements which were in existence in the Middle Ages, and many of them were medieval rural settlements.
