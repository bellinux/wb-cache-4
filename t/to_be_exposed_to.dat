5|$|Post-battle {{analysis}} suggests only 11 of the Luftwaffe's 34 air combat Gruppen made attacks {{on time and}} with surprise. The operation failed to achieve air superiority, even temporarily, while the German ground forces continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Allied air attack. Bodenplatte was the last large-scale strategic offensive operation mounted by the Luftwaffe during the war.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or dry up completely.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius characterizes Urbanus {{as a man}} {{who enjoyed}} some variety in his punishments. One day, shortly after Easter 307, he ordered the virgin Theodosia from Tyre (Ṣūr, Lebanon) thrown to the sea for conversing with Christians {{attending}} trial and refusing sacrifice; the Christians in court, meanwhile, he sent to Phaeno. On a single day, November 2, 307, Urbanus sentenced a man named Domninus to be burned alive, three youths to fight as gladiators, and a priest <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a beast. On the same day, he ordered some young men to be castrated, sent three virgins to brothels, and imprisoned a number of others, including Pamphilus of Caesarea, a priest, scholar, and defender of the theologian Origen. Soon after, and for unknown reasons, Urbanus was stripped of his rank, imprisoned, tried, and executed, all in one day of expedited proceedings. His replacement, Firmilianus, was a veteran soldier and one of Maximinus's trusted confidants.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies on}} firm s {{exchange}} risk exposure overlooked {{not only the}} importance of small and medium sized firms (hereafter SMEs) but also the issues on firm location, exchange rate (hereafter ex-rate) type, and ex-rate changes size. Using the model of Jorion (1990) for Korean SMEs from 2007 to 2010, this paper suggests the primary results as the followings: (1) Korean SMEs located near the capital, Seoul, <b>are</b> less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> ex-rate changes than those located in other regions, (2) Korean SMEs <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a bilateral ex-rate of KRW against USD than a constructed trade-weighted ex-rate index, (3) Korean SMEs <b>are</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> ex-rate changes from September 2008 to May 2009, when the changes are sizable...|$|R

5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne {{arranges}} for Eve's past {{relationship with}} Julian <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the Russell {{family and the}} rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on Passions. Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with Fox Crane to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician Miles Davis. During the show's 2005 summertime extravaganza, Whitney has sex with Chad {{in the middle of a}} tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the Vendetta plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on Alistair Crane luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by tabloid editor JT Cornell and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.|$|E

On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition.

25|$|The worms of S. haematobium {{migrate to}} the veins around the bladder and ureters. This can lead to blood in the urine 10 to 12 weeks after infection. Over time, {{fibrosis}} can lead to obstruction of the urinary tract, hydronephrosis and kidney failure. Bladder cancer diagnosis and mortality are generally elevated in affected areas, and efforts to control schistosomiasis in Egypt have led to decreases in the bladder cancer rate. The risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers, perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> carcinogens from smoking.|$|E
