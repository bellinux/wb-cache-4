40|$|The verb to {{communicate}} {{has a lot}} of synonyms: speaking, divulging, passing on, publishing, conveying, explaining, informing, exchanging, corresponding To communicate is more than just being in {{contact with the outside world}} a simple handshake has the same effect. It is more about expecting a result. And so it is in development, where there are competing messages and demands for attention from various centres of power. Amid all the noise, the top priority has to be about communication leading to understanding and action. Illustration: H. Larkins Designing a newspaper, a folder, a <b>technical</b> <b>leaflet</b> or an extension chart, submitting a funding proposal, or sending a summary or a full report to decision makers, are all acts of communication grouped together as the paper media. They are the preferred and somewhat inflexible methods of communication for researchers, extension workers, groups and associations, business leaders, NGOs and farmers. Effective communication involves a choice of writing style and presentation which varies according to the intended audience, the message to be communicated, and the medium to be used. These three facets are always interlinked, but, at the outset, it is the choice of audience which determines how it should be addressed. After all, you do not address scientists the same way as you address a group of farmers, students or children. When a researcher is communicating his findings to other researchers, he uses a structure and a style which bear nothing in common with the style used to disseminate the same findings, or a press release, or a training brochure, about them. The rules used in the different types of documents change, but the underlying logic stays the same: it is about helping the chosen audience to best understand the message. And so the same basic text can be used in variety of ways. A scientific article can be used, for example, as the basis for writing a <b>technical</b> <b>leaflet.</b> This assumes, of course, that the original text and the message to be passed on are suitable for re-packaging. It would be wrong, for example, to tell a group of farmers about a series of experiments conducted on a water pump if the real message to be communicated is about how the pump works. A range of materials can be used for written communication, each one of them with a distinct structure that is derived from the content, use and target group. A network newsletter, for example, serves as a forum for exchange which brings together members or subscribers around a shared activity. Technical leaflets, on the other hand, aim at passing on a piece of knowledge or instructions on using a technique, and express information in clear language, with supporting illustrations and simple references. And, as the saying goes, a picture speaks a thousand words, which is why extension materials and posters often use images as an attractive and easy way of communicating information to people with reading difficulties. Another medium with a specific use is a series of booklets, a collection of small documents dealing with the same subject from different perspectives. A series aims at encourage reading habits, and familiarity (through using the same typefaces, presentation, colours and layout of texts). So the choice of medium to be used is defined by the situation of the reader, who has to be able to understand the message immediately. A learning strategy The selection of the target group, the choice of the message, the multiple uses of the same basic information, letting the message define the medium, style and form: all these are skills that can be learned, alongside the ground rules of ethics in communication skills. There are specialised centres and institutes, such as ISSIC in Senegal (see box), which provide training courses in communication. There are other bodies too, whose role is to run professional workshops and short courses in communication techniques and the skills of the written media. No matter how skilled you may become, every writer well knows the state of total fear of writing, of staring at an empty page hoping it will fill itself with words. The condition is called writer s block and afflicts anyone who writes for a living but cannot get started. Nowadays therapy is available in the form of writing workshops which dispense writing exercises. They are designed, like gymnastic exercises, to clear your thinking, and give you the courage to get going. It should be painless The ABC of Book Publishing. A Training manual for NGOs in Africa.

The number of accessions is now over 2 500, mostly of apples, pears and plums, {{all of which}} are planted in the open on dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks. One third of the material was recovered from old, often endangered collections in horticultural schools and to a minor extent from collections abroad, and two thirds from old orchards on faims and in gardens. A preference was given to material originated in Belgium either as landraces or as cultivars produced by recognized breeders from the part two centuries. The initial aim, which is still a priority, was to evaluate a broad range of old cultivars for useful characters, with an emphasis on disease resistance. As the collection expanded, a conservation objective also developed. From 1985 on, the Station started to reintroduce in the nursery trade and to recommend for home-growing the better cultivars emerging from the evaluation. Fifteen cultivars were released up to now, among which ten apples, four plums and one peach cv. Corresponding <b>technical</b> <b>leaflets</b> were also edited.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{publications}} and publishing practices of Alexander Dalrymple (1737 - 1808). Dalrymple was cumulatively a private publisher of nautical charts and plans (from 1767), the "examiner of ships' journals" and chart publisher for the East India Company (from 1779), and Hydrographer to the Admiralty (from 1795). The core of the study is a catalogue of the known publications of Alexander Dalrymple, defining and establishing his oeuvre. The catalogue is in two parts, Catalogue A for the letterpress publications, numbering 257, and Catalogue B for the engraved charts, plans of ports, views of land, and other Illustrations, numbering 1116. The entries in each part of the catalogue are arranged chronologically by date of publication, with full bibliographical and technical descriptions, and notes of attribution, dating and inter-relationships. The introduction gives a short account of Dalrymple's life, focussing on his publishing activity, and introducing his geographical and political pamphlet publishing. Four phases of activity in his nautical publication are identified: the decision to publish charts and memoirs from his own voyages in the Eastern Archipelago (1769 - 1772); the private publication of charts and plans with grants or subscriptions from the East India Company (1772 - 1779); the annual series of charts, plans, views and memoirs issued from 1779 onwards for the East India Company; and the organisation and output of the Admiralty Hydrographic Office which he ran in parallel with his East India Company work after 1795. This is supplemented by a discussion of the continuing use made of Dalrymple's charts after his death in 1808. An investigation of Dalrymple's engraving and publishing practices follows, with a brief survey of his <b>technical</b> <b>leaflets</b> and manuals on nautical surveying and chronometer use, and an account of Oriental Repertory, his chief non-nautical publication. The study emphasises the close personal control Dalrymple exercised over his publications, and the consequent problems in the Admiralty and East India Company in developing arrangements to continue publishing charts after his death...|$|R

Yet the recipes are not standardized and the products vary in quality and concentration of the active ingredients. bioRe®, together with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), engages in research activities to address this challenge and constantly improve pest management strategies in organic farming. The research activities are carried out as a combination of on-station trials and participatory on-farm trials with the farmers. During the cotton cropping season 2013 - 14 one on-station and two on-farm trials were conducted {{with the objective of}} comparing different spraying intervals of the most commonly used self-made organic pest control products in order to identify an optimum level of crop protection. The study focused on the effect of the spraying intervals on the most important sucking pests (Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), Cotton jassid (Amrasca biguttula biguttula), Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), Cotton mealy bug (Phenacoccus solenopsis) and Thrips (Thripidae)). Besides sucking pest incidences, data on plant stress symptoms and yield formation as well as economic parameters were also collected. Additionally, on-station trials were established to investigate different measures of early stage crop protection and to evaluate specific effects of three self-made products (Garlic-Onion-Chilli extract, Top Ten and Neem seed extract) against certain sucking pests. The products were prepared according to recipes standardized by bioRe® after careful research and hands-on experience of its associated scientists and extension workers. This knowledge was reproduced in pictorial <b>technical</b> <b>leaflets</b> which are easy-to-understand for the local farmers. A total of 11 leaflets - on seed treatments (2), early stage protection measures (1), pest control sprays (6), effective spraying technique (1) and growth promoter (1) were designed in both English and Hindi and will be used for dissemination activities. On-station results were inconclusive due to a low pest pressure in this year’s cotton season, as well as the small size of on-station trial plots. Results of on-farm trials revealed that a suitable strategy for in-field pest monitoring is needed for farmers to determine how often and at what time point pest control interventions are indicated. Further research is needed to understand the specific effects of home-made products on the different insect species. Optimized dosage and application techniques have to be worked out along with other options for integrated pest control (e. g. bird perches, border crops, soil enhancement practices) which could reduce the frequency of time-consuming spraying practices. These activities would best be conducted in on-farm rather than on–station trials...|$|R

40|$|PRECONS (Programme {{regional}} de reboisement et de conservation des sols au Sahel - The Regional Programme for Reforestation and Soil Conservation in the Sahel) {{is responsible}} for strengthening regional cooperation within the Sahel for soil and water conservation. The work, which is carried out {{under the auspices of}} the Permanent International Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) has been continuing for five years and is based on experience gained in Cape Verde. The first phase of the programme was launched when it was felt that there was a suitable level of technical competence available within the services responsible. At the same time public awareness and regional cooperation were such that the programme had a good chance of success. A tree-planting scheme was carried out on 4, 700 hectares on three islands of Cape Verde. The first phase, which used anti-soil erosion techniques already proven to be effective in the islands, provided the practical experience for a second phase. This was aimed at transferring soil and water conservation techniques to other countries in the Sahel region. The second phase included the training of 350 officers at a number of courses organized in Cape Verde and in all other CILSS member countries (except Niger), and the production of training and information publications as well as a manual and thirty <b>technical</b> <b>leaflets.</b> Research shows that a poor level of commitment and participation by rural people can be explained only in part by cultural attitudes and a low level of literacy. The way in which intervention policies are handled, the nature of the relationship between people and institutions, and the appropriateness or otherwise of teaching methods, also have a bearing. It was with this in mind that PRECONS designed its information materials (posters, booklets etc.) and its manual on rural development. The manual, which was published in 1994, is designed for development workers and provides a practical look at all the situations that they may have to cover, including: planning a programme of intervention preparations for carrying out the programme organizing work sessions promoting complementary activities preparing an evaluation at the end of the programme, and establishing follow-up procedures once the programme is complete. The manual does not pretend to be a definitive work on the subject. It attempts to make a contribution to education within the context of the Sahel and any suggestions for making it more appropriate to Sahelian conditions would be welcomed.

40|$|Description The future uptake {{and success}} of organic systems will rely {{on being able to}} adapt and {{overcome}} production constraints that hamper the sector in an ever-demanding market. In terms of technical constraints to production, weeds have always featured as one of the primary issues concerning both farmers considering conversion and those already converted. Furthermore weed control has been highlighted as a research and development priority by the UKROFS board (1998) and by the Consultation of Organic Farming Research Priorities (2001). There remain a range of weed management challenges that need to be explored and resolved. For example control of ‘difficult’ weeds such as annual grasses and perennial weeds, and the integration of weed control measures into comprehensive management strategies for a range of crops. Constraints, potential solutions and priorities need discussing with all relevant stakeholders to advance organic production. Addressing these issues is critical to maintain the viability of the organic farming system in the current agricultural climate. The proposed review and decision making process will form the main objectives within this project; 1. What scientific literature is available relating to organic weed control? 2. What is the current level of weed infestation on farms and how are they being managed at present? 3. Which systems are being most constrained by weed competition and what are the main research priorities? A participatory research and development (PRD) approach is ideally suited to take full account of farmer and stakeholder opinions focussing on the most important problems and addressing these {{in the context of the}} farmers’ own system. Farmer ideas and practical knowledge will be used in conjunction with sound science to expand and develop current and new management practices. Stakeholders would be invited to prioritise constraints and to formulate potential solutions as well as research plans to overcome them. Experiments to investigate proposed solutions would be carried out on-farm or on-station, as appropriate. The project would pay particular attention to communicating results between all stakeholders in the organic community. Methods of dissemination would include <b>technical</b> <b>leaflets,</b> open days, workshops, popular press articles and where appropriate refereed journals. The development of organic farming systems coincides with DEFRA’s policy objectives of encouraging sustainable, competitive and safe food production whilst enhancing biodiversity. Objective The project will take a participatory approach to problem solving in order to: 1. Review the scientific literature and other sources of information and gather knowledge relating to weed control from organic farmers. 2. Identify and prioritise main production constraints due to weeds 3. Facilitate interest groups of stakeholders. 4. Develop action plans to be trialed on-farm or on-station. 5. Disseminate the results throughout the organic community through open days, workshops, popular press articles, a technical booklet, the web and where appropriate refereed journals...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra Project OF 0127 T. The main {{objective}} of this review was to establish best storage practice for field vegetables, potatoes, cereals and top fruit. A literature review was carried out and information was also gathered from the industry. Information relevant to growers and farmers has been drawn together to provide a comprehensive base from which <b>technical</b> advisory <b>leaflets</b> can be produced. The costs of different storage methods are provided, and case studies used wherever possible. In general, organic crops can be stored using the same methods as conventional crops {{but there is an}} increased risk that sometimes there will be higher storage losses because pesticides and sprout suppressants are not used. On the whole, specific problems with pests and diseases can be avoided using good organic husbandry techniques and by storing undamaged, healthy crops. In the case of cereals storage at correct moisture content and temperatures can avoid pests and moulds. However, there are some areas where more technical development or research would be useful and these have been identified. Relatively few organic growers store vegetables, but in order to maintain a supply of good quality UK produce throughout the year, more long term cold storage space is required (either on farm or in co-operative type stores). Based on the limited data available, economic analysis revealed that long term storage of organic vegetables has generally not been profitable. However, as the market expands in the future, it is likely that storage will become as essential for vegetables as it is for organic cereals and fruit...|$|R

Appropriate technologies use available local resources with minimal damage to the environment and so aim to improve the economic, ecological and socio-cultural conditions of the disadvantaged segments of the population. ISAT provides assistance to all organizations and institutions working in development cooperation through a number of services. These include a question-and-answer service, a range of documentation and publications, and the use of networks to help get information to those whom it would benefit most. Every year almost 3, 000 customers (individuals, institutions or organizations) make use of ISAT's question-and-answer service which is provided free-of-charge for users in developing countries. The service attempts to answer each specific question or complex problem with individual advice provided by the regional adviser responsible. The complexity of the question determines the level of involvement by the ISAT experts. A number of stages can be involved in finding the answer, from the adviser's own knowledge and experience, a literature search, passing the enquiry on to specialized advisory services, companies or institutes, or even arranging for and financing local or external short-term consultancy. ISAT also has its own appropriate technology library providing access to more than 10, 000 documents and books and 250 journals. The documentation centre includes reports and statements, some of which have never been published, and also project reports, scientific literature, and international literature. As with the question-and answer service, these documents are available to all parties in the field of development cooperation free-of-charge. ISAT not only makes documentation available, but offers a number of other services including advice to people looking for literature, consultancy on setting up and developing documentation centres, and training courses for documentalists. ISAT believes in the importance of making information available to the public and uses the knowledge it gains from feedback and enquiries to determine gaps in the information available Experienced experts are then commissioned to close these gaps and make the results of their work available. The appropriate technology information is not just made available through <b>technical</b> books and <b>leaflets,</b> but also journals and the use of films and other media. Advice can also be given on the production and distribution of books, journals and other audiovisual material, as well as organizing exhibitions and other special events. To assist and involve local expertise in their work ISAT cooperates with a number of regional information networks including SIATA based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso for West and Central Africa, RATIS based in Harare, Zimbabwe for East and Southern Africa, MAELA and CLADES in Latin American and RISE-AT in Asia.

His first encounter with the magazine dates back to 1994. At the time, he was finishing his university studies and was doing an internship at the Institut de l environnement et de recherches agricoles (INERA), the agricultural research institute in Burkina Faso where he now works. He found the magazine lying on a table, flicked through it and was captivated. But being a prudent suitor, he was at first happy just to read it, allowing himself occasional furtive visits to his beloved, of whom he still considered himself unworthy. As a young student, I didn t know how to get the magazine, he recalls. I never imagined that I too could receive it. Mr Guissou took his time before subscribing to Spore in 1997. Ever since, his favourite magazine has had a special place on his desk. The issues have piled up over the years. When it fails to arrive on time, he rushes to the documentation centre. Impatient, he fears the worst. In the Netherlands, would the parents of his beloved prevent her from coming out? He could quite believe it, since in his country, a prospective husband must tend the fields of his future in-laws and make them gifts. And he knows he has done none of these things. Then, another thought comes to mind: could she have been carried off by some rival, perhaps by the postman? Comparing the magazine to a talented chef, he confides, I want to discover what she has prepared, in the hope that this time, the dish will be even better than the one before. Like any attentive companion, Spore, plies him with advice. Working on a water and soil conservation project in 1994, Mr Guissou began experimenting with living hedges. These natural barriers protect plants from strong winds in the dry season and ensure that market gardeners get a good crop of vegetables. But to introduce a new technique, {{it is not enough to}} shout it from the rooftops. You need to know how to put across the message, and engineers are not always very good at that. The <b>technical</b> publications and <b>leaflets</b> I order help me to develop the right approach for dealing with rural communities. As a result, I am better able to judge what kind of message to get across to people, and can more easily assess their needs and take their concerns into consideration, explains Mr Guissou. In the articles he writes for specialist magazines, he frequently quotes Spore. Unlike other publications which focus too much on one aspect, Spore has a more multi-disciplinary approach, observes the researcher, who has done work on the jujube, inspired by an article from the magazine.
