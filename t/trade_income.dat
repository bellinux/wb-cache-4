Foreign trading gross receipts also include receipts from certain services provided in connection with such property, as well as engineering and architectural services for construction projects outside the United States.

40|$|Kazakhstan’s {{homelessness}} {{social enterprise}} (SE) practitioners tend {{to argue that}} core to the SE concept {{is the idea that}} this is first and foremost a business whose income generation function enables it to sustain the viability of social projects. A range of important potential lessons for Kazakhstan emerged from work-based SEs in homelessness sector in the UK with respect to SEs’ financial capacity: (a) ideally, a SE might make enough <b>trading</b> <b>income</b> to entirely sustain its own activities and cross-subsidise a charitable arm/organisation; (b) some SEs might make enough financial resources via <b>trading</b> <b>income</b> to entirely sustain their own activities, but only just enough to “break even” so there was no surplus “profit” to invest in charitable programmes; (c) SEs might make some <b>trading</b> <b>income,</b> but this was only enough to cover part of their operational costs, and so the SEs needed some subsidy to invest in social programmes (the cost transfer model); (d) some emerging SEs make no <b>trading</b> <b>income</b> (so required all costs to be met via cost transfer). This means that it is unrealistic to expect employment-based SEs at least to be able to reconcile commercial and social goals in any absolute sense (Teasdale, 2012 a). Kazakh authorities should, therefore, avoid shifting the entire financial responsibility for the social support component of employment-based SEs in the homelessness field themselves...|$|R
40|$|By {{using data}} from {{thirteen}} publicly traded commercial and deposit banks this paper estimates the determinants of market risk for bank equities {{in the case of}} an emerging market setting, Turkey.

Banks with shorter loan maturity positions are regarded by investors as safer companies to invest in while increases in <b>trading</b> <b>income</b> as a source of bank’s overall revenue increases the volatility of its equity returns. Foreign ownership of a bank also lowers its equity return risk. ...|$|R

50|$|Bissone was {{the birthplace}} of the {{architect}} Francesco Borromini and home of numerous construction and architecture dynasties such as the Maderno, Gaggini, Tencalla and Garovaglio families. The local economy always relied primarily on fishing and the fish trade. Under the Old Swiss Confederacy, Bissone, Morcote and Melide had a monopoly on selling fish in Lugano. Another source of income was providing ferries across the lake. During the 14th to 17th Centuries a number of large houses with impressive arcades were built for the local merchants. Later, emigration together with wine, olive and hemp cultivation became the major sources of income. With the construction of the Melide causeway, carrying the road (1847) and railway (1874) from Melide, Bissone lost its traditional <b>trade</b> <b>income.</b> The highway was built in 1966, and separated the old village from the newer housing developments. Since 1950 the economic structure is dominated by the services sector and commuters to Lugano. Bissone is part of the tourist region on Lake Lugano.|$|E

However, on October 12, 1736, Hocquart was faced with an entirely different situation: in his own words, the [...] "trade done at Fort Frontenac and Niagara was becoming from year to year a smaller business."
