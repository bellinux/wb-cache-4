40|$|Combustion {{within the}} {{channels}} {{of a wave}} rotor is examined {{as a means of}} obtaining pressure gain during heat addition in a gas turbine engine. Several modes of combustion are considered and the factors that determine the applicability of three modes are evaluated in detail; premixed autoignition/detonation, premixed deflagration, and non-premixed compression ignition. The last two will require strong turbulence for completion of combustion in a reasonable time in the wave rotor. The compression/autoignition modes will require inlet temperatures in excess of 1500 R for reliable ignition with most hydrocarbon fuels; otherwise, a supplementary ignition method must be provided.

50|$|A {{magnetohydrodynamic}} generator (MHD generator) is a magnetohydrodynamic device that transforms thermal energy and kinetic energy into electricity. MHD generators {{are different from}} traditional electric generators in that they operate at high temperatures without moving parts. MHD was developed because the hot exhaust gas of an MHD generator can heat the boilers of a steam power plant, increasing overall efficiency. MHD was developed as a <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> {{to increase the efficiency}} of electric generation, especially when burning coal or natural gas. MHD dynamos are the complement of MHD propulsors, which have been applied to pump liquid metals and in several experimental ship engines.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetohydrodynamic}} generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, {{without the use}} of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a steam power plant. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the Soviet Union from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular commercial operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time. MHD generators operated as a <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> are currently (2007) less efficient than combined cycle gas turbines.|$|E

This paper examines novel wave rotor <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> that incorporate low-NOx combustion strategies. This approach combines two-stage “rich-quench-lean” (RQL) combustion with intermediate {{expansion in the}} wave rotor to extract energy and reduce the peak stoichiometric temperature substantially. The thermodynamic cycle {{is a type of}} reheat cycle, with the rich-zone air undergoing a high-pressure stage. Rich-stage combustion could occur external to or within the wave rotor. An approximate analytical design method and CFD/combustion codes are used to develop and simulate wave rotor flow cycles. Engine cycles designed with a bypass turbine and external combustion demonstrate a performance enhancement equivalent to a 200 – 400 R (110 – 220 K) increase in turbine inlet temperature. The stoichiometric combustion temperature is reduced by 300 – 450 R (170 – 250 K) relative to an equivalent simple cycle, implying substantially reduced NOx formation...|$|R

Advantages and disadvantages are outlined. Comparison between the theoretic performance (expressed by specific cycle work and overall thermal efficiency) of wave-rotor-topped and baseline engines shows a performance enhancement by up to 33 %. The results obtained show that almost all the cases studied benefit from the wave-rotor-topping, but the highest gain is obtained for the {{case in which the}} topped engine operates with the same turbine inlet temperature and compressor pressure ratio as the baseline engine.

50|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} (LN2) is {{a method}} of storing energy. Energy is used to liquefy air, and then LN2 is produced by evaporation, and distributed. LN2 is exposed to ambient heat {{in the car and}} the resulting nitrogen gas can be used to power a piston or turbine engine. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from LN2 is 213 Watt-hours per kg (W·h/kg) or 173 W·h per liter, in which a maximum of 70 W·h/kg can be utilized with an isothermal expansion process. Such a vehicle with a 350 liter (93 gallon) tank can achieve ranges similar to a gasoline powered vehicle with a 50 liter (13 gallon) tank. Theoretical future engines, using cascading <b>topping</b> <b>cycles,</b> can improve this to around 110 W·h/kg with a quasi-isothermal expansion process. The advantages are zero harmful emissions and superior energy densities compared to a Compressed-air vehicle as well as being able to refill the tank in a matter of minutes.|$|R
50|$|The IGFC system {{combines}} use of SOFCs as a <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> to the {{gas turbine}} or heat recovery steam generator-based bottoming cycle. Typical major components of the IGFC system, this one centered on a SOFC module running at atmospheric pressure, are identified in the simplified cycle diagram.The system fuel as depicted is coal, converted to syngas by the gasifier, which is then supplied to the SOFC module after cleanup and pressure reduction. The syngas pressure reduction step is accomplished in this system concept by an expander/generator, which thereby produces part of the cycle's gross power generation. Oxygen for the coal gasification process is provided by a conventional air separation unit, and steam for the gasifier is raised by power system heat and recycled water. Note that the SOFC module is configured to maintain the anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, and the anode off-gas, which contains some electrochemically-unreacted hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is combusted to completion at the oxy-combustor. Maintaining separation of the off-gas streams restricts the large atmospheric nitrogen content to the cathode side, and simplifies the CO2 capture process to anode off-gas cooling, water-vapor condensation, CO2 drying, and CO2 compression. Compressed CO2 is suitable for carbon utilization or storage (CUS) as appropriate. Heat recovered from the anode-side process {{can be used by}} a power-generating bottoming cycle consisting of a heat recovery steam generator and steam turbine. On the cathode side, process air for the SOFC electrochemical process and for module cooling is provided by an air blower; heat can be recovered from the hot cathode off-gas stream to preheat the process air as needed, and for the generation of additional power.Due to the inherently efficient SOFC, and to using recovered SOFC exhaust heat to generate additional electric power, an IGFC system is capable of operating at a high electric efficiency that significantly exceeds those associated with conventional pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle power systems. IGFC efficiency margins considered achievable, based upon the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory comparative studies of advanced power systems, are apparent in the table provided in subsequent discussion.Improvement in the IGFC cycle efficiency is possible by pressurized operation of the SOFCs, as depicted in the diagram of IGFC with pressurized SOFC cycle. The process is basically similar to the atmospheric-pressure cycle, but it would run the SOFC module at elevated pressure, achieving an SOFC voltage boost, and would replace the cathode-side process-air blower with an air compressor. Also, an expander/generator would be installed in the cathode off-gas stream to reduce gas pressures and generate additional power (this tends to drop the temperature of the gases so much that steam generation to run a steam turbine is not a viable option). Optionally, an expander/generator set could also be placed in the anode off-gas stream, just downstream of the oxy-combustor, and ahead of off-gas heat recovery.|$|E

40|$|Wave rotors {{may play}} a role as <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> for jet engines, since by their use, the {{combustion}} temperature can be raised without increasing the turbine inlet temperature. In order to design a wave rotor for this, or any other application, knowledge of the loss mechanisms is required, and also how the design parameters affect those losses. At NASA LeRC, a 3 -port wave rotor experiment operating on the flow-divider cycle, has been started with the objective of determining the losses. The experimental scheme is a three factor Box-Behnken design, with passage opening time, friction factor, and leakage gap as the factors. Variation of these factors is provided by using two rotors, of different length, two different passage widths for each rotor, and adjustable leakage gap. In the experiment, pressure transducers are mounted on the rotor, and give pressure traces as a function of rotational angle at the entrance and exit of a rotor passage. In addition, pitot rakes monitor the stagnation pressures for each port, and orifice meters measure the mass flows. The results show that leakage losses are very significant in the present experiment, but can be reduced considerably by decreasing the rotor to wall clearance spacing...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{cell gas}} turbine hybrid systems have {{achieved}} ultra-high efficiency and ultra-low emissions at small scales, but {{have yet to}} demonstrate effective dynamic responsiveness or base-load cost savings. Fuel cell systems and hybrid prototypes have not utilized controls to address thermal cycling during load following operation, and have thus been relegated to the less valuable base-load and peak shaving power market. Additionally, pressurized hybrid <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> have exhibited increased stall/surge characteristics particularly during off-design operation. This paper evaluates additional control actuators with simple control methods capable of mitigating spatial temperature variation and stall/surge risk during load following operation of hybrid fuel cell systems. The novel use of detailed, spatially resolved, physical fuel cell and turbine models in an integrated system simulation enables the development and evaluation of these additional control methods. It is shown that the hybrid system can achieve greater dynamic response over a larger operating envelope than either individual sub-system; the fuel cell or gas turbine. Results indicate that a combined feed-forward, P-I and cascade control strategy is capable of handling moderate perturbations and achieving a 2 : 1 (MCFC) or 4 : 1 (SOFC) turndown ratio while retaining > 65 % fuel-to-electricity efficiency, while maintaining an acceptable stack temperature profile and stall/surge margin. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the thermodynamic performance of a novel small-scale power plant that employs a combined cycle for the energy generation from carbon-neutral biomass, such as pruning residues. The combined cycle is composed of an externally fired Joule Brayton cycle followed by a bottoming steam cycle. The <b>topping</b> <b>cycle</b> has the unique particularity of being composed of a cost-effective turbocharger taken from the automotive industry, in place of a more expensive commercial micro-turbine. The turbocharger can be either directly connected to the electric generator (after a few modifications) or coupled (without modifications) with a power turbine moving the generator. The use of solid biomass in the proposed plant is allowed by the presence of an external combustor and a gas-to-gas heat exchanger.

40|$|AbstractSmB 62 single {{crystals}} {{were successfully}} grown by the floating zone (FZ) method. The high-temperature thermoelectric properties were investigated, together with magnetic properties and specific heat at low-temperature. The electrical resistivity, ρ, shows variable-range-hopping (VRH) behavior with significantly lower values than other rare-earth RB 62 (RB 66) compounds. An effective magnetic moment, μeff, of 0. 42  μB/Sm was estimated, which if straightforwardly taken indicates a mixed valency for SmB 62 with Sm 2 +:Sm 3 + =  1 : 1, {{which is the}} first ever indicated for RB 66 -type compounds. Localization length of the VRH at the Fermi level, ξ, was estimated to be 3. 33  Å indicating that carriers in SmB 62 are much less localized than in YB 66 which has 0. 56  Å. The thermoelectric behavior of SmB 62 is striking, with ρ reduced by two orders of magnitude while maintaining large Seebeck coefficients, and as a result the power factor is ∼ 30 times higher than other rare-earth phases. Overall the figure of merit ZT amounts to ∼ 0. 13  at 1050  K, with an extrapolated value of ∼ 0. 4  at 1500  K, an expected working temperature for <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> in thermal power plants; that gives a ∼ 40 times enhancement for Sm.

40|$|Mass {{and energy}} {{balances}} of fluidized bed energy technologies are {{to a significant}} degree dependent upon the specific design being investigated. It is difficult to make any generally accurate comments. about these balances. This study attempts to solve this difficulty by displaying {{a large amount of}} available data, especially on parametric experiments, for the specific designs. To the extent that generalizations about the efficiencies and emissions of these cycles are. possible empirical correlation models have been developed, along with measures of the predictive quality of these models over existing data bases. These empirical correlations consist of probabilistic models that have been fit to published experimental data. In several instances, there have been comparison of these empirical models with available analytic models. In the cases of unavailable experimental data, such as for the potassium <b>topping</b> <b>cycles,</b> models have been fit to analytic data.

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) systems in both power {{stations}} and large plants are {{becoming one of}} the most important tools for reducing energy requirements and consequently the overall carbon footprint of fundamental industrial activities. While power stations employ <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> where the heat rejected from the cycle is supplied to domestic and industrial consumers, the plants that produce surplus heat can utilise bottoming cycles to generate electrical power. Traditionally the waste heat available at high temperatures was used to generate electrical power, whereas energy at lower temperatures was either released to the environment or used for commercial or domestic heating. However the introduction of new engines, such as the ones using the organic Rankine cycle, capable of employing condensing temperatures very close to the ambient temperature, has made the generation of electrical power at low temperatures also convenient. On the other hand, district heating is becoming more and more significant since it has been extended to include cooling in the warm months and underground storage of thermal energy to cope with variable demand. These developments imply that electric power generation and district heating/cooling may become alternative and not complementary solutions for waste energy of industrial plants. Therefore the overall energy management requires the introduction of an optimisation algorithm to select the best strategy. In this paper we propose an algorithm for the minimisation of a suitable cost function, for any given variable heat demand from commercial and domestic users, with respect to all independent variables, i. e., temperatures and flowrates of warm fluid streams leaving the plants and volume and nature of underground storage. The results of the preliminary process integration analysis based on pinch technology are used in this algorithm to provide bounds on the values of temperatures...|$|R

40|$|A novel, {{patented}} <b>topping</b> power <b>cycle</b> {{is described}} that takes its energy {{from a very}} high-temperature heat source and in which {{the temperature of the}} heat sink is still high enough to operate another, conventional power cycle. The top temperature heat source is used to evaporate a low saturation pressure liquid, which serves as the driving fluid for compressing the secondary fluid in an ejector. Due to the inherently simple construction of ejectors, they are well suited for operation at temperatures higher than those that can be used with gas turbines. The gases exiting from the ejector transfer heat to the lower temperature cycle, and are separated by condensing the primary fluid. The secondary gas is then used to drive a turbine. For a system using sodium as the primary fluid and helium as the secondary fluid, and using a bottoming Rankine steam cycle, the overall thermal efficiency can be at least 11 percent better than that of conventional steam Rankine cycles. ...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} are {{extensively}} {{used in the}} aviation and power generation industries. They are used as <b>topping</b> <b>cycles</b> in combined cycle power plants, or as stand alone power generation units. Gains in thermodynamic efficiency can be realized by increasing the turbine inlet temperatures. Since modern turbine inlet temperatures exceed the melting point of the constituent superalloys, {{it is necessary to}} provide an aggressive cooling system. Relatively cool air, ducted from the compressor of the engine is used to remove heat from the hot turbine blade. This air flows through passages in the hollow blade (internal cooling), and is also ejected onto the surface of the blade to form an insulating film (film cooling). Modern land-based gas turbine engines use high Reynolds number internal flow to cool their internal passages. The first part of this study focuses on experiments pertaining to passages with Reynolds numbers of up to 400, 000. Common turbulator designs (45 degree parallel sharp-edged and round-edged) ribs are studied. Older correlations are found to require corrections in order to be valid in the high Reynolds number parameter space. The effect of rotation on heat transfer in a typical three-pass serpentine channel is studied using a computational model with near-wall refinement. Results from this computational study indicate that the hub experiences abnormally high heat transfer under rotation. An experimental study is conducted at Buoyancy numbers similar to an actual engine on a wedge shaped model trailing edge, roughened with pin-fins and equipped with slot ejection. Results show an asymmetery between the leading and trailing surfaces due to rotation - a difference which is subdued due to the provision of pin-fins. Film cooling effectiveness is measured by the PSP mass transfer analogy technique in two different configurations: a flat plate and a typical high pressure turbine blade. Parameters studied include a step immediately upstream of a row of holes; the Strouhal number (quantifying rotor-stator interaction) and coolant to mainstream density ratio.
