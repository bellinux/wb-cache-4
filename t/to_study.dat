40|$|The {{aim of this}} <b>study</b> was <b>to</b> explore {{associations}} between self-esteem, general self-efficacy, and the deep, strategic, and surface approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> Norwegian occupational therapy students (n[*]=[*] 125) completed questionnaires measuring study approaches, self-esteem, and general self-efficacy. Regression analyses were used to explore the direct relationships between self-esteem, general self-efficacy and the approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying,</b> after controlling for age, gender, prior higher education, and time spent on independent studying. General self-efficacy displayed positive associations with deep and strategic approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> and a negative relationship with a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> Self-esteem was not significantly associated with approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study explores gender {{differences}} in approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> for GCSE among high‐achieving pupils. The sample comprised 310 Year 10 and 11 pupils from two single‐sex schools. Pupils completed a self‐reported questionnaire designed to assess approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> for GCSE, including statements relating to coursework, examinations, research, study strategies and homework. Boys gained a higher score overall in the questionnaire, indicating a more effective approach <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> for GCSE. Gender {{differences were found in}} approaches <b>to</b> examinations and <b>study</b> but not in approaches to coursework. The boys reported doing less homework than the girls. The findings suggest that overall high‐achieving boys have better studying strategies than high‐achieving girls. They achieve high standards while doing less homework. Approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> among highachieving girls may be mediated by anxiety that manifests itself in surface approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> for examinations...|$|R
40|$|Achievement goals predict {{learning}} {{in children and}} young adults, but {{it is unclear whether}} they apply to older adults and how they are related <b>to</b> approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> An online survey examined achievement goals, approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> and academic attainment in distance learners.

The findings confirmed the 2 [*]×[*] 2 model of mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals in adult distance learners. Mastery goals were positively associated with deep and strategic approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> but negatively associated with a surface approach. Performance goals showed only weak associations with approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> Performance-approach goals were positively related to attainment, performance-avoidance goals were negatively related to attainment, but mastery goals were unrelated to attainment.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how coping strategies students adopt when preparing for final exams influence their approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> It {{was hypothesized that}} adaptive coping strategies (self-help, approach, and accommodation) {{would be associated with}} the adoption of deep and strategic approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying,</b> whereas maladaptive coping strategies (avoidance and self-punishment) would be associated with the adoption of a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> A sample of 135 undergraduate university students completed the R-COPE, the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST), the Evaluation Anxiety Scale (EVAN), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES) 2 weeks before final exams. In a multivariate regression model controlling for measurement error, gender, and confounding by general self-efficacy and evaluation anxiety, approach coping predicted deep and strategic approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying,</b> self-help coping predicted a strategic approach <b>to</b> <b>studying,</b> and avoidance coping predicted a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> The hypotheses were fully supported for approach and avoidance coping, partially supported for self-help coping, and disconfirmed for accommodation and self-punishment coping.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Education in the School ofTeachers Education)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1996 Students today fuce {{increasing}} {{demands and}} challenges. This {{has important implications}} for education and its relevance in a rapidly changing world. It is against this background that the problem ofsuccess or failure at tertiary level, especially {{in the first year of}} study, is particularly significant as is evident from increased interest in and research undertaken into the factors and determinants involved in success or failure. Two variables that have received considerable attention in recent studies are (1) approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> and (2) locus of control. They have been investigated both as independent factors and as part of a cluster of factors, but the relationship between these two variables has not yet been explored within the technikon context. In terms of students' approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> there are two important schools of thought. One model (Entwistle & Ramsden, 1983) focuses on qualitative differences between the different categories ofapproaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> In terms ofthis model students are classified as either using a reproducing/surface, a meaningldeep or an achieving/strategic approach. The 'Qualitative Individual Differences' model (Meyer, Parsons & Dunne, 1990 a; 1990 b), emphasises the qualitative individual differences in terms ofstudents' approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying.</b> This model defines the concept ofstudy orchestration as the contextualised study approach individual or groups of students adopt. The term orchestration captures the unique nature of individual approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> viewed as a qualitative responsive approach to a qualitatively perceived educational context. The first model therefore views approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> mainly from the point ofview of categorical differences, whereas the second focuses on qualitative individual (across and within categories) differences. In this <b>study</b> students' approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> were measured by the Extended Approaches <b>to</b> <b>Studying</b> Inventory (EASI), a variation on the original Approaches <b>to</b> <b>Studying</b> Inventory (ASI) developed by Entwistle & Ramsden (1983...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{identified the}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> preferred by student nurses, determined whether these changed during the Diploma of Higher Education in Nursing (DipHE Nursing), and which approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> {{were associated with}} greater academic achievement.

40|$|Approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> may be {{influenced}} by students’ age, maturity, and experience in higher education.

Three cohorts of students (n = 160) from one university college completed the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) along with sociodemographic information. One-way analyses of variance were used to identify differences in approaches <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> among the student cohorts. The scores on the ASSIST were largely similar between the cohorts. However, first-year students had higher scores on the surface approach and on syllabus-boundness, compared to third-year students. There was a linear trend of decreasing scores on these two scales: from highest among first-year students to lowest among third-year students.
