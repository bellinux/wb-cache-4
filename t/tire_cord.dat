5000|$|The {{solubility}} of nitrocellulose {{in organic}} solvents such as ether and acetone {{was the basis}} for the first [...] "artificial silk" [...] by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was flammable and more expensive than cellulose acetate or cuprammonium rayon. Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s. Nitrocellulose was briefly known as [...] "mother-in-law silk". Frank Hastings Griffin invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as <b>tire</b> <b>cords</b> and clothing.

50|$|This {{sidewall}} ply to bead tension {{support was}} a big reason for older cross-ply <b>cord</b> <b>tire</b> construction using the materials available in the early 19th century. The cross-ply cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead & wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing plies of cords). However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply <b>cord</b> <b>tires,</b> which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar cross-ply <b>cord</b> <b>tire</b> designs by (a) facilitating a flatter contact pattern with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread & ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.|$|R

40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} study on rayon and nylon <b>tire</b> <b>cords</b> embedded in rubber are reported. Stress-strain curves in tension and compression on thick-walled cylinders of such materials show that much higher moduli of elasticity are exhibited by cords under tension than by cords in compression. However, the compression modulus of twisted cords is not insignificant, and such cords can apparently carry appreciable compressive loads when properly encased in rubber and when prevented from buckling. A bilinear approximation to the stress-strain curves of such materials is proposed {{as a means}} for approximate structural analysis of members utilizing these materials. Based on such a bilinear approximation, an analysis is presented for the state of stress and deformation in a laminated cord-rubber sheet under plane loads, using the principles of orthotropic materials. It is shown that four elastic constants are sufficient to describe the properties of a typical two-ply laminate when all cords are loaded in tension; a differ-ent set or four apply to the same body when it is loaded {{in such a way that}} the cords in both plies are in compression...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{effective}} example of coupled experimental and numerical tests. Moreover, a development process of a numerical model of a terrain vehicle suspension system is presented. Experimental tests were carried out on the machine Instron 8802 with an assistance of the high-speed camera Phantom v 12. Obtained stress-strain curves were applied into the FE model to estimate material constants for Mooney-Rivlin constitutive rubber model and for numerical failure criterion. Geometry of the tire and other suspension elements were achieved using reverse engineering technology. Due to the fact that a tire is such a complex structure to be represented with numerical methods, it was important to develop a discrete model of tire as much similar to the real one as possible. Consequently, an exact <b>tire</b> <b>cords</b> pattern was implemented into the FE model of the tire, which was obtained by the assistance of a microscope and X-ray device. In the next step, numerical analyses were performed simulating the TNT explosion under the suspension system with a simplified motor-car body. Non-linear dynamic simulations were carried out using the explicit LS-Dyna code, with central difference scheme with modified the time integration of the equation of motion. In order to simulate the blast wave propagation the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation with Jones Wilkins Lee (JWL) equation defining the explosive material were used. Finally, results from both approaches were compared...|$|R
