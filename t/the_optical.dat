5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> axis, while the matrix encodes the properties of <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> element.

5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of <b>the</b> <b>optical</b> window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the upper}} and lower bounds for the channel {{capacity}} of dimmable visible light communications(VLC) systems are investigated. Because the information is modulated into <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>optical</b> intensity, <b>the</b> transmitted <b>optical</b> intensity is represented by a nonnegative input that is corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise. Considering the illumination support in a VLC system, <b>the</b> transmitted <b>optical</b> intensity signal must satisfy the illumination constraint, i. e., <b>the</b> average transmitted <b>optical</b> intensity is constrained by a target illumination intensity, which is determined by <b>the</b> nominal <b>optical</b> intensity of <b>the</b> light source devices and dimming target. An upper bound on the channel capacity is derived based on the signal space geometry via a sphere packing argument. A lower bound on the channel capacity is derived by maximizing the mutual information between the channel input and output. Both {{the upper and}} lower bounds are presented in closed forms. Furthermore, a closed-form optimal intensity distribution of <b>the</b> transmitted <b>optical</b> signal is obtained.
