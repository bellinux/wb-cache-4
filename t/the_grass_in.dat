5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Kasey Kahne {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by Carl Edwards, who started second. On the following two laps, Jimmie Johnson took over the fourth position. On the fourth lap, Edwards passed Kahne for the first position. After starting from 37th, Denny Hamlin had moved to 27th by lap six. Eleventh-placed qualifier Jeff Gordon joined team-mate Johnson in the top ten four laps later. Johnson passed A. J. Allmendinger on lap 12 to claim the third position, as David Reutimann and Kurt Busch collided into the wall. Five laps later, the first caution was given after Reutimann collided into the wall again. Most of the front runners made pit stops, except for J. J. Yeley, who didn't pit until the following lap. At the lap 22 restart, Edwards was first, ahead of Kahne, Allmendinger, and Johnson. Hamlin turned sideways and drove through <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> the infield, prompting the second caution on the following lap. Hamlin only sustained minor damage to his splitter. Edwards remained the leader during the restart, while Allmendinger took over second from Kahne.|$|E

30|$|In {{more distant}} comparisons, with longer ancestral {{divergence}} times, colinearity across orthologous regions {{appears to be}} much more rare than within <b>the</b> <b>grasses.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> rice flatsedge, Cyperus iria, the near-adjacent Sh 2 and A 1 homologues appear to be conserved in order and orientation, but one of the two genes <b>in</b> between <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> is missing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sedge (A. Pontaroli and J. Bennetzen, unpub. obs.). However, this is the only comparison that has been done to <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> <b>in</b> this ~ 110 -million-years-of-divergence window [13]. Similarly, Musa (e.g., banana) genomes show some colinearity with <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> after > 115 million years of divergence from their last shared ancestor, but more than 50 % of the annotated genes were non-colinear in a comparison to rice [56]. With even more distant comparison to the eudicots, > 220 million years of independent descent, only rare segments of genic colinearity are observed at either full genome or local genome scales [58].|$|R
5|$|The US$1 million ($ million today) {{project was}} {{initiated}} by Pittsburgh Pirates' owner Barney Dreyfuss, {{with the goal}} of replacing his franchise's then-current home, Exposition Park. The stadium was made of concrete and steel (one of the first of its kind) in order to increase its lifespan. The Pirates opened Forbes Field on June 30, 1909, against the Chicago Cubs, and would play the final game that was also against the Cubs on June 28, 1970. The field itself featured a large playing surface, with the batting cage placed in the deepest part of center field during games. Seating was altered multiple times throughout the stadium's life; at times fans were permitted to sit on <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> the outfield during overflow crowds. The Pirates won three World Series while at Forbes Field and the other original tenant, the Pittsburgh Panthers football team had five undefeated seasons before moving in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Forbes Field had an {{original}} capacity of 25,000, {{the largest in}} the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000seats. On opening day, ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $ today) for box seats and $1 (equal to $ today) for reserved grand stand sections; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50. Ticket prices were considered high for the day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans' views of the field. 2,000 bleachers were situated along the left field side, tickets were sold for a maximum of $1. When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games, fans were permitted to sit on <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> right field, provided they would agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area. The lowest season of attendance came in 1914 when 139,620people attended games; the highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828people watched the Pirates play. On September 23, 1956, the stadium's largest crowd, 44,932, gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut short {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following day. At 200people, June 10, 1938 marked the smallest crowd to ever attend a Pirates game. On September 30, 1962, a crowd of 40,916people saw the Steelers defeated by the New York Giants, at the Steelers' highest-attended game at the stadium.|$|E

25|$|The AstroTurf was {{replaced}} in 2000 {{by a system}} of interchangeable grass trays similar to those put in place for soccer, but was kept in place under the trays to aid in draining the field when it got wet.

25|$|Elasmotherium ("Thin Plate Beast"), {{also known}} as the Giant Rhinoceros of Siberia, is an extinct genus of {{rhinoceros}} endemic to Eurasia during the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene, documented from 2.6 Ma to as late as 29,000years ago in the Late Pleistocene. Three species are recognised. The best known, E. sibiricum, {{was the size of a}} mammoth and is thought to have borne a large, thick horn on its forehead. Theories about the function of this horn include defence, attracting mates, driving away competitors, sweeping snow from <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> winter and digging for water and plant roots. Like all rhinoceroses, elasmotheres were herbivorous. Unlike any others, its high-crowned molars were ever-growing. Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were adapted for galloping, giving it a horse-like gait.|$|E
25|$|In India, the {{practice}} of a hunger protest, where the protestor fasts {{at the door of}} an offending party (typically a debtor) in a public call for justice, was abolished by the government in 1861; this indicates the prevalence of {{the practice}} prior to that date, or at least a public awareness of it. This Indian practice is ancient, going back to around 400 to 750 BC. This can be known since it appears in the Ramayana, which was composed around that time. The actual mention appears in the Ayodhya kanda (the second book of the Ramayana), in Sarga (section) 103. Bharata has gone to ask the exiled Rama to come back and rule the kingdom. Bharata tries many arguments, none of which work, at which point he decides to do a hunger strike. He announces his intention to fast, calls for his charioteer Sumantra to bring him some sacred Kusha grass (which Sumantra won't do, since he's too busy looking at Rama's face, so Bharata has to get the grass himself), and lies down upon <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> front of Rama. Rama, however, is quickly able to persuade him to abandon the attempt. Rama mentions it as a practice of the brahmanas.|$|E

500|$|Notre Dame had {{the worst}} start to their season in program history, opening 0–5 (the {{previous}} record was 0–3) and headed into their game with USC at 1–6.

[...] After Clausen also showed trouble at the position, Weis elected to go with junior Evan Sharpley as the starter for the USC game; Sharpley had backed up Brady Quinn the previous season. [...] In response to controversy over the length of <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>in</b> Notre Dame Stadium during the 2005game, where USC kickoff returner Desmond Reed suffered torn right knee ligaments and nerve damage while trying {{to turn on the}} field, the Fighting Irish cut the grass significantly shorter.
