500|$|Shirley {{also made}} common cause with Samuel Waldo, a wealthy {{merchant}} and major landowner {{in the province}} eastern district (present-day Maine) where Belcher's lax enforcement of <b>timber-cutting</b> laws was harming his business with the Royal Navy. [...] In 1736 Shirley sent his wife to London to lobby on his behalf against Belcher. [...] Waldo also eventually went to London; the combination of Shirley's connection to Newcastle and Waldo's money soon made inroads in the colonial administration. [...] When these were joined by discontented New Hampshire interests (Belcher was also governor of New Hampshire), a full-scale offensive was launched in the late 1730s to unseat Belcher. [...] This included at least one forged letter {{on the part of}} Belcher opponents in an attempt to discredit the governor, which Shirley denounced. [...] By 1738 Newcastle was in a dominant position in not just the colonial administration, but also in the British government as an opponent of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, and he actively encouraged Belcher's opponents.|$|E

60|$|The {{effervescence}} of {{the colony}} caused by this infusion of new elements ere long settled down. The immigrants {{took part in the}} general labour and duties. <b>Timber-cutting,</b> grape-gathering, hay-making, fishing, hunting, exploring, eating, drinking, and sleeping, went on with unabated vigour, and thus, gradually, autumn merged into winter.|$|E
60|$|Tadousac I {{found to}} be similar, in many respects, to the forts in the north. The country around was wild, mountainous, and {{inhabited}} only by a few Indians and wild animals. There was no society, excepting that of Mr Stone's family; the only other civilised being, above the rank of a labourer, being a gentleman who superintended a <b>timber-cutting</b> and log-sawing establishment, {{a quarter of a}} mile from the Company's post.|$|E
60|$|I found Ormond's horses useful; {{for between}} <b>timber-cutting,</b> marking down growing hay, rides to {{purchase}} cattle, and {{visits to the}} Manor, we often covered fifty miles a day, with hard work besides; while, when we brought out Ontario bushmen, Fairmead and the creamery lumber piles increased rapidly in size, and our bank balance diminished as rapidly. Once, too, when I came home so weary that I could scarcely {{get out of the}} saddle, I found a black-edged letter awaiting me, and dropped heavily into a chair after opening it.|$|E
6000|$|Early on the {{following}} morning Michel Voss went off by himself. He could not stay in bed, {{and he could not}} hang about the house. He {{did not know how to}} demean himself to either of the young men when he met them. He could not be cordial as he ought to be with Urmand; nor could he be austere to George with that austerity which he felt would have been proper on his part. He was becoming very tired of his dignity and authority. Hitherto the exercise of power in his household had generally been easy enough, his wife and Marie had always been loving and pleasant in their obedience. Till within these last weeks there had even been the most perfect accordance between him and his niece. 'Send him away;--that's very easily said,' he muttered to himself as he went up towards the mountains; 'but he has got my engagement, and of course he'll hold me to it.' He trudged on, he hardly knew whither. He was so unhappy, that the mills and the <b>timber-cutting</b> were nothing to him. When he had walked himself into a heat, he sat down and took out his pipe, but he smoked more by habit than for enjoyment. Supposing that he did bring himself to change his mind,--which he did not think he ever would,--how could he break the matter to Urmand? He told himself that he was sure he would not change his mind, because of his solemn engagement to the young man; but he did acknowledge that the young man was not what he had taken him to be. He was effeminate, and wanted spirit, and smelt of hair-grease. Michel had discovered none of these defects,--had perhaps regarded the characteristics as meritorious rather than otherwise,--while he had been hotly in favour of the marriage. Then the hair-grease and the rest of it had in his eyes simply been signs of the civilisation of the town as contrasted with the rusticity of the country. It was then a great thing in his eyes that Marie should marry a man so polished, though much of the polish may have come from pomade. Now his ideas were altered, and, as he sat alone upon the log, he continued to turn up his nose at poor M. Urmand. But how was he to be rid of him,--and, if not of him, what was he to do then? Was he to let all authority go by the board, and allow the two young people to marry, although the whole village heard how he had pledged himself in this matter? ...|$|E

50|$|During the 20th century, {{deforestation}} in Thailand {{was driven}} primarily by agricultural expansion, although teak deforestation happened {{as a direct}} result of <b>timber-cutting.</b> Much of Thailand's recent economic improvement can be attributed to increased agricultural production for export. The country was able to increase production by clearing much of their forest and converting it to cropland.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Pysht was a port for the <b>timber-cutting</b> industry, with logging, lumbering, and rail {{facilities}} {{set up by the}} company Merrill & Ring. Merrill & Ring, who first acquired land rights at Pysht in 1886, still owns much of the surrounding land. By the early twenty-first century the town numbered only a few buildings. Activities in the area include forest preservation and hiking, fishing, and crabbing.|$|E
50|$|First work {{settlements}} {{appeared in}} Murmansk Okrug in 1930. One {{of the first}} two settlements was Kukisvumchorr, which was established as an apatite-mining settlement near the mountain of the same name in the Khibiny Massif in the south of Kolsko-Loparsky District, and was granted the work settlement status by the VTsIK Resolution of July 20, 1930. Another one was a nameless settlement, ultimately called Lesnoy, serving a <b>timber-cutting</b> plant in Tersky District.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name may derive from the practice of German farmers who, travelling from Lobethal to Adelaide along the old Bullock Track which passed through the area, would carry their produce in large wicker baskets. It has also been suggested that a Mr Basket was in charge of issuing <b>timber-cutting</b> licences in the very early days; however, {{there is no evidence of}} any Mr Basket having lived there or been in charge of licences.|$|E
50|$|Since 1972, a {{commercial}} logging {{company has been}} operating in the area. The logging company holds a <b>timber-cutting</b> concession for an area of 20000 ha, or 25% of the total area.

In between the hunting ground and the logging area, there is a designated wildlife reserve where deer, water buffalos, wild pigs, bats, flying foxes, and various species of reptiles and birds can be found.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Holt (1811-88) {{purchased}} 13,000 acres (53 km2) in the 1860s {{that stretched}} from Sutherland to Cronulla. The Sutherland area was originally heavily timbered and <b>timber-cutting</b> {{became the first}} industry. Holt initiated many commercial projects including timber cutting, coal mining, sheep farming and oyster farming. He built a forty-room mansion called Sutherland House in 1881 at Sylvania, {{on the bank of}} Gwawley Bay. The mansion was destroyed by fire in 1918, thought to have been deliberately lit.|$|E
50|$|Between 1958 and 1993, {{when the}} last <b>timber-cutting</b> {{took place in the}} BRWMU, about 14500 acre, roughly 22 percent of the water supply drainage, were logged. Since then, to reduce erosion from the outmoded logging infrastructure, the Forest Service and the water bureau have been {{decommissioning}} parts of the Bull Run forest road network, which had grown to 346 mi. By autumn 2008, they had closed 78 mi of roads, were dismantling another 63 mi, and were removing 245 culverts.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} century or so a {{combination}} of factors caused further ecological devastation of the island, which had already been impacted by the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals, as well as by unrestricted hunting, <b>timber-cutting</b> and wildfire caused by sealers and other visitors. The Amsterdam duck and several species of petrel became extinct, and the breeding population of the endemic Amsterdam Island albatross, previously thought to be a subspecies of the wandering albatross, was reduced to just five pairs.|$|E
50|$|This enables {{engineers}} {{to determine the}} proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for TNT. For example, if a <b>timber-cutting</b> formula calls for a charge of 1 kg of TNT, then based on octanitrocubane's RE factor of 2.38, it would take only 1.0/2.38 (or 0.42) kg of it {{to do the same}} job. Using PETN, engineers would need 1.0/1.66 (or 0.60) kg to obtain the same effects as 1 kg of TNT. With ANFO or ammonium nitrate, they would require 1.0/0.74 (or 1.35) kg or 1.0/0.42 (or 2.38) kg, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{early work}} in the area was <b>timber-cutting</b> and small farming. The railway station opened 17 May 1890. A large portion of Penshurst located south of the railway line is {{referred}} to as the MacRae's Estate, as it was once owned by the MacRae family. This particular area is now between Laycock Road and Grove Avenue, and Hillcrest and Railway Parade. The original homestead is still present on Laycock Road, along with a caretakers house for the stables. McRaes Reserve used to have a river running through it and the path of that river is now replaced with an underground rainwater system.|$|E

Though the Tamil Nadu government has built houses for a few Paliyan families at Kurinji Nagar (8 km west of Usilampatti), several of the Paliyan are without proper houses. The future of the Paliyan is very tenuous now that the forests, which are denuded due to illegal poaching and <b>timber-cutting</b> by {{the people from the}} plains, have much less area and biodiversity.|$|E
