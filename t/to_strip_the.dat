5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off. The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway's overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, and turned the castle into a total ruin.|$|E

5|$|The {{award was}} inaugurated in 1964, when Swimming World named Don Schollander as its World Swimmer of the Year. Two years later, a female {{category}} was added, and the awards continued in this format until 1980. The winners were mostly American until {{the rise of}} East Germany's women in the 1970s, and 1980 saw the creation of subcategories for American and European swimmers. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, Germany declined following the end of the East's systematic state-sponsored doping program, while Australia's swimming team enjoyed a revival. In December 2013, Swimming World announced a decision <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> drug-fueled East Germans of all World and European Swimmers of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind of country music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E

5|$|After finding all the Masters, the Exile travels back to Dantooine and {{learns that}} the countless deaths at Malachor V {{resulted}} in the Exile unconsciously giving up connection to the Force, which then became {{the teachings of the}} new Sith. If the player aided the Jedi Masters, they prepare <b>to</b> <b>strip</b> <b>the</b> Exile of their Force connection permanently, as the Masters fear that these teachings could result in the actual death of the Force, but Kreia reveals herself to be the former leader of the Sith and murders them all in retribution. If the player killed the Jedi Masters, Kreia attacks the Exile and leaves. Tracking Kreia to Telos, the Exile fights and defeats a corrupted Atris, from whom it is learned that Kreia plans to strengthen a massive wound in the Force made ten years prior. This wound had been created by the Exile during the Mandalorian Wars, when they activated a superweapon in order to end the battle on the planet Malachor V, causing mass death and destruction. Before following her to Malachor V, where Kreia had since rejoined the Sith as Darth Traya, the Exile stops a Sith invasion of Telos, defeating one of Traya's former apprentices, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus. On Malachor V, the Exile is separated from their companions and fights through hordes of monsters on the planet's surface and the inhabitants of a large Sith Academy that survived the cataclysm. On the final floor of the academy, the Exile kills the Sith Lord Darth Sion and confronts Darth Traya in the planet's core.|$|E
