5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit is larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

5|$|The hindfeet {{are long}} and have the three central digits longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> outer ones. They are white to pale yellow above, where the foot is covered with hairs, which are longer than in T.bolivaris. The digits of the hindfeet are {{surrounded}} by ungual tufts of silvery hair that are longer than the claws themselves. The claws are short and sharp. Parts of the sole are covered by indistinct scales (squamae), which are usually entirely absent in T.bolivaris. The pads are moderately large.|$|E
5|$|Unlike his {{predecessor}} Urtarte, who requested financing to supply and improve San Antonio, Angulo y Sandoval {{decided to build}} a new castle, one better able to defend the city <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> existing fortifications.

Its basic design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device {{to be able to do}} so.

5|$|Cardiff City {{began their}} {{campaign}} for the 1926–27 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against Aston Villa. After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa attempted to save the match, but were unable to score until goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff played Darlington away. Newspaper reports {{indicated that they were}} the better team, but {{had it not been for}} the success of Darlington's defence then they would have won by greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> goal margin they achieved. Goals came from George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1668 when Angulo y Sandoval's predecessor, Juan de Urtarte, wrote a {{memorandum}} to the King of Spain {{stating that the}} San Antonio de la Eminencia castle was unfit for defense. Several years later (and without proper authorization), Angulo y Sandoval began construction of a fortress {{that would be more}} useful for the defense of the city <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> existing fortifications. The castle underwent several renovations to repair damage caused by severe earthquakes. A 1684 quake severely damaged the castle and another in 1929 left the structure in ruins. The castle was declared a cultural and municipal asset in May 2005.|$|E

5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, {{was found in a}} specimen of the duck-like Vegavis iaai dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> systems evolving independently. A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size. The crests of the Lambeosaurini and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance, though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.|$|E

5|$|The gate, {{built of}} large square blocks of {{polished}} white marble fitted together without cement, has {{the form of}} a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn quadriga on top, echoing the Porta Triumphalis of Rome, which survived until it fell down in an earthquake in 740. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an earthquake in 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the City. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones.|$|E

Jani and Lieb qualified in third position, three-tenths of a second slower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sister Porsche cars. Lotterer twice went onto the track and improved his first lap time by 0.116 seconds to 1:55.114, while Fässler {{was unable to find}} a rhythm, and could not improve on his co-driver's fastest time, restricting them to qualifying fourth. Duval and di Grassi took fifth place with the latter stating that the team was not happy with the No. 8 car's setup, and that overnight work had to be undertaken. Davidson and Buemi held fifth place until di Grassi and Duval's lap times demoted them to sixth. Conway and Sarrazin secured seventh with the latter saying that he was held up by slower cars on his two timed laps. Albuquerque and Rast filled the grid's fourth row by qualifying eighth ahead of the No. 4 Team ByKolles car.|$|E
5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) {{is estimated}} to have been 286mm (11in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317mm long (12in).|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
