5|$|Submarine eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption that occurs underwater. An estimated 75% of the total volcanic eruptive volume is generated by submarine eruptions near mid ocean ridges alone, however because of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> detecting deep sea volcanics, they remained virtually unknown until advances in the 1990s {{made it possible to}} observe them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have had considerable environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Phipps' lack of {{professional}} training as an historian become clear {{by the third}} volume. Despite his reading of newly published works, Phipps' idea of what constituted new material included the publications of memoirs and journals of the participants, not the extensive secondary literature and array of historiographical material in the periodic literature written by professional historians seeking to understand the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Consequently, Phipps' perceptions of the French revolution remained rooted in the outdated theories of Archibald Alison, Adolphe Thiers, and others, while ignoring {{some of the new}} theories of Albert Sorel, François Victor Alphonse Aulard and Albert Mathiez. His military background emerged clearly in his hostility to the meddling of the French government in the affairs of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} peptides against P. acnes {{is under}} investigation {{as a treatment for}} acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.|$|E
5|$|Though Sachsen entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the poor performance of Sachsen in the 1880 maneuvers and the negative reputation of the class. Among <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were laid down. The poor performance of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the roads}} along which the A1 route travels {{are shared by}} the {{individual}} local boroughs, the Greater London Authority (GLA), and the British Government. The first organised London-wide authority dealing with roads in London was the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), set up in 1856. The MBW replaced the disparate turnpike trusts which had already been amalgamated in 1826 into the single control of Government Commissioners, and was itself replaced by the London County Council (LCC) in 1889. The LCC became the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1965, and during the 1960s when traffic management in London was being modernised, and the London Ringways was proposed, the GLC, which was not in favour of increasing traffic into central London, had control of the inner London roads, while the government, through the Ministry of Transport, which was in favour of widening roads, had control of outer London. These different approaches resulted in the Ministry of Transport widening a stretch of the A1 until it reached {{the control of the}} GLC, when the widening abruptly stopped. Due to <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> two different and opposing bodies having responsibility for London's roads, the government were keen {{to take control of the}} major routes, and made plans in 1983 for the Department of Transport to take over 70 miles of road, including significant parts of the A1; when the GLC was abolished in 1986, the Department of Transport took over direct control of the 70 miles of major routes, plus had a significant influence on another 300. In 2000 control of roads in London passed to Transport for London, a department of GLA created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, and the major roads, including the A1, were declassified as trunk roads.|$|E
