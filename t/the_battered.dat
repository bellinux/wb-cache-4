5000|$|On {{the fourth}} ball, {{it is called}} a walk, and <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> becomes a runner, and is {{entitled}} to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a base on balls or a walk (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> clothes), <b>the</b> umpire declares a hit by pitch (abbreviated HBP) and <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit <b>the</b> <b>batter,</b> or that <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> {{did not attempt to}} avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> awarded first. In addition, if <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> and/or <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> bat as <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is attempting to hit a pitch, <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, ruled [...] "catcher's interference".|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>batter</b> is out if: {{three strikes}} are called (a [...] "strikeout"); a ball hit by <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> is caught before {{touching}} the ground (a [...] "flyout"); <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> {{goes to a}} base that is already tagged ("tagged" [...] or [...] "tag play"); a fielder holding the ball touches a base {{which is the only}} base towards which <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> may run before <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> arrives there (a [...] "force out" [...] or [...] "force play"); or in certain special circumstances. There is also a not so common occurrence when <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> has 2 strikes and swings at strike three.

5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Cumby {{took charge}} of <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Bellerophon, {{directing}} her fire into Aigle and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. Bellerophon had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded. Although Aigle {{was lost in the}} chaotic storm which followed the battle, Bellerophon survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action. Cooke's body was buried at sea the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from Bellerophon.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Cadiz, Linois {{had learned from}} {{the crew of the}} {{captured}} brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz, blockading the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of Algeciras, just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar. Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, HMS Hannibal grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore. With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. <b>The</b> <b>battered</b> British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for Hannibal, which was trapped, battered and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.|$|E
5|$|I/28 {{captured}} Vlasenica on 28 April, but {{was almost}} immediately attacked {{from the east}} by two Partisan divisions. A third Partisan division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at Šekovići, 30kilometres north-west of Vlasenica. Both II/28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica, where II/28 relieved <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> I/28 and then surrounded Šekovići. After a 48-hour battle, during which II/28 was decimated, the town was taken.|$|E

5|$|During the day, Boadicea {{continued}} to close until Victor {{was forced to}} abandon Ceylon and sail in support of Vénus at 15:30. As soon as the French prize crew was removed, Lieutenant Philip Fitz Gibbon, the remaining officer on Ceylon, rehoisted British colours and assumed control of the ship. This allowed Boadicea to sail past the recaptured frigate and engage the French ships directly, reaching Vénus at 16:40. Hamelin recognised that <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> state of his flagship meant {{that he would not}} be able to adequately defend against Rowley's attack and ordered Victor to take news of his defeat back to Port Napoleon. Readying his ship for a token action, Hamelin fired at Boadicea as she came up but was forced to surrender within ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, {{the tail}} of the Dutch line {{disintegrated}} into a chaotic melee, with eight British ships of the line fighting four Dutch and the frigate Monnikkendam. So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into one another in the high seas, heavy rain and poor visibility. The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E
50|$|The chalk lines {{delineating}} the two Foul Lines {{are rarely}} extended through <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually {{for the purpose}} of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of <b>the</b> <b>Batter's</b> Boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist {{for the purpose of}} the rules pertaining to <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box and <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> position relative thereto.|$|R
50|$|There are two batter's boxes, one on {{each side}} of home plate. <b>The</b> <b>batter's</b> boxes are 4 feet wide (1.2 m) and 6 feet long (1.8 m). <b>The</b> <b>batter's</b> boxes are {{centered}} lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter's box 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed batter would stand in <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box on <b>the</b> left side of home plate {{from the perspective of the}} catcher and umpire. A left-handed batter would stand in <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box to their right. A batter may only occupy one batter's box at a time and may not legally leave <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box after <b>the</b> pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> wish to leave <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box once <b>the</b> pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>battered</b> {{village of}} Charektar in Kelbajar {{had already seen}} {{extensive}} fighting in earlier weeks and was reinforced by both Azerbaijani and foreign fighters as the Armenian offensive commenced on March 27. However, instead of launching a simultaneous attack, only the units in Aghdaban and Narinclar moved out. Melkonian's armored column did not move out until later on and his units faced tenacious resistance on an embankment of entrenched defenses where his forces were forced to retreat. The troops in Vardenis began their assault shortly thereafter but their advance was slowed since they had to trek through the snowy passes of the Murov Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Villaret in Montagne, having {{successfully}} broken {{contact with}} the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships {{together to create a}} new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Terrible, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and Républicain—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.|$|E
5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. <b>The</b> <b>battered</b> fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

5000|$|In baseball, a brushback {{pitch is}} a pitch-usually a fastball-thrown high {{and inside the}} strike zone to intimidate <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> away from <b>the</b> plate on {{subsequent}} pitches. [...] It differs from the beanball in that the intent is not to hit <b>the</b> <b>batter,</b> nor does it target <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> head. Hitters will often crowd the plate {{in order to have}} a better swing at pitches on the outside half of the plate. The hitters hope that the pitcher will be scared to throw inside because they might hit <b>the</b> <b>batter.</b> <b>The</b> brushback helps a pitcher to [...] "reclaim" [...] the corners of the strike zone by forcing <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> to stand farther away.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>batter</b> can {{swing at}} an {{intentional}} ball, but cannot leave <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> box {{to follow the}} pitch. Swinging is rarely to <b>the</b> <b>batter's</b> advantage. In <b>the</b> Major Leagues, there were 12 cases from 1900 through 2011 of a batter making contact with an intentional ball. In 9 of these cases, <b>the</b> <b>batter</b> reached first base safely (six by hits, one by fielder's choice, and two by errors). <b>The</b> <b>batter's</b> team won in all nine of those instances. Most recently, on September 10, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays opted to walk Gary Sanchez of the hosting New York Yankees. He drove an intentional ball to left field for a sacrifice fly.|$|R
5|$|After {{passing the}} gun batteries, {{the crew of}} Blücher, {{including}} the personnel manning the guns, were tasked with fighting the fire. By that time she {{had taken on a}} list of 18degrees, although this was not initially problematic. The fire eventually reached one of the ship's 10.5cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2/3, which exploded violently. The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship's fuel stores. <b>The</b> <b>battered</b> ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given. Blücher rolled over and sank at 07:30, with significant casualties. Naval historian Erich Gröner states that the number of casualties is unknown, but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1,000 soldiers and sailors. Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. <b>The</b> <b>battered</b> expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order <b>the</b> <b>battered</b> Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E
