5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} <b>them</b> <b>against</b> nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage <b>them</b> <b>against</b> the ground and sky respectively.|$|E

There were three additional attacks on Lysaker in 1944 and 1945, two of <b>them</b> <b>against</b> factories and workshops.

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging <b>them</b> <b>against</b> a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing {{to take account of}} the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E

In 1943 he was {{appointed}} a Royal Designer for Industry for the design of transport equipment. He was awarded honorary doctorates by Manchester University in 1936 and London University in 1946.

Ine may not have recovered any of the lands north of the Thames {{that had belonged to}} the West Saxons under previous kings, but it is known that he controlled the southern bank: a charter dated 687 shows him giving land to the church at Streatley on the Thames and at nearby Basildon.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{immediately}} {{sued the}} British Government for false imprisonment, {{and to avoid}} any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify <b>them</b> <b>against</b> any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared {{so that it would}} only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.|$|E
