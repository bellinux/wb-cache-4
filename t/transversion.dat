25|$|Substitution mutations, often {{caused by}} {{chemicals}} or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. These changes {{are classified as}} transitions or transversions. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition {{can be caused by}} nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a <b>transversion,</b> which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a <b>transversion</b> is the conversion of adenine (A) into a cytosine (C). A point mutation are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality).|$|E
25|$|Note: There is here a {{possible}} confusion between two {{meanings of the}} word transition. (i) In the context of Markov chains, transition is the general term that refers to the change between two states. (ii) In the context of nucleotide changes in DNA sequences, transition is a specific term that refers to the exchange between either the two purines (A ↔ G) or the two pyrimidines (C ↔ T) (for additional details, see the article about transitions in genetics). By contrast, an exchange between one purine and one pyrimidine is called a <b>transversion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Models of DNA {{evolution}} {{were first}} proposed in 1969 by Jukes and Cantor, assuming equal transition rates {{as well as}} equal equilibrium frequencies for all bases. In 1980 Kimura introduced a model with two parameters: one for the transition {{and one for the}} <b>transversion</b> rate and in 1981, Felsenstein proposed a four-parameter model in which the substitution rate corresponds to the equilibrium frequency of the target nucleotide. Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano (HKY) unified the two last models to a five-parameter model. In the 1990s, models similar to HKY were developed and refined by several researchers.|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} eight independent <b>transversions</b> at CpG in 290 consecutive families with hemophilia B.

25|$|It is {{challenging}} to identify rare variants accurately using standard NGS methods with the mutations rate of (10−2 - 10−3). Errors that happen early during sample preparation {{can be detected}} as rare variants. An example of such errors is C>A/G>T <b>transversion</b> that is detected in low frequencies using deep sequencing or targeted capture data and arise {{as the result of}} DNA oxidation during sample preparation. These types of false positive variants are filter out by duplex sequencing method since mutations need to be accurately matched in both strands of DNA to be validated as true mutations. Duplex sequencing can theoretically detect mutations with frequencies as low as 10−8 compare to 10−2 rate of standard NGS methods.|$|E
25|$|ROS-related {{oxidation}} of DNA {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks. It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenine, leading to a G→T <b>transversion</b> mutation. The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis.

40|$|The {{mutation}} {{process is}} a classical evolutionary genetic process. The type of mutations studied here is the random substitutions of a purine base R (adenine or guanine) by a pyrimidine base Y (cytosine or thymine) and reciprocally (transver-sions). The analytical expressions derived allow us to analyze in genes the occurrence probabilities of motifs and d-motifs (two motifs separated by any d bases) on the R/Y alphabet under <b>transversions.</b> These motif probabilities can be obtained after <b>transversions</b> (in the evolutionary sense; from the past to the present) and, unexpect-edly, also before <b>transversions</b> (after back <b>transversions,</b> in the inverse evolutionary sense, from the present to the past). This theoretical part in Section 2 is a first generalization of a particular formula recently derived. The application in Section 3 {{is based on the}} analytical expression giving the autocorrelation function (the d-motif probabilities) before <b>transversions.</b> It allows us to study primitive genes from actual genes.

2500|$|The {{use of a}} {{model of}} {{evolution}} accounts {{for the fact that}} not all events are equally likely to happen. For example, a transition, which is a type of point mutation from one purine to another, or from one pyrimidine to another is much more likely to happen than a <b>transversion,</b> which is the chance of a purine being switched to a pyrimidine, or vice versa. These differences are not captured by maximum parsimony. However, just because some events are more likely than others {{does not mean that they}} always happen. [...] We know that throughout evolutionary history there have been times when there was a large gap between what was most likely to happen, and what actually occurred. When this is the case, maximum parsimony may actually be more accurate because it is more willing to make large, unlikely leaps than maximum likelihood is. Maximum likelihood has been shown to be quite reliable in reconstructing character states, but it does not do as good of a job at giving accurate estimations of the stability of proteins. Maximum likelihood always overestimates the stability of proteins, which makes sense since it assumes that the proteins that were made and used were the most stable and optimal. The merits of maximum likelihood have been subject to debate, with some having concluded that maximum likelihood test represents a good medium between accuracy and speed. However, other studies have complained that maximum likelihood takes too much time and computational power to be useful in some scenarios.|$|E

The level of guanine in 4 -fold degenerated sites (G 4 f) is significantly lower in genes from lagging strands than in genes from leading strands, probably because of the faster rates of guanine oxidation in single-stranded DNA leading to G to T <b>transversions.</b> The rates of cytosine deamination causing C to T transitions are also higher in lagging strands.
