25|$|On the {{diplomatic}} front, the Soviets had proposed to the Chinese the convening of a <b>tripartite</b> <b>conference,</b> {{similar to that}} of 1914-15, to discuss Mongolia's relationship with China. The Chinese government, however, emboldened by the prospect of Zhang's expedition, responded that Mongolia was part of China, and thus could not be the subject of international negotiations. It was not until 1924 that a Chinese-Soviet treaty was concluded, by which the Soviet Union recognised Mongolia {{as an integral part of}} China, and agreed to withdraw its troops. The treaty notwithstanding, the death of the Khutuktu in that same year provided an opportunity for the MPP to dispense with theocratic rule entirely, and the Party announced the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. In 1945, the Chinese Nationalist government recognised the full sovereignty of the Mongolian People's Republic, though Chiang Kai-shek was to withdraw that recognition a few years later. However, in 2002 the Republic of China did recognize Mongolia as independent.|$|E

40|$|British {{influence}} on the diplomacy of WWII, {{as it relates to}} postwar planning, is underappreciated. This work explores how the use of astute tactical maneuvering allowed Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden to impact the development of the post-war world in a greater degree than is typically portrayed in the narratives of the war. Detailing how the study of business negotiations can provide new insights into diplomatic history, Yalta exposes Britain’s impact on the creation of the post-war order through analyzing the diplomacy of WWII as a negotiation. To depict WWII post-war planning diplomacy as a negotiation means that the Yalta Conference of 1945 must be the focal point of said diplomacy with all the negotiations either flowing to or from the conference. This analysis reveals that Britain harnessed the natural momentum of the negotiation process to create bilateral understandings that protected or advanced their interests in ways that should not have been afforded the weakest party in the Grand Alliance. By pursuing solutions to the major wartime issues first and most stridently through the use of age-old British diplomatic tactics, they were able to enter into understandings with another member of the Grand Alliance prior to the <b>tripartite</b> <b>conferences.</b> Creating bilateral understandings with the Americans on the direction of military operations and the Soviets over the European settlement produced the conditions under which the tripartite negotiations transpired. Options available to the excluded party were thus limited, allowing for outcomes that aligned more favorably to British interests. A synthesis of diplomatic documents, diaries, and memoirs with historical writings as well as research on business and international negotiations brings to life the diplomatic encounters that {{led to the creation of}} the post-war order. To provide the reader a basis for analysis of wartime diplomacy, this work is broken down into two parts. Part I focuses on the strategies created for Yalta. Part II (future doctoral dissertation) will use these strategies to evaluate the performances of each party. Combined the two parts expose that British diplomatic maneuverings is an undervalued aspect of wartime diplomacy...|$|R

Canada, through General Andrew McNaughton as the President of the United Nations’ Security Council, managed to break the deadlock in the negotiation on resolving the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands that resulted in the adoption of Resolution 67/1949, which endorsed the establishment of a Dutch-Indonesian Round Table <b>Conference.</b> <b>Tripartite</b> negotiations lead to the international recognition of Indonesia’s sovereignty in December 1949.|$|R
50|$|From {{the very}} {{inception}} {{of the idea of}} Minimum Wages, the aim of policy makers was to set up a uniform wage rate across the entire country. However, such a policy would not be connected to reality due to regional differences over consumption patterns, paying capabilities of employers, requirements of employees, etc. Hence the modified aim was to achievefloor level minimum wage for regions and then further it to a national floor minimum wage. However, not everybody supported this view. In 1955, during the <b>Tripartite</b> Labour <b>Conference,</b> labour representatives demanded immediate fixation of a minimum wage at national level, at least in agriculture. The most recent development in this debate involves the Labour Ministry and the Commerce and Industry Ministry at loggerheads over the introduction of a National floor level minimum wage rate. The Commerce and Industry Ministry is of the argument that a national rate would further burden the industry that is anyway incurring heavy costs. On the other hand, the Labour Ministry has given a proposal to the Centre to impose a national floor to wage rates and most state governments have approved for it. After a two-day strike ending on 21 February 2013, PM Manmohan Singh announced that all unskilled workers would be paid the national floor level minimum wage. This would be included in one of the many amendments of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 to be introduced this year. Currently the floor level of minimum wages is 115, though Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have set lower floors.|$|R
