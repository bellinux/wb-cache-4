6000|$|The President of the United States {{was to be}} congratulated, as {{were the}} {{officers}} of the army, and the engineers of the work. San Francisco had arranged a monster celebration marked by the booming of cannon and enthusiastic parades. Free railroad tickets into Sacramento were to fill that city with jubilant crowds. At Omaha cannons were to be fired, business abandoned, and the whole city given over to festivity. Chicago was to see a great parade and decoration. In New York a hundred guns were <b>to</b> <b>boom</b> <b>out</b> the tidings. Trinity Church was to have special services, and the famous chimes were to play [...] "Old Hundred." [...] In Philadelphia a ringing of the Liberty Bell in Independence Hall would initiate a celebration. And {{so it would be}} in all prominent cities of the Union.|$|E

60|$|One night Edward Hooper, having {{consulted}} {{his watch}} frequently, and compared {{it with the}} clock of slow notoriety in the warehouse in Tooley Street, until his patience was almost gone, at last received the warning hiss, and had his books shut and put away before the minute-gun began <b>to</b> <b>boom.</b> He was <b>out</b> {{at the door and}} half-way up the lane, with his hat a good deal on one side of his head and very much over one eye, before the last shot was fired.|$|R
40|$|MAXIMUM 200 WORDS) This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} {{a new piece of}} oil pollution equipment called the Boom Vane TM in Martha's Vineyard and New York harbor. The equipment is designed <b>to</b> hold <b>boom</b> <b>out</b> in fast currents to recover oil without the use of heavy anchoring equipment. It was shown to be effective in a previous test on the Columbia River. This was the first attempt at using the Boom Vane TM in tidal estuaries. It was also deployed from two vessels as a possible replacement for the outriggers needed <b>to</b> hold <b>boom</b> away {{from the side of the}} vessel in Vessel of Opportunity Skimming Systems (VOSS). The Boom Vane TM does not appear to be useful in tidal estuaries when currents are not steady and uniform. The equipment can be used for parts of a tidal cycle but eddies and interrupted flow caused by changing tides prevent the equipment from being effective throughout the cycle. It still could be used on vessels larger than 50 feet, although a small outrigger boom may still [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The game, {{originally}} named [...] "Fract," [...] {{was developed}} by Richard Flanagan {{as part of his}} student work at the University of Montreal and achieved wide interest after winning the Student Showcase award at the 2011 Independent Games Festival and release of a freely available demo. Flanagan brought aboard Quynh Nguyen and Henk <b>Boom</b> <b>to</b> flesh <b>out</b> the game, branding themselves Phosfiend Systems. They received funding help from the Indie Fund to complete the title. The game was originally planned to span several levels, but due to complexity, it was reduced to a single primary level representing a synthetic oscillator, shorted to [...] "OSC" [...] for the game's final release.|$|R
5000|$|Titov {{made his}} first space flight on April 20, 1983, as {{commander}} of Soyuz T-8. He and Strekalov had been specifically trained to repair the faulty Salyut 7 solar array. He was supposed to dock with Salyut 7, but once in orbit the Soyuz rendezvous radar antenna failed to deploy properly. Several attitude control maneuvers at high rates were made but failed <b>to</b> swing the <b>boom</b> <b>out.</b> (The postflight inquiry later discovered that the antenna had been torn off when the Soyuz payload shroud separated.) With FCC permission, the crew attempted a rendezvous using only an optical sight and ground radar inputs for guidance. During the final approach, which was made in darkness, Titov believed that the closing speed was too great. He therefore attempted a braking maneuver, but felt that the two spacecraft were still closing too fast. He aborted the rendezvous to avoid a crash, and no further attempts were made before the three men returned to Earth after a flight lasting just 2 days, 17 minutes, 48 seconds ...|$|R

50|$|Once {{in orbit}} the Soyuz {{rendezvous}} radar antenna <b>boom</b> failed <b>to</b> deploy properly. Several attitude control maneuvers at high rates were made but failed <b>to</b> swing the <b>boom</b> <b>out.</b> (The postflight inquiry later {{discovered that the}} antenna had been torn off when the Soyuz payload shroud separated.) The crew believed the <b>boom</b> remained attached <b>to</b> the spacecraft’s orbital module, {{and that it had}} not locked into place. Accordingly, they shook the spacecraft using its attitude thrusters in an effort to rock it forward so it could lock. With FCC permission, the crew attempted a rendezvous using only an optical sight and ground radar inputs for guidance. During the final approach, which was made in darkness, Titov believed that the closing speed was too great. He therefore attempted a braking maneuver, but felt that the two spacecraft were still closing too fast. He aborted the rendezvous to avoid a crash, and no further attempts were made. The abortive docking attempts consumed much propellant. To ensure that enough would remain to permit deorbit, the cosmonauts shut down the attitude control system and put Soyuz T-8 into a spinstabilized mode of the type used by Soyuz Ferries in the early 1970s. The three men returned to Earth after a flight lasting just 2 days, 17 minutes, 48 seconds and landing occurred as normal.|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{simulation of}} deployment dynamics {{of these two}} axis concepts {{as well as the}} evolution of practical designs for the add on deployable inertia boom units is described. With the <b>boom</b> free <b>to</b> swing back in response to Coriolis forces as well as outwards in response to centrifugal forces, the kinematics of motion are complex but admit the possibility of absorbing deployment energy in frictional or other damping devices about the radial axis, where large amplitude motions can occur and where the design envelope allows more available volume. An acceptable range is defined for frictional damping for any given spin rate. Inadequate damping allows boom motions which strike the spacecraft; excessive damping causes the <b>boom</b> <b>to</b> swing <b>out</b> and latch with damaging violence. The acceptable range is a design parameter and must accommodate spin rate tolerance and also the tolerance and repeatability of the damping mechanisms...|$|R
