5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} in 1899 and opened to passengers on 20 July 1903, following its electrification in 1902. After the railway grouping of 1923, passenger numbers declined so significantly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and that service was withdrawn. The railway closed to freight in 1959, following the hospital's decision to convert its coal boilers to oil, which rendered the railway unnecessary.|$|E

Reyes, however, wakes up moments later {{in the same room}} all alone. Running to the door, she discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> is floating in a dark void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, maintains that they are still alive.|$|E
5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and {{the places}} of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E

It is later revealed that it was actually Christian's operation; Jack was called in by a nurse after it becomes apparent {{that his father was}} performing the surgery under the influence of alcohol.

5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v.

The Court found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her.

5|$|At {{the railway}} {{grouping}} of 1923, the LBSCR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway and the agreements between the hospital (renamed the East Sussex Mental Hospital in 1919) and the LBSCR were updated. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was drastically shortened in 1922. Because service levels depended on patient numbers and the hospital's coal and food requirements, the line never operated to a timetable. By 1931, passenger numbers had fallen to such an extent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger car was moved to the hospital grounds, fitted with an awning, and became the hospital's sports pavilion. surviving into the mid-1990s before being destroyed in a fire started by vandals. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was removed in 1932, and the platform at the hospital was converted into a coal bay.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could have concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney {{would have seen the}} ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

40|$|In 1993 the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) began public {{release of}} {{risk-adjusted}} monitoring of outcomes (RAMO) under <b>the</b> California <b>Hospital</b> Outcomes Project.

We found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> generally did minimal analyses of the OSHPD RAMO data and considered the data of little value to them. Only 3 hospitals initiated quality improvement activities based on their data review. The major reasons given by <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> for not using the RAMO data were that their outcomes were adequate, as verified by a comparison of their observed outcomes and those expected after risk-adjustment; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> had too few patients in <b>the</b> diagnostic categories; <b>that</b> they had too few resources; {{and that they were}} not concerned with the data's public release.
