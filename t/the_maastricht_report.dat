40|$|Important {{progress}} has been made in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection and in this fifth edition of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> Consensus <b>Report,</b> key aspects related to the clinical role of H. pylori were re-evaluated in 2015. In <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> V/Florence Consensus Conference, 43 experts from 24 countries examined new data related to H. pylori in five subdivided workshops: (1) Indications/Associations, (2) Diagnosis, (3) Treatment, (4) Prevention/Public Health, (5) H. pylori and the Gastric Microbiota. The results of the individual workshops were presented to a final consensus voting that included all participants.

40|$|Management of Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} is evolving {{and in this}} 4 th edition of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> consensus <b>report</b> aspects related to the clinical role of H pylori were looked at again in 2010. In the 4 th Maastricht/Florence Consensus Conference 44 experts from 24 countries took active part and examined key clinical aspects in three subdivided workshops: (1) Indications and contraindications for diagnosis and treatment, focusing on dyspepsia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and extraintestinal manifestations of the infection. (2) Diagnostic tests and treatment of infection. (3) Prevention of gastric cancer and other complications. The results of the individual workshops were submitted to a final consensus voting to all participants. Recommendations are provided {{on the basis of}} the best current evidence and plausibility to guide doctors involved in the management of this infection associated with various clinical conditions...|$|R
50|$|Helicobacter pylori {{eradication}} protocols is {{a standard}} name for all treatment protocols for peptic ulcers and gastritis; the primary goal is not only temporary relief of symptoms, but also total elimination of Helicobacter pylori infection. Patients with active duodenal or gastric ulcers and those with a prior ulcer history should be tested for H. pylori. Appropriate therapy should be given for eradication. Patients with MALT lymphoma should also be tested and treated for H. pylori since eradication of this infection can induce remission in many patients when the tumor {{is limited to the}} stomach. Several consensus conferences, including <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> Consensus <b>Report,</b> recommend testing and treating several other groups of patients but there is limited evidence of benefit. This includes patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma (especially those with early-stage disease), patients found to have atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia, as well as first-degree relatives of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma since the relatives themselves are at increased risk of gastric cancer partly due to the intrafamilial transmission of H. pylori. To date, it remains controversial whether to test and treat all patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or other non-GI disorders as well as asymptomatic individuals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEradication of Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{has become}} an important issue recently, because this bacterial species cluster can cause many gastrointestinal diseases. Elevated antibiotic resistance is related to an increasing failure rate of H. pylori eradication. Standard triple therapy is still the first-line therapy; however, according to <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> IV Consensus <b>Report,</b> it should be abandoned in areas of high clarithromycin resistance. Alternative first-line therapies include bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, sequential, concomitant, and hybrid therapies. Quinolone-based triple therapy may be considered as first-line therapy in areas of clarithromycin resistance > 15 – 20 % and quinolone resistance < 10 %. Unique second-line therapy is still unclear, and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy or levofloxacin-based triple therapy {{can be used as}} rescue treatment. Third-line therapy should be under culture guidance to select the most effective regimens (such as levofloxacin-based, rifabutin-based, or furazolidone-based therapies). Antibiotics resistance, patient compliance, and CYP 2 C 19 genotypes could influence the outcome. Clinicians should use antibiotics according to local reports...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{evidence}} demonstrating the dramatically high incidence of H. pylori infection and the subsequent medical challenges it incurs, health management of H. pylori infection has been {{a high priority for}} health authorities worldwide. Despite a decreasing rate of infection in western countries, prevalence of H. pylori infection in developing and in some industrial countries is still very high. Whereas treatment and vaccination against H. pylori is a contemporary issue in medical communities, selective treatment and prior high-throughput screening of the subject population is a major concern of health organizations. So far, diagnostic tests are either elaborative and require relatively advanced medical care infrastructure or they do not fulfill the criteria recommended by <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> IV/Florence consensus <b>report.</b> In this review, in light of recent scientific studies, we highlight current and possible future approaches for the diagnosis of H. pylori. We point out that novel non-invasive tests may not only cover the requirements of gold standard methods in H. pylori detection but also offer the potential for risk stratification of infection in a high throughput manner...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{absorption}} {{represents an}} important factor affecting the efficacy of oral drug treatment. Gastric secretion and motility seem to be critical for drug absorption. A causal relationship between impaired absorption of orally administered drugs and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been proposed. Associations have been reported between poor bioavailability of l-thyroxine and l-dopa and H. pylori infection. According to <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> Florence Consensus <b>Report</b> on the management of H. pylori infection, H. pylori treatment improves the bioavailability of both these drugs, whereas the direct clinical benefits to patients still await to be established. Less strong seems the association between H. pylori infection and other drugs malabsorption, such as delavirdine and ketoconazole. The exact mechanisms forming {{the basis of the}} relationship between H. pylori infection and impaired drugs absorption and/or bioavailability are not fully elucidated. H. pylori infection may trigger a chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and impaired gastric acid secretion often follows. The reduction of acid secretion closely relates with the wideness and the severity of the damage and may affect drug absorption. This minireview focuses on the evidence of H. pylori infection associated with impaired drug absorption...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis analyses if {{the process}} of the fulfilment of <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> criteria between <b>the</b> years 1997 and 2007 affected the course of the global financial crisis from 2008 to 2011 in the European Union countries. States are divided into four logical groups [...] the original members of the euro zone, enlargement of the euro zone, countries with a permanent exception of joining the euro zone and the other European Union countries. The first part analyses how and which countries had been meeting <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> criteria till <b>the</b> beginning of the global financial crisis. The second part describes how fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>Maastricht</b> criteria have changed when the crisis started and how the unemployment and the growth of real GDP have changed.
