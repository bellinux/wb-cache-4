5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> because the context of <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> and thus the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E

In addition, there are three key {{differences}} between <b>the</b> Trumpet <b>judgments</b> and <b>the</b> Vial/Bowl judgments: firstly, <b>the</b> Trumpet <b>judgments</b> are plagues that bring partial devastation and plagues upon 1/3 of nature and people, while <b>the</b> Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> are more severe direct assaults against humanity and nature, thus bringing more chaos on the earth than <b>the</b> Trumpet <b>judgments.</b> Lastly, <b>the</b> Trumpet <b>judgments</b> offer a possibility of redemption and repentance, while <b>the</b> Vial <b>judgments</b> do not; <b>the</b> Vial <b>judgments</b> are a literal assault on those who have taken the mark of the Beast, and to those who are considered incorrigibles and arrogantly unrepentant, thus making them impossible to save. <b>The</b> Vial/Bowl <b>judgments</b> are listed below.|$|R

40|$|This study extends prior {{cross-cultural}} {{research by}} examining the effects of ethnic culture and organizational culture (Big 4 and non-Big 4 accounting firm affiliations) on <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of accountants in Fiji. The study also examines how interaction between ethnic culture and organizational culture influences <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of accountants. It examines the extent {{and the cause of}} differences between <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of Ethnic Fijian and Indo-Fijian accountants when interpreting and applying selected International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Consistent with their ethnic cultural values, the results show that Indo-Fijian accountants are generally more conservative in their judgments than their Ethnic Fijian counterparts. This study provides empirical evidence to support the view that both ethnic culture and organizational culture {{have a significant effect on}} the manner in which accountants within a country interpret uncertainty expressions contained in the IFRSs. The results also show that organizational culture has a greater effect on <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of accountants than ethnic culture. The results of this study provide important insights into the factors affecting <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of accountants within a country and raise interesting theoretical issues. 0 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of grammaticality of Japanese and English bitransitive {{sentences}} with a differing {{number of}} arguments. Japanese speakers exposed to Chomsky’s generative grammar (n = 30) and those not exposed (n = 28) were compared. This exposure {{was expected to}} facilitate a sentence− oriented judgment strategy that would direct speakers towards decreasing the grammaticality of the Japanese sentences lacking one or more arguments. Findings showed no effect in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of Japanese sentences. However, in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of <b>the</b> English sentences speakers exposed to generative grammar approximated to those made by native speakers of English. It was suggested that the exposure to generative grammar facilitated the sentence−oriented strategy in <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of English sentences, {{but it was not}} so effective as to weaken a discourse−oriented strategy used by Japanese speakers when they judged Japanese sentences...|$|R

In 2007, the ICTY convicted Mrkšić and Šljivančanin, but acquitted Radić. Mrkšić received a 20-year prison sentence, while Šljivančanin was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison.
