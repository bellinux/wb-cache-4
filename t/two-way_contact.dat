25|$|By 1924 many {{additional}} specially licensed amateurs {{were routinely}} making transoceanic contacts at distances of 6000 miles (~9600km) and more. On 21 September several amateurs in California completed two way contacts with an amateur in New Zealand. On 19 October amateurs in New Zealand and England completed a 90-minute <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> nearly {{halfway around the}} world. On October 10, the Third National Radio Conference made three shortwave bands available to U.S. amateurs at 80 meters (3.75MHz), 40 meters (7MHz) and 20 meters (14MHz). These were allocated worldwide, while the 10-meter band (28MHz) {{was created by the}} Washington International Radiotelegraph Conference on 25 November 1927. The 15-meter band (21MHz) was opened to amateurs in the United States on 1 May 1952.|$|E
2500|$|During a radio contest, each station {{attempts}} to establish <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> with other licensed amateur {{radio stations and}} exchange information specific to that contest. [...] The information exchanged could include a signal report, a name, the U.S. state or Canadian province in which the station is located, the geographic zone in which the station is located, the Maidenhead grid locator in which the station is located, {{the age of the}} operator, or an incrementing serial number. [...] For each contact, the radio operator must correctly receive the call sign of the other station, as well as the information in the [...] "exchange", and record this data, along with the time of the contact and the band or frequency that was used to make the contact, in a log.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complement}} the burst of activity and interest being generated in DX communications by {{the popularity of}} the International Relay Parties, the ARRL adopted a competitive operating format for events designed for non-international contacts. [...] The first ARRL All-Sections Sweepstakes Contest was started in 1930. [...] The Sweepstakes required a more complicated exchange of information for each <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> that was adapted from the message header structure used by the National Traffic System. [...] The competition was immediately popular, both with those operators active in the NTS who participated as an opportunity to gauge the merits of their station and operating skills, and among those for whom the competitive excitement of the event was the primary attraction. [...] The contest, sponsored annually by the ARRL, became known as the ARRL November Sweepstakes in 1962.|$|E
50|$|A captive rover is a rover station whose contest {{operation}} is intended specifically or {{primarily for the}} benefit of another fixed station. A captive rover might travel to locations in several different grid locators and make <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> only with one specific multi-operator station in the contest. That station benefits from the activity of the rover station, whereas its competition in the contest cannot receive the same potential benefit. A fixed station that is helped by multiple captive rovers can generate a very large score making <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> with only a small set of rovers.|$|R
25|$|Limited amateur radio {{operations}} have occurred, using moon bounce or Earth–Moon–Earth communication, in which radio signals {{aimed at the}} Moon are reflected back to Earth. The first of these operations was on June 13–14, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> were made on 144 and 432MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432MHz during the limited time slots available. For these tests, a very wide-band instrumentation recorder captured {{a large segment of}} the receiving bandwidth, enabling later verification of other amateur station callsigns. These were not <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts.</b> From April 16–18, 2010, again, the Arecibo Amateur Radio Club KP4AO conducted moon-bounce activity using the antenna.|$|R
50|$|As of January 2014, Clublog listed Amsterdam and St Paul Islands as {{the seventh}} most-wanted DXCC entity. On 25 January 2014 a DX-pedition landed on Amsterdam Island using M/V Braveheart and began amateur radio {{operations}} from two separate locations using callsign FT5ZM. The DX-pedition remained active until 12 February 2014 and achieved over 170,000 <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> with amateur radio stations worldwide.|$|R
2500|$|The Pileup Trainer Test simulates a [...] "pileup" [...] {{situation}} in on-air amateur radio operating where numerous stations {{are attempting to}} establish <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> with one particular station at the same time. [...] This competition uses a software program called MorseRunner. [...] In the MorseRunner software, more than one amateur radio call sign is sent at a time. [...] Each call sign is sent in Morse code generated at different audio frequencies and speeds, timed to overlap each other. [...] Competitors must record {{as many of the}} call signs as they can during a fixed period of time. [...] They may choose to do this either by recording the call signs by hand on paper, or by typing them in with a computer keyboard. [...] The winner is the competitor with the most correctly recorded call signs.|$|E
5000|$|Specialty {{awards are}} {{available}} for establishing <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> with stations in all 40 zones using certain transmission modes including: CW, AM, SSB, amateur radio satellites, Radioteletype (RTTY), a digital mode other than RTTY, or Slow-scan television (SSTV).|$|E
50|$|The {{world record}} {{distance}} for a <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand. As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer-controlled Morse code (QRSS) or specialized digital communications modes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the awards described above, a five-band WAC award is available. The award is given to amateur radio operators who successfully complete and confirm <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> {{with each of the}} six continents on five amateur radio bands (the 80-meter, 40-meter, 20-meter, 15-meter, and 10-meter bands). There is also a six-band endorsement available for this award, with 160-meters usually the additional one.|$|R

500|$|Vintage {{operating}} {{activity is}} not limited to the AM mode. Many devotees use their [...] "classic" [...] amateur gear from vintage-era American manufacturers like Eico, EF Johnson, National, Heathkit, Hammarlund, Drake, Collins, WRL, Swan, Signal/One, Lafayette and Hallicrafters, to make radiotelegraphy (CW), SSB, FM and RTTY <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts.</b> Although 1930s through 1970s gear is considered [...] "vintage", collectors may differ on the cutoff dates.|$|R
50|$|The mid-symbol {{listening}} and interruption capability {{provided by the}} short but ubiquitous Morse code silent periods during QSK or full break-in operation on half-duplex radiotelegraph channels creates the illusion of apparent continuous <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> allowing radiotelegraph operators {{to feel as if}} they are sharing a full duplex channel.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the awards described above, a 5-Band WAS award is available. 5BWAS, as it is known, is awarded to amateur radio operators who successfully complete <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> {{with each of the}} fifty United States on five amateur radio bands in the high frequency radio spectrum, specifically the 80-, 40-, 20-, 15-, and 10-meter bands. There are no band or mode endorsements associated with 5BWAS.|$|E
50|$|The 1920s saw {{tremendous}} technical {{growth in}} radio. Pushed both by wartime demands {{and by the}} growing commercialization of radio, equipment rapidly improved. The use of spark gap technology quickly disappeared as the more efficient continuous wave system of generating radio-frequency energy and transmitting Morse Code became standard. In 1923 a <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> between Connecticut and France bridged the Atlantic Ocean for the first time.|$|E
50|$|In North American VHF radio contests, rover {{stations}} {{are those that}} travel from one Maidenhead grid locator to another. The rules of major VHF contests allow these stations to make <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> with other stations from each unique grid locator in which they travel. Rover activity is responsible for contest operations from many grid locators that might otherwise not have any active contest stations.|$|R

50|$|Specialty {{awards are}} {{available}} for establishing <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> with stations in all 50 states using amateur radio satellites, Radioteletype (RTTY), or Slow-scan television (SSTV). Specialty awards are also available for contacts entirely on specific amateur radio bands: (144 MHz, 432 MHz, 222 MHz, 50 MHz, or 160 meters) and for using a digital mode other than RTTY. Each of these specialty awards is numbered individually.|$|E
50|$|After {{this reality}} check, the senior {{executives}} review the facts. A neutrino transmission is {{an advanced method}} of communication which can cover billions of miles in an instant. A neutrino beam from Earth focused on the Moon could provide this miraculous <b>two-way</b> <b>contact.</b> Theoretical experiments had just begun in 1999. As their years in space would translate into the passage of decades on Earth, {{there would have been}} ample time for research and development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} sending a post card to verify {{reception}} of a station (and later <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> between them) {{may have been}} independently invented several times. The earliest reference {{seems to be a}} card sent in 1916 from 8VX in Buffalo, New York to 3TQ in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (in those days ITU prefixes were not used). The standardized card with callsign, frequency, date, etc. may have been developed in 1919 by C.D. Hoffman, 8UX, in Akron, Ohio. In Europe, W.E.F. [...] "Bill" [...] Corsham, 2UV, first used a QSL when operating from Harlesden, England in 1922.|$|E
50|$|Endorsement {{stickers}} can {{be earned}} {{on both the}} basic and specialty awards. Endorsement categories are CW, US Novice class, QRP, Packet, EME, any single amateur radio band, and for specific digital modes (e.g. PSK31, JT65, Olivia). Endorsements also require submission of written proof of <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> with stations located {{in each of the}} 50 United States of America using the mode or band for which the endorsement is offered.|$|R
50|$|Most {{contests}} {{prohibit the}} use of non-radio means to solicit contacts during the contest period. This does not prevent stations before a contest starts from making schedules (or skeds) with other stations to attempt <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> during the contest. These schedules are often made for attempts at marginal propagation paths, or contacts over great distance, and are often made {{during the middle of}} the night when other contest activity is low.|$|R
2500|$|The {{origin of}} contesting {{can be traced}} to the Trans-Atlantic Tests of the early 1920s, when amateur radio {{operators}} first attempted to establish long distance radiocommunications across the Atlantic Ocean on the short wave amateur radio frequencies. [...] Even after the first two-way communications between North America and Europe were established in 1923, these tests continued to be annual events at which more and more stations were successful in establishing <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> over greater and greater distances. [...] In 1927, the American Radio Relay League, which had been principal in organizing and publicizing these tests, proposed a new format for the annual event, encouraging stations to make as many <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> with stations in other countries as possible. [...] The 1928 International Relay Party, as the event was renamed, was the first organized amateur radio contest. [...] The International Relay Party was an immediate success, and was sponsored annually by the ARRL from 1927 through 1935. [...] In 1936, the contest name changed to the ARRL International DX Contest, the name under which it is known today.|$|R
50|$|Linquist taxied NC16002 {{to the end}} of runway 27 for takeoff, {{but stopped}} {{at the end of the}} apron due to lack of two-way radio communication. Though capable of receiving, Linquist {{reported}} to the head of Puerto Rican Transport, who had driven out to the aircraft, that the radio could not transmit because of the low batteries. After agreeing to stay close to San Juan until they were recharged enough to allow <b>two-way</b> <b>contact,</b> NC16002 finally lifted off at 22:03. After circling the city for 11 minutes, Linquist received confirmation from CAA at San Juan and told the tower that they were proceeding to Miami on a previous flight plan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{practice}} of DXing arose {{during the early}} days of radio broadcasting. Listeners would mail [...] "reception reports" [...] to radio broadcasting stations in hopes of getting a written acknowledgement or a QSL card that served to officially verify they had heard a distant station. Collecting these cards became popular with radio listeners in the 1920s and 1930s, and reception reports were often used by early broadcasters to gauge the effectiveness of their transmissions. Although international shortwave broadcasts are on the decline, DXing remains popular among dedicated shortwave listeners. The pursuit of <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> between distant amateur radio operators is also a significant activity within the amateur radio hobby.|$|E

50|$|In 1921, a {{challenge}} was issued by American hams to {{their counterparts in}} the United Kingdom to receive radio contacts from across the Atlantic. Soon, many American stations were beginning to be heard in the UK, shortly followed by a UK amateur being heard in the US in December 1922. November 27, 1923 marked the first transatlantic <b>two-way</b> <b>contact</b> between American amateur Fred Schnell and French amateur Léon Deloy. Shortly after, the first two way contact between the UK and USA was in December 1923, between London and West Hartford, Connecticut. In the following months 17 American and 13 European amateur stations were communicating. Within the next year, communications between North and South America; South America and New Zealand; North America and New Zealand; and London and New Zealand were being made.|$|E

50|$|CPC: Cost per click {{tracks the}} cost of {{interacting}} with a client or potential client. In traditional marketing, CPC {{is viewed as a}} one-way process of reaching target audiences through means such as direct mail, radio ads and television ads. Search advertising provides opportunities for <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts</b> through web-based chat, Internet-based calls, call-back requests or mailing list sign-ups. There are some guidelines to establish minimum acceptable counting procedure for clicks. Each and every click has a life cycle which is known as click referral cycle.

2500|$|In 1911 {{the first}} trials with radio {{communication}} were made after a return flight from Farnborough to Portsmouth. [...] Although <b>two-way</b> radio <b>contact</b> was established, practical communication was made difficult by {{the noise of}} the engine.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} widely used contesting {{technologies}} is computer-generated CW. Most contest logging software packages support the use of a parallel port or serial port interface that connects to the keying input on amateur radio transceivers for sending Morse code. Some interfaces also include an input for a telegraph key. CW can be generated from text typed on the computer keyboard, from a telegraph key, or from memories in the computer associated with steps in the process of making contest contacts. Some software can use databases of additional information about other amateur radio stations on the air to include personalized greetings during <b>two-way</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|R
