5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to work.|$|E
5|$|After a drawn first Test {{the second}} match {{was a game}} of two halves. England {{developed}} a 233 run lead at the half way stage and had the West Indies on 204/5 when Butcher was caught. This dismissal caused a riot and from this point onwards England struggled with the spin bowling of Sobers and Gibbs, narrowly avoiding defeat by two wickets. The third Test saw another drawn match due to the slow batting of the West Indies, taking over two days to score 349 runs which included a spell of four runs in one hour. England took a 1–0 lead after the fourth Test, in a game <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> least like winning. The win was mainly due to Sobers' decision to declare on 92/2 in the West Indies second innings. Good batting by Alan Knott and a 127 sixth wicket partnership ensured the final game ended in a draw as England maintained their 1–0 lead to win the series.|$|E

25|$|The KP3T {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} political {{figures from the}} previous regime, including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto. The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found {{that there had been}} no systematic massacre in the incident. This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white Islamic clothing and green scarves. They broke windows with stones and rattan sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces. The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished. Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Human Rights Yusril Ihza Mahendra wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; he said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident then they had been in investigating the 1999 East Timorese crisis. Crescent Star Party leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere.|$|E
25|$|Konoe's {{terms for}} making peace were so extreme and harsh {{that even the}} Japanese {{military}} objected to them, {{on the grounds that}} Chiang would never accept peace with them. The German Foreign Minister, Konstantin von Neurath, who was attempting to mediate a compromise peace between China and Japan as the Reich, which had friendly relations with Japan and China did not wish to choose between the two, complained, upon seeing Konoe's peace terms, that these were so intentionally outrageous and humiliating demands <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to be designed only to inspire rejection on Chiang's part. Konoe's main demands were that China recognise Manchukuo, sign the Anti-Comintern Pact, allow Japanese officers to command the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, allow Japanese troops to remain indefinitely in all the areas of China they had occupied, and pay reparations to Japan. China was not only to pay the entire costs of the war run up by Japan but also a punitive amount so that the Chinese people might reflect on the folly of seeking to challenge the might of Japan.|$|E

500|$|Jeanne Marecek gave Sexual Preference a {{negative}} review in Sex Roles, writing {{that it was}} tedious and succeeded well neither as a popular book nor as a scientific treatment of its topic. She maintained that it lacked [...] "methodological detail", and that its true focus was homosexuality rather than sexual preference generally. She believed {{that there were many}} problems with [...] "the premises and the execution" [...] of Bell et al.′s study, writing that they neither broke [...] "new theoretical ground" [...] nor offered [...] "a critical reading of old theories" [...] and ignored questions such as [...] "how and why adults change their sexual preference, what meanings individuals ascribe to their sexuality, and how social context contributes to stability or change in sexual preference". In her view, other problems included Bell et al.′s failure to critically examine [...] "the accuracy of the retrospective memories" [...] of their respondents and willingness to take their answers to questions at face value. Marecek concluded that they must have been disappointed by the results of their path analyses since, [...] "Very few of the respondents' reported early experiences were related to the emergence of homosexuality." [...] She disagreed with Bell et al.′s focus on theories relating homosexuality to childhood experience and their conclusion that [...] "sexual preference is dictated by developmental experiences", and wrote <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> politically conservative despite presenting themselves as liberals.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, DC Comics {{acquired}} {{a line of}} characters from Charlton Comics. During that period, writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp, {{as he had done}} in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s. Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project, so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour. The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used, as long as readers recognized them [...] "so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was". Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker, and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano. Giordano was receptive to the proposal, but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story. Moore said, [...] "DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional." [...] Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters. Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers, but later changed his mind. He said, [...] "Eventually, I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> familiar in certain ways, certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super-hero resonance or familiarity to the reader, then it might work." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence and Frieda {{returned}} to Britain in 1913 {{for a short}} visit, during which they encountered and befriended critic John Middleton Murry and New Zealand-born short story writer Katherine Mansfield.

Davies collected autographs, and was particularly keen to obtain Lawrence's. Georgian poetry publisher Edward Marsh was able to secure an autograph (probably {{as part of a}} signed poem), and invited Lawrence and Frieda to meet Davies in London on 28 July, under his supervision.

2500|$|The first {{sightings}} {{occurred in}} November 1944, when pilots flying over Western Europe by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange.

Pilots and aircrew {{reported that the}} objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved {{as if they were}} under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name – in the European Theater of Operations they were often called [...] "Kraut fireballs", {{but for the most part}} called [...] "foo-fighters".

2500|$|Reasons as to {{why they}} decided to obtain {{partnership}} with the Amazonian region was for multiple reasons. One of the reasons was that the location was ideal. Two of the most high quality rubber trees grew in that region; the Hevea tree and the Castilloa. [...] tree the Hevea tree was only able to be used 6 month out of the year while the Castilloa was able to be used the whole year. To begin the trading system, the Western territories began to obtain discourse with the Mestizos of the land which were known to be the more prestigious of the different groups residing in Ecuador. They became highly tied into the trading system that was created. There was fast money involved in this system that attracted the Mestizos. Economic prosperity seemed promising. As the rubber industry flourished many other factors came to surface in the system of Rubber production. Because of the high demand for rubber at the time, the Mestizos who became known as the Caucheros (rubber barons) decided that they needed to obtain an abundant amount of workers that would work for low wages. The indigenous population soon came to mind because of a couple of factors. One was due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> the best fit to perform the labor. They knew the lands to which they would work on because of their long history of them living on the land. They were well adapted to the climate and [...] was familiar with the means of survival like hunting and gathering. The enslavement of the Indigenous people soon became an epidemic. Natives were taken from their homes by a group called the Muchachos who were African men hired by the Caucheros to do their dirty work. They were in turn forced to work in the rubber industries by fear and intimidation and were put on a rubber quota in relation to a certain time period and were expected to meet the demands.|$|E
