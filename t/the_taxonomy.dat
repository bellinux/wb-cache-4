40|$|Mining {{generalized}} association rules among {{items in}} <b>the</b> presence of <b>taxonomies</b> {{has been recognized}} as an important model for data mining. Earlier work on mining generalized association rules, however, required <b>the</b> <b>taxonomies</b> to be static, ignoring the fact that <b>the</b> <b>taxonomies</b> of items cannot necessarily be kept unchanged. For instance, some items may be reclassified from one hierarchy tree to another for more suitable classification, abandoned from <b>the</b> <b>taxonomies</b> if they {{will no longer be}} produced, or added into <b>the</b> <b>taxonomies</b> as new items. Additionally, the analysts might have to dynamically adjust <b>the</b> <b>taxonomies</b> from different viewpoints so as to discover more informative rules. Under these circumstances, effectively updating the discovered generalized association rules is a crucial task. In this paper, we examine this problem and propose two novel algorithms, called Diff_ET and Diff_ET 2, to update the discovered frequent itemsets. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are very effective and have good linear scale-up characteristics. 2 Keywords: Data mining, generalized association rules, frequent itemsets, evolving taxonomies. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{integrating}} objects from a source taxonomy into a master taxonomy. This problem is not only currently pervasive on the web, but also important to the emerging semantic web. A straightforward approach to automating this process would be to learn a classifier that can classify objects from <b>the</b> source <b>taxonomy</b> into categories of <b>the</b> master <b>taxonomy.</b> <b>The</b> key insight is that the availability of <b>the</b> source <b>taxonomy</b> data could be helpful to build better classifiers for <b>the</b> master <b>taxonomy</b> if their categorizations have some semantic overlap.

5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory.

5|$|The genus {{was named}} in 1825 by English {{geologist}} Gideon Mantell, based on fossil specimens {{that are now}} assigned to Therosaurus and Mantellodon.

Together with Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus, {{it was one of the}} three genera originally used to define Dinosauria. The genus Iguanodon belongs to the larger group Iguanodontia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs. <b>The</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of the {{albatross}} {{group has}} been a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. The albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E
