50|$|Scheduled {{services}} to Glasgow were introduced with a Short 330 aircraft after the previous operator, Metropolitan Airways, had ceased trading. The SH330 was later {{returned to its}} leasing company and the scheduled routes to Oslo and Frankfurt were discontinued. The sole Gulfstream 1 was then operated on a regular Leeds-Glasgow-Leeds-Cardiff service, introducing the first direct services from Leeds to Cardiff and a <b>through-flight</b> from Glasgow to Cardiff. The Gulfstream 1 proved a popular aircraft and operated 50 sectors {{a week for a}} full year with a 100% dispatch record. The aircraft soon became too small to service demand and it was then the airline re-branded as Capital Airlines and took delivery of its first Short 360-300 G-BNDM, which was the first airline to operate the Short 360 configured with 39 seats.|$|E
5000|$|Russell Clifford Durant (called [...] "Cliff" [...] by his friends) was a {{race car}} driver, {{speedboat}} enthusiast, amateur flier, President of Durant Motors in Oakland, and son of General Motors founder William [...] "Billy" [...] Crapo Durant. In 1916, he established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street. The first experimental transcontinental airmail <b>through-flight</b> finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, with Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta (pictured right) at the controls of the Junkers F 13 re-badged as the model J.L.6. The airfield served only secondary duties after 1927, as its runway was not long enough for heavily loaded aircraft. In April 1930, test pilot Herbert [...] "Hub" [...] Fahy and his wife Claire hit a stump upon landing, flipping their plane and mortally wounding Hub without injuring Claire. Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles (4 mi) southwest.|$|E
