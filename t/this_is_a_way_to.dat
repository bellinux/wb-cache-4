25|$|Pantothenic acid {{is used in}} the {{synthesis}} of coenzyme A (CoA). Coenzyme A may act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also important in the biosynthesis of many important compounds such as fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. CoA is incidentally also required in the formation of ACP, which is also required for fatty acid synthesis in addition to CoA.|$|E
25|$|Many newspapers, besides {{employing}} journalists {{on their}} own payrolls, also subscribe to news agencies (wire services) (such as the Associated Press, Reuters, or Agence France-Presse), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the content to the various newspapers. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55million copies). The late 2000s–early 2010s global recession, combined with {{the rapid growth of}} free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses. Worldwide annual revenue approached $100billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{problems}} with this interpretation, however. [...] The chariot {{is not one of}} victory. [...] It would be unusual for a two-horse chariot to be used for the triumph. [...] Also, Tiberius wears the toga. [...] The toga represents civility and peace, not war. [...] Perhaps <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> hand the victory to Augustus’ auguries. [...] Tiberius steps down from the chariot, doing obeisance to Augustus, giving his adoptive parent the triumph and victory. [...] If all this is true, then figure #8 could still be one of two persons, Drusus or Germanicus. [...] By this age, Drusus was probably already dead, having fallen from his horse and suffered irreparable injuries. [...] It could be, then, a representation of Drusus, and his memory, since he was fondly regarded by almost all. [...] Since he is clad in fighting garb, the helmet probably beside him under the chariot, and coincidentally standing next to a horse, this could very well be Drusus. [...] In addition, there are three constellations relating to the three portraits. [...] Drusus would claim Gemini, though the Gemini is quite covert. [...] If the portrait represented Drusus as alive, however, the gem would have been made {{about the same time as}} the Ara Pacis and the Altar of Augustus, sometime before 9 B.C., the year of Drusus’ death.|$|E
