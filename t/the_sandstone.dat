5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; <b>the</b> <b>sandstone</b> was mostly quarried at Howick. <b>The</b> <b>sandstone</b> has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and <b>the</b> <b>sandstone</b> along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Operation Sandstone was {{a series}} of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, {{following}} Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, <b>the</b> <b>Sandstone</b> tests were carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Sandstone</b> tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three tests were carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.|$|E
30|$|The {{connected}} porosity of <b>the</b> <b>sandstones</b> {{is between}} 0.04 [*]<[*]ϕc[*]<[*] 0.15; the isolated porosity does not exceed 0.02.

5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. <b>The</b> <b>sandstone</b> at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the behavior of}} Segou <b>sandstones</b> in <b>the</b> laboratory and in the field conditions. Four types of sandstone are collected {{in the northern part}} of the Madina Kouta basin (eastern Senegal). These types of specimens are <b>the</b> white <b>sandstones,</b> <b>the</b> red <b>sandstones,</b> <b>the</b> purple <b>sandstones</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sandstones</b> with intercalation of pelites. Uniaxial tests are carried out on these specimens of <b>sandstones.</b> <b>The</b> Young Moduli (E) and the Uniaxial Compression Strengths (Rc) are higher for <b>the</b> white <b>sandstone.</b> Values of <b>the</b> mechanical parameters decrease slightly for red sandstones due to an increase of the amount of pelites in the composition of the rock. Decrease of mechanical parameters is more important for the purple facies due to an important network of fractures. The facies with weaker characteristics corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>sandstones</b> with intercalation of pelites. This is due to the soft nature of the pelites. The slope stability of the Cliff sides depends also on to these characteristics...|$|R

5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead.

50|$|The maximum {{thickness}} of the sediments at Dalarna is 800 m. The lowermost sediments are conglomerates and breccias. Above this basal layer, sediments are mainly stratified red sandstone intercalated with shale and conglomerate. Among <b>the</b> <b>sandstones</b> there are greywacke sandstones and quartz-rich sandstones. A remarkable feature on <b>the</b> Dala <b>sandstones</b> is that delicate features like ripple marks, rain drop marks and mudcracks have survived in <b>the</b> sediments. <b>The</b> <b>sandstones</b> in Dalarna are of aeolian origin and represent ancient dunes and interdune sediments. <b>The</b> Dala <b>sandstone</b> has an imprint of low grade burial metamorphism of the pumpellyite type, meaning they must once have been buried beneath several kilometres of sediments. It is possible that <b>the</b> Dala <b>sandstone</b> was once connected to the Gulf of Bothnia by an epicontinental sea. <b>The</b> Dala <b>sandstone</b> constitute a part of broad north-south aligned syncline.
