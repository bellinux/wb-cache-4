In 1985, they released their debut album, I Get Hot, which included tracks whose vocals drew strong comparisons to Sean and Gerald Leverts father Eddie.

However, the bands next album, 1987s The Big Throwdown became an even bigger success, on the strength of the Number One R&B hit [...] "Casanova", which gave them a crossover hit on the pop chart (number 5) and also a UK Top 10. A pair of additional R&B Top Five singles were also released from this album: [...] "My Forever Love" [...] and [...] "Sweet Sensation". The bands success continued with their 1988 follow-up album Just Coolin, which was nominated for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary Album for the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. Both The Big Throwdown and Just Coolin received gold certification. Beginning in the 1990s, Gerald began dividing his time between LeVert, and his solo career, but the band went on to release three more albums, and Rhino Records released a greatest hits album in 2001.|$|E
