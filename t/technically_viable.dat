5000|$|Years later, Trull {{reflected}} on the lessons she learned working on Let It Be Known. The intention of the LP was to produce it with all women, but {{to make it more}} <b>technically</b> <b>viable</b> than previous Olivia recordings. She described the recording as a [...] "total financial bomb" [...] and a [...] "big nightmare" [...] to make, because of the desire to use women musicians who may not have the studio experience to give the producer what they want in an efficient manner, which increased the costs of the recording process. While Trull did not produce Let It Be Known, she remembered the experiences later in her career when she was responsible for the finances of other recordings.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{analyze the}} ease and {{surgical}} outcome of using sutureless transconjunctival approach for repair of infra-orbital fractures. Design: Prospective clinical case series. Materials and Methods: Totally 5 patients with infra-orbital rim or orbital floor fractures were selected and the fractures were accessed through a pre-septal transconjunctival incision. After reduction and fixation, the conjunctiva was just re-approximated and re-draped into position. Incidence of post-operative complications such as diplopia, lid retraction, eyelid dystopia, foreign body granuloma and poor conjunctival healing was assessed at intervals of 1 week, 15 days {{and a month}} post-operatively. Results: No complications were observed {{in any of the}} 5 patients. Healing was satisfactory in all patients. Conclusion: The sutureless technique appears to be a time saving and <b>technically</b> simpler <b>viable</b> alternative to multilayered suturing in orbital trauma with minimal post-operative complications...|$|R

50|$|Future {{versions}} of the Orbital Space Plane would have been launched on an existing Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) rocket to carry crews to the International Space Station. It was envisaged that the OSP would operate alongside the Space Shuttle with the OSP responsible for crew flights and the shuttle handling construction and cargo flights. At the time, the shuttle program was not yet set for retirement and {{was thought to be}} <b>technically</b> <b>viable</b> up until the 2030s. Thus it was expected that the two spacecraft would complement each other throughout the lifespan of the ISS. One advantage of this approach would have been assured manned access to space; the lack of this capability was to be highlighted starkly with the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} major roadblocks {{to the process}} of {{recognising}} core labour standards within the WTO. Firstly, incorporating labour rights into the WTO is not simply a question of law and economics, but also of politics and ethics. Interplay between states and interest groups cloud the already complex issue further. Recognising human rights and specifically core labour standards in the WTO raises a series of thorny political, and in some cases moral, questions. Because each state is acting primarily according to its national interest, even <b>technically</b> <b>viable</b> solutions that could benefit the majority may become politicised. The highly democratic nature of the WTO compounds this problem because consensus needs to be reached before any major decisions are made, meaning each country effectively carries the power of veto, sometimes making it difficult to achieve real progress.|$|E
50|$|Estéreo Lluvia {{has been}} {{broadcasting}} {{in one form}} or another since 2002, initially on 103.5 MHz. Its founders had previously hosted shows at XEJAM in Santiago Jamiltepec. The name for the station came from a contest; the winning entry drew from the fact that the Mixtec people are known as the pueblo de la lluvia (People of the Rain). Attempts to obtain a permit legally were met by denials alleging a radio station could not be economically or <b>technically</b> <b>viable,</b> and when a legal action was turned away, Estéreo Lluvia began unlicensed operations. Operating in this manner exposed the station to potential raids by federal police. The first came either in 2002 or 2003 and saw members of the Federal Police break down the door to the municipal government offices in order to seize the station's assets. By April 2004, the station was back on air, broadcasting from a new building; additionally, a civil association had been set up to hold the station's assets.|$|E

50|$|Desjardins, who {{was born}} in France, came to Canada in 1792. Following his arrival he worked in several locations, from 1812 serving as a clerk for Richard Hatt while Hatt was away campaigning. He held this {{position}} until Hatt’s death in 1819, then becoming a partner with William Lyon Mackenzie in a warehouse on the bank of Spencer Creek. Desjardins saw the considerable benefits possible if access from the lake to Dundas were improved. He was primarily interested in developing a canal between his property and Burlington Bay but also promoted related schemes, including a second canal (never built) extending from the Desjardins Canal in Dundas to Lake Huron. The proposal would have allowed the Desjardins Canal a direct water access to the western areas of both Canada and the United States and might have proved financially attractive, if <b>technically</b> <b>viable.</b> However, by this time the Erie Canal was completed and the Welland Canal was well on its way so undoubtedly the competition was seen to be too great, considering the late start.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this {{present study was to}} evaluate the productive performance and carcass traits of kids goats receiving rations containing four ratios of concentrate and roughage using the Elephant grass in natura chopped as roughage. The ratios evaluated were: 80 : 20; 60 : 40; 40 : 60 and 20 : 80 % of concentrate and roughage in dry matter basis of rations. Twenty eight Saanen male goats with 9. 3 kg of initial body weight distributed in four groups with seven animals in collective pens were used.
