5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> name a record, {{you have}} to choose {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
500|$|The win {{marked the}} second time in {{franchise}} history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> talk to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
500|$|The studio {{introduced}} a viral marketing website {{operated by the}} Institute for Human Continuity, where filmgoers could register for a lottery number {{to be part of}} a small population which would be rescued from the global destruction. David Morrison of NASA, who received over 1,000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine, condemned it. [...] "I've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don't want to see the world end", Morrison said. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck, that is ethically wrong."

500|$|Meanwhile, Kennedy {{sat down}} for an {{interview}} with entertainer Jack Paar. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think {{that is going to be}} my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did you <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour.

I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some celebrities opposed Davis' {{decision}} {{to continue on}} the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body {{was still in the}} building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: [...] "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [...] Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: [...] "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on.

I'm not interested in being in that environment and I <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you.

2500|$|In 2006 {{the book}} was {{displayed}} in [...] "Joan Miró, Illustrated Books" [...] at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is [...] "an especially powerful set, {{not only for the}} rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Miró's familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture." [...] The critic continued, [...] "I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Miró's work. Their poignancy is even greater, I <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, Miró set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop. [...] "Citizen Kane" [...] is also referenced in the script with the line [...] "People will think what I tell them to <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tell me what to tell them to think!"
