40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{his article}} {{in this issue of}} Review of Educational Research, Dr. R. B. Zajonc takes issue with my review (1985) of the extant {{literature}} on the intellectual consequences of sibship size and birth order. He claims that <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>review</b> that was promised is not delivered. Here I respond to his main criticisms. I show that his remarks do not really alter the conclusions that one would derive from a synthesis of the research that has been conducted on this topic. Zajonc's rejoinder to my position is welcomed with enthusiasm because it provides a forum to clarify further the important issues that continue to cloud this area of inquiry. Overall, Zaj one's comments merely testify to one of the chief themes conveyed in my review: that neither side in this spirited debate appears to profit from or build on the observations of the other. This regrettable practice has thwarted potential theoretical advancements. Offered at the close of this rebuttal are suggestions to synthesize the disparate views of the influence of sibling config-uration on intellectual performance. A brief recap of the main findings of my pape...|$|E

30|$|In {{an online}} marketplace, buyers {{rely heavily on}} reviews posted by {{previous}} buyers (referred to as advisors). The advisor’s credibility determines the persuasiveness of reviews. Much work has addressed the evaluation of advisors’ credibility based on their static profile information, but {{little attention has been}} paid to the effect of the information about the history of advisors’ reviews. We conducted three sub-studies to evaluate how <b>the</b> advisors’ <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> (proportion of positive reviews) affects the buyer’s judgement of advisor’s credibility (e.g., trustworthiness, expertise). The result of study 1 shows that advisors with mixed positive and negative reviews are perceived to be more trustworthy, and those with extremely positive or negative <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> are perceived to be less trustworthy. Moreover, the perceived expertise of the advisor increases as <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> turns from positive to negative; yet buyers perceive advisors with extremely negative <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> as low in expertise. Study 2 finds that buyers might be more inclined to misattribute low trustworthiness to low expertise when they are processing high number of reviews. Finally, study 3 explains the misattribution phenomenon and suggests that perceived expertise has close relationship with affective trust. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.|$|R

40|$|Many {{debates about}} {{surveillance}} at work are {{framed by a}} set of a priori assumptions {{about the nature of the}} employment relationship that inhibits efforts to understand the complexity of employee responses to the spread of new technology at work. In particular, the debate about the prevalence of resistance is hamstrung from the outset by the assumption that all apparently non-compliant acts, whether intentional or not, are to be counted as acts of resistance. Against this background this paper seeks to redress <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> by <b>reviewing</b> results from an ethnographic study of surveillance-capable technologies in a number of British workplaces. It argues for greater attention to be paid to the empirical character of the social relations at work in and through which technologies are deployed and in the context of which employee responses are played out...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we segment advisors {{into five}} types {{based on the}} ratio of {{positive}} to negative reviews (referred to as <b>review</b> <b>balance).</b> If <b>the</b> proportion of positive (negative) reviews is extremely higher than, substantially higher than, or almost equal to the proportion of negative (positive) <b>reviews,</b> <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> is respectively defined as extreme positive (negative), positive (negative), or neutral. We choose <b>review</b> <b>balance</b> as representative of review history {{because it can be}} easily noticed by buyers through direct scanning of an advisor’s review history list or a summary table provided by the platform. Prior studies indicate that buyers usually do not scrutinize reviews [13, 14]; they form attitude only based on the information they gain easily. Intuition also suggests that it is unrealistic for a buyer to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of review history for each advisor in the product page.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard {{has become}} vital for {{companies}} {{in order to}} ensure a competitive advantage in our ever changing global environment. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard, if applied effectively, will assess whether the company’s vision, mission, strategy and values are achieved. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard system is a management tool {{that can be used to}} transform strategy into action. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard used at Picture Perfect Photography has been identified as problematic. This study includes a literature study on <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard system and an empirical study regarding the application of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard in a specific Photography company. The literature study set out to evaluate the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard as it is applied at Picture Perfect Photography. The secondary objectives defined <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard, <b>reviewed</b> <b>the</b> evolution and the need for a <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard. <b>The</b> literature study further explored the advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard and continued exploring personal development with linking it to compensation. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard should be used to align the company’s vision and strategy in order to improve long-term performance. The research indicates that communication and constant feedback play an important role in the successful implementation of a <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard approach. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard could be a very useful instrument when implemented and applied effectively. An empirical study was done including Picture Perfect Photography’s employees, at different job levels, work sections and years of service. The aim of the empirical study was to determine how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard was used in the alignment with the company’s strategy, vision, mission and values. Furthermore, the aim was to determine the problems with <b>the</b> existing <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard and if it helps to focus on quality, reengineering and customer services’ initiatives. The study indicated more or less the same average responses on specific Balanced Scorecard related issues.

40|$|A decade ago, Newhouse (1987) {{assessed}} <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> {{of trade}} between imports from the econometrics literature into health economics, and exports from health economics {{to a wider}} audience. While it is undoubtedly true that imports of concepts and techniques still dominate <b>the</b> <b>balance,</b> <b>the</b> literature <b>reviewed</b> in this chapter shows that the range and volume of applied econometric work in health economics has increased dramatically {{over the past ten}} years. Examples of good practice in health econometrics make extensive use of tests for misspecification and explicit model selection criteria. Robust and distribution-free estimators are of increasing importance, and the chapter gives examples of nonparametric, and semiparametric estimators applied to sample selection, simultaneous equations, count data, and survival models. Published replications of empirical results remain relatively rare. One way in which this deficit may be remedied is through the appearance of more systematic reviews of econometric studies. The use of experimental data remains an exception and most applied studies continue to rely on observational data from secondary sources. However applied work in health economics is likely to be influenced by the debate concerning the use of data from social experiments. The chapter illustrates the impressive diversity of applied econometric work over the past decade. Most of the studies reviewed here use individual level data and this has led to the use {{of a wide range of}} nonlinear models, including qualitative and limited dependent variables, along with count, survival and frontier models. Because of the widespread use of observational data, particular attention has gone into dealing with problems of self-selection and heterogeneity bias. This is likely to continue in the future, with the emphasis on robust estimators applied to longitudinal and other complex datasets. ...|$|R
40|$|As the British {{government}} embarks {{upon the}} process of exiting the European Union (EU), {{it will have to}} navigate the preferences of powerful business interest groups. However, the British politics and political economy literatures have tended to neglect the question of business agency in general and its relation to EU integration in particular.

Through a document analysis of business responses to <b>the</b> <b>Balance</b> of Competences <b>Review</b> on EU Employment Policy and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) policy documents, the article argues that British business has attempted to ‘defend and extend’ a liberalising agenda within the EU in the recent past.

The review covers several substantive areas of EU competence and is divided into four semesters. This submission has been written in response to the Call for Evidence in relation to tax matters, which was issued by the HM Treasury in November 2012 (Semester 1). The analysis draws attention to the problematic legal and practical issues in the division of competences between the EU and the UK in the field of taxation. It primarily focuses on direct taxation. However, many competence issues discussed in this evidence, such as those related to the procedural and substantive conditions defining the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure, apply equally in a wider tax policy context...|$|R
40|$|Tumour growth results, in particular, from cell-cell {{interaction}} and tumour and healthy cell proliferation.

In this paper <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> equations are <b>reviewed</b> to account for directionality onto a collective migration of the tumour cell population, via an attractive force of the chemotactic type, {{in addition to the}} customary pressure term. The density of tumour cells turns out to be governed by a hyperbolic differential equation. By neglecting, as usual, the inertia term it follows that the density satisfies a backward, or forward, diffusion equation according as the attraction, or pressure effect, prevails. Uniqueness of the solution to the backward equation is investigated and a family of solutions is described. An estimate is given for the growth rate of a tumour profile...|$|R
40|$|As {{we saw in}} the introduction, the Open Method of Coordination has aroused fierce controversies {{about its}} {{democratic}} legitimacy, practical effectiveness, and implications for European integration. Yet as we also saw, much of the debate surrounding the OMC has suffered from a serious empirical deficit, relying on a narrow range of often outdated evidence, and based mainly on official printed sources. Drawing on the previous chapters of this book, as well as on other recent research (both published and unpublished), this concluding essay seeks to redress <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> by <b>reviewing</b> <b>the</b> available evidence about the OMC in action, focusing particularly on the operations and impact of the European Employment and Social Inclusion Strategies at national and subnational levels. In order to establish appropriate criteria for the empirical assessment {{in the body of the}} chapter (Part II), the next section (Part I) briefly revisits the core claims for the theoretical promise of the OMC as a new mode or instrument of EU governance advanced by its proponents. Although the resulting assessment, as we shall see, is positive in many respects, it also highlights some significant practical limitations that inhibit the realization of the OMC’s theoretical promise. The final section (Part III) therefore considers how to overcome the shortcomings revealed by the empirical assessment, and proposes a reflexiv...|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{written as}} a chapter for a Handbook of International Economics, reviews {{developments}} {{in the theory of}} international monetary economics from the late 1960 's through the early 1980 's. Following a review of the operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment {{in the context of the}} Mundell-Fleming model, the paper reviews the more modern analysis of <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>balance</b> of payments adjustment under fixed exchange rates and of exchange rate determination under flexible exchange rates. Beginning with a simple exposition of the monetary mechanism, the model is then extended to incorporate sluggish wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary policy and sterilization operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable goods, large countries, capital mobility and portfolio <b>balance.</b> <b>The</b> <b>review</b> then turns to an exposition of exchange rate theory, starting with the monetary approach to exchange rate determination. Issues discussed in this context include purchasing power parities, nontraded goods, the real exchange rate, currency substitution and the interaction between real and monetary factors in effecting exchange rates. The paper proceeds with a presentation of a more general framework that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of the general theory of the determination of asset prices, and which highlights the unique role of expectations. The general framework is then applied to characterize the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> of payments and the equilibrium real exchange rate. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some empirical issues of exchange rate analysis. ...|$|R
