5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of <b>that</b> <b>phone</b> {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E

At the time The Guardian made these claims, Coulson had left News International and was director of Conservative Party communications and planning. Due to this, some claimed that the reporting was politically motivated. The Conservative Party was quick to stand by Coulson.|$|E

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the receiving party pays systems is <b>that</b> <b>phone</b> owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, {{which results in}} the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries.

25|$|A {{customer}} satisfaction survey {{was carried out in}} 2009–2010 for all towns served by NWSC. It covered questions such as satisfaction with water reliability, water pressure, water quality, timely and accurate water bills, responsiveness in resolving complaints, responsiveness in effecting new connections, customer care, and the convenience of the bill payment process. Out of 5,319 customers contacted in a stratisfied sample, 2,731 responded. Customer care received the highest rating, while water quality and pressure received lower, but overall good, ratings. A {{customer satisfaction}} index was calculated across all questions, showing that 85 percent of customers were satisfied, up from 83 percent during the last survey. Satisfaction was highest in Hoima, Iganda, and Masindi at 95 percent and lowest in the central Ugandan town of Mubende, where no customer care officer or desk existed, at 62 percent. In Kampala, satisfaction was 83 percent. Customers appreciated the ambiance in local offices, <b>that</b> <b>phone</b> calls are made to remind customers of payment, that customers can settle their arrears through payment plans in exceptional cases, and that water cuts are announced through the radio. Customers complained about low water pressure, muddy water during the wet season, supply interruptions during the dry season, low water pressure, slow implementation of new connections, erratic bills, disconnection despite having paid their water bills, and the rudeness of field staff.|$|E

[...] Reports suggested that MCA spent over $2 million promoting Smithson's previous album which she made under the name Carly Hennessy. The album sold fewer than 400 copies. Smithson remained on the show, and placed sixth in her season. Jermaine Jones of season eleven was disqualified for having theft cases and outstanding warrants on Top 11 week.|$|E
40|$|Some {{animal studies}} have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> mobile <b>phone</b> radiation may cause increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. We have hypothesized (Leszczynski et al.

2500|$|While {{some claim}} <b>that</b> <b>phone</b> text {{messaging}} {{is the primary}} cause of character amnesia, the phenomenon, at least in Japan, appears to originate with widespread use of word processors.

A 1993 survey of members of the Information Processing Society of Japan found that habitual word processor users reported declining ability to write characters by hand. The Japanese term [...] describes a person whose handwriting ability has deteriorated due to overreliance on computer input methods.|$|E
