5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. <b>Those</b> <b>talks</b> stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth {{the manager of}} the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, and his {{business}} manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner Frank Navin made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him {{to take part in a}} celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.|$|E

25|$|According to Braves team {{president}} John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $150million in renovation costs merely for structural upkeep (i.e., not for fan experience improvements).

The Braves were in talks in 2013 with the Recreational Authority over extending the team's original lease, Plant said, but <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> broke down. Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed said the city {{could not afford to}} support the kind of renovations the Braves desired.|$|E

25|$|The Central {{then turned}} to other {{carriers}} outside of the Northeast, particularly the Chesapeake & Ohio which controlled the Baltimore & Ohio and the Western Maryland. The Chesapeake & Ohio was a very profitable coal carrier that has expanded into the Midwest. The Central saw the C as the perfect merger partner. The C's coal {{would serve as a}} pillar of stability, while the Central's and B's network throughout the Midwest would add new business opportunities. On paper it was the perfect marriage. The NYC and the C/B complemented each other, whereas the NYC and PRR duplicated each other's efforts just about everywhere. Serious merger discussions were held between the NYC and the C, but <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> failed too when agreement could not be reached. With nowhere else to turn, the New York Central reluctantly restarted talks with the Pennsylvania in the early 1960s, which {{led to the creation of}} the Penn Central.|$|E
25|$|In early 1997, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland {{stated that}} he did not want to spend Connecticut {{taxpayer}} dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford. Despite this, negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new $147.5 million arena seemed to be going well. After a near-complete agreement, talks fell apart at the last minute when Karmanos wanted an additional $45 million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built. The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the 1996–97 season. This marks one of the few times that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one. Karmanos had discussed relocating the Whalers to Norfolk, Virginia (which would have been the first major sports team for that market) as the Hampton Roads Rhinos, but the failure of a season-ticket drive in Norfolk, coupled with a lack of an adequate arena, led to those plans being canceled. Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a National Football League (NFL) franchise to the State. Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut, but <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> also fell apart after the State and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium.|$|E

The outcome of <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> was an agreement in which the Ethiopians recognized the right of the Eritreans to hold a referendum on independence.

2500|$|In 1993, Chicago {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} their 22nd album [...] This album {{was to have}} marked their return to their traditional composition of the 1970s, emphasizing major horn accompaniment. However, following a reorganization of the record company, the new executives at Reprise Records (now part of the newly formed Warner Music Group) rejected the completed album. It remained unpublished for fifteen years, aside from bootleg tapes and Internet files. This contributed to the parting of the band from the record label. The band was dismayed {{by the failure of}} the label. Upset with the shelving of the album, Dawayne Bailey left the group in late 1994, leading to many years of debates and conjecture about the events surrounding the recordings. It was also suggested some years later that the band's management was negotiating with the label regarding a licensing of the extensive Chicago back catalog, and when <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> stalled, the label apparently retaliated by scrapping the project. The album eventually saw an expanded release on Rhino Records in June 2008 to favorable reviews from both fans and critics and made it to No. 122 on the album charts.|$|E
2500|$|The ethics {{agreement}} between the State Department and Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation that was put into force {{at the beginning of}} the secretary's tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during early 2015. A Wall Street Journal report found that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended. A Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found a six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, which was permissible under the agreement, and also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria in January 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not. The Post noted that the donation [...] "coincided with a spike" [...] in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record but that during 2010 and 2011 the Department still issued human rights reports critical of Algeria's restrictions on freedom of assembly, women's rights and labor rights that also pointed to instances of extrajudicial killings, corruption, and lack of transparency in the government. A Politico analysis of State Department documents found that the department approved virtually all of Bill Clinton's proposed speaking engagements, even when they lacked sufficient information about the valuation of <b>those</b> <b>talks</b> or links between them and possible subsequent donations to the Clinton Foundation.|$|E
