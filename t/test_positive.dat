5|$|The {{day after}} the race, an International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{spokesperson}} announced that Spanish rider María Isabel Moreno had become the first athlete of the 2008 Olympics to <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for a banned substance.|$|E
5|$|Mayo and Piepoli {{would both}} <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for {{erythropoietin}} later {{in their careers}} at the Tour de France, and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, all leading to lengthy suspensions, while Petacchi made a successful return to top-level cycling and to the Giro in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August, four horses from Brazil, Germany, Ireland and Norway tested {{positive}} for a banned substance. The riders were subsequently disqualified from the individual competition and if the B samples <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> then Brazil, Germany and Norway will be disqualified from the team competition and Great Britain will move into 5th place.|$|E
50|$|E1b1a1a1a {{is defined}} by marker M58. 5% (2/37) of the town Singa-Rimaïbé, Burkina Faso <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for E-M58. 15% (10/69) of Hutus in Rwanda <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for M58. Three South Africans <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for this marker. One Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for the M58 SNP. The place of origin and age is unreported.|$|R
5000|$|Fighter Tim Percy <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for methamphetamines {{after his}} fight, and was {{suspended}} by the CSAC. [...] In addition, Johnnie Morton <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for anabolic steroids and Royce Gracie <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for Nandrolone, a commonly used anabolic steroid.|$|R
50|$|During the 2014 season three riders, Ilya Davidenok, Victor Okishev and Artur Fedosseyev <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for {{anabolic}} androgenic steroids. Davidenok <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> at the Tour de l'Avenir, Okishev <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> at the Asian Cycling Championships while Fedosseyev <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> at Tour de l'Ain. The riders were provisionally suspended awaiting doping hearings. The {{next day}} Alexander Vinokourov, head of , {{was reported to}} have suspended the entire continental team.|$|R
5|$|On July 21, Ramirez hit his 537th career home run, passing Mickey Mantle for 15th {{place on}} the all-time home run list. On July 30, The New York Times {{reported}} that Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during Major League Baseball's 2003 survey testing. Ramirez, {{a member of the}} Boston Red Sox at the time, was among 104 major league players to <b>test</b> <b>positive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. Tuberculosis {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the US population <b>test</b> <b>positive.</b> Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who <b>test</b> <b>positive.</b> It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, {{three of}} the four women from India's gold-medal winning 400-metre-relay team <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for performance-enhancing drugs. Two of the racers, Sini Jose and Jauna Murmu, <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for the {{anabolic}} steroid methandienone, and Tiana Mary Thomas <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for epi-methandienone.|$|R
2500|$|Stephan Bonnar and Josh Barnett, mixed {{martial arts}} (MMA) fighters from the UFC and PRIDE Fighting Championships, have also <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for the banned substance. After the World Extreme Cagefighting show on January 20, 2006 Muay Thai turned MMA fighter Kit Cope also <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for {{boldenone}}. Following the Strikeforce card on June 22, 2007 former PRIDE and UFC fighter Phil Baroni <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for boldenone, {{as well as}} stanozolol. At a K-1 WGP event in Las Vegas on August 17, 2007 two fighters, Rickard Nordstrand and Zabit Samedov, both <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for boldenone. [...] Alexandre Franca Nogueira <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for boldenone in July 2008.|$|R
50|$|In June 2014, UFC fighter Chael Sonnen <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for EPO. One month later, another UFC fighter, Ali Bagautinov also <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for EPO.|$|R
5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|After further investigation, it was {{revealed}} on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had {{tested positive for the}} banned steroid THG. Analysis of his backup sample also tested positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003, making Chambers the first person to <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for the new drug. Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending. The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two-year ban from athletics, backdated to begin on 7 November 2003. He was also banned for life from the Olympics and stripped of the medals he had won since mid-2002, after admitting that he had taken THG from that date. Chambers' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased, costing teammates Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process. Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF to pay back his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
50|$|In March 2009 Christian Pfannberger <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for EPO and {{was banned}} for life. In April {{the same year}} Antonio Colom <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for EPO.|$|R
30|$|Almost {{the entire}} patient group (n[*]=[*] 46; 87 %) <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for {{leukocyte}} esterase (i.e. gave {{a reading of}} + 2 or + 3 according to the bedside automated analyzer). However of those <b>testing</b> <b>positive,</b> only 13 % (n[*]=[*] 6) also <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> {{for the presence of}} bacteria above 105  CFU ml− 1. A significant association of the ‘gold-standard’ test and leukocyte esterase test was determined using the Fisher’s exact test (P[*]<[*] 0.01). In contrast to leukocyte esterase, a minority of patients (n[*]=[*] 4; 8 %) <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for nitrites. Of those <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> for nitrites, 50 % (n[*]=[*] 2) also <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for the presence of bacteria above 105  CFU ml− 1. The majority (80 %, n[*]=[*] 39) of those testing negative for nitrites were also culture negative. When combining leukocyte esterase and nitrite dipstick tests, only 7 patients (14 %) showed parity (i.e. both <b>tests</b> were <b>positive,</b> or both <b>tests</b> were negative). Zero patients <b>tested</b> <b>positive</b> for both dipsticks and positive for the presence of bacteria above 105  CFU ml− 1, and only 2 % (n[*]=[*] 1) tested negative for both dipsticks and bacteria levels below 105  CFU ml− 1.|$|R

5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
5|$|One-third of the world's {{population}} {{is thought to}} be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2016, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths. This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> while 5–10% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Steve Burdick {{is a local}} {{television}} news anchor who keeps his homosexuality private. He and his lover are tested for HIV and both <b>test</b> <b>positive.</b> Burdick struggles to keep himself together as his lover's health declines. When his lover dies, Burdick breaks down {{on the air and}} announces the death and that he too is HIV-positive. Station managers want to fire him, but his producer, Barbara Hudson, convinces the station that AIDS reportage is newsworthy and socially responsible. Burdick's pieces are tagged with a viewer discretion advisory. He continues to report until he begins to show symptoms of AIDS, at which time the station managers pull him off the air.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women <b>test</b> <b>positive</b> in the US.|$|E
