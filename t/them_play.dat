5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of <b>them,</b> <b>play</b> is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, Tecmo {{released}} a demo {{and a new}} game mode, Survival Mode, for Sigma over the PlayStation Network. The demo limits players to {{the first chapter of}} the game, but lets <b>them</b> <b>play</b> as Rachel in a separate mission. Survival Mode comprises missions in which players keep fighting until they have either killed all their opponents, or their character has been defeated.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear <b>them</b> <b>play.</b> Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike, usually “chatting” with other gandingan players further away. Locals says {{much of this}} jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes, where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air.|$|E

5|$|The four {{released}} {{their debut}} full-length studio album, Something About Airplanes, on August 18, 1998. The album was favorably reviewed {{in the independent}} music scene. In 1998 the band also met their long-term manager Jordan Kurland. Kurland had heard good things about them, and after a failed attempt to see <b>them</b> <b>play</b> at South By Southwest finally hooked up with them when touring with his then client, the band Crumb.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rivalry and bowl implications, this game also decided who would {{represent}} the South Division at the Big 12 Championship Game in Kansas City. At {{the beginning of}} the week, Texas and Oklahoma were tied for the lead with Texas holding the tie-breaker due to their win in the Red River Rivalry earlier in the year. However, since Texas lost to Texas A on November 24, a Sooner victory at State would win them the division outright and let <b>them</b> <b>play</b> Nebraska for the Big12 title and a spot in the Fiesta Bowl (awarded contractually to the Big12 winner if they are not selected to play in the national championship game).|$|E

5|$|CenturyLink Field is also {{designed}} for soccer. The first sporting event held included a United Soccer Leagues (USL) Seattle Sounders match. The USL team began using the stadium regularly for home games in 2003. The MLS expansion team Seattle Sounders FC, began its inaugural season in 2009 at the stadium. CenturyLink Field {{was the site}} of the MLS Cup in 2009. The venue also hosted the 2010 and 2011 tournament finals for the U.S. Open Cup. Sounders FC won both times and new attendance records were set each year it was hosted at CenturyLink Field. In August 2013, the Sounders broke a new home field attendance record when 67,385 fans turned out to watch <b>them</b> <b>play</b> the Portland Timbers.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd of Bullets, earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see <b>them</b> <b>play</b> at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Nasution {{siblings}} {{formed a}} band; Chrisye and Joris watched <b>them</b> <b>play</b> songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) {{to fulfill his}} father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, {{as a replacement for}} their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could.|$|E

5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face {{an uphill battle}} {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. As {{was the case in}} Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let <b>them</b> <b>play</b> their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E
5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat <b>them.</b> <b>Play</b> controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
5|$|Kittie {{was formed}} in 1996, when drummer Mercedes Lander and guitarist Fallon Bowman met in gym class. Mercedes' sister, Morgan, became Kittie's lead vocalist and guitarist after Fallon and Mercedes jammed for several weeks; Tanya Candler {{completed}} the lineup as bassist. Kittie recorded demos and began playing dates in 1998. They played Call the Office and the Embassy, and signed up for Canadian Music Week in 1999. Kittie approached Jake Weiner, second-in-command at NG Records; when he saw <b>them</b> <b>play</b> live, Weiner signed them to NG {{during the summer of}} 1999. NG was acquired by Artemis Records toward the end of 1999, and producer Garth Richardson obtained the band's demo. Kittie recorded Spit, produced by Richardson, at EMAC Studios in London, Ontario. Mercedes Lander said that Spit was recorded in nine days.|$|E

5|$|The Scotland manager has sole {{responsibility}} for all on-the-field {{elements of the}} Scotland team. Among other activities, this includes selecting the national team squad, the starting team, captain, tactics, substitutes and penalty-takers. The manager has input in selecting the coaching ("back room") staff. For example, in 2008 manager George Burley helped to recruit Terry Butcher, a former teammate at Ipswich Town, as his assistant. The Scotland manager may also involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues, such as negotiating fixtures. In the period before a manager was appointed, the team was picked by the international selection committee of the Scottish Football Association (SFA). This committee {{was made up of}} officials from Scottish clubs, who had {{responsibility for}} picking their own sides. There were large inconsistencies in selection; however, and players were often picked without {{some or all of the}} selectors having watched <b>them</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ross {{took over}} an {{improved}} team. He had recently signed three players, Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart, who all {{grew up together}} in Kitchener, Ontario, and had <b>them</b> <b>play</b> on the same line, soon nicknamed the Kraut Line {{in reference to the}} German heritage of all three. Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, Frank Brimsek; after Brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games, the Bruins traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players the Bruins finished first in the league in 1937–38; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season All-Star Second Team. The next season the Bruins won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the playoffs; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season. He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach the Bruins for the 1939–40 NHL season. The Bruins would win the Cup again in 1941, and tied their record of only four away losses all season. Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941–42 season began, as Weiland became coach of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league. By this time the Second World War had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces. The Bruins finished second in the NHL during the 1942–43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs in 1943–44, the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something they did for five straight years.|$|E
