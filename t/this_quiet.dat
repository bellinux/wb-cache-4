5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from the Somali film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> revolution. In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> period to test his spatial awareness and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2mya). The scale of the eruptive events that {{produced}} these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet, though whether or not <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.|$|E

60|$|But {{little was}} {{said on the}} way. I was busy with my own thoughts, and so were Mr. Woodward and Stumpy. The farmer asked several questions, but the {{merchant}} said he would learn all he wished to know at the judge's office, and <b>this</b> <b>quieted</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Madeline hesitated, {{then stopped}} {{in the middle of}} the porch. Alfred, Florence, and several others {{followed}} her out; the rest of the cowboys and guests crowded the windows and doors. Stillwell saw Madeline, and, throwing up his hands, roared to be heard. <b>This</b> <b>quieted</b> the gesticulating, quarreling men.|$|R

25|$|The Levett-Scriveners, {{and most}} of their Scrivener relatives, are buried at St. Peter's Church in Sibton, near Yoxford, Suffolk.

25|$|In 1969, Davis fully {{embraced the}} {{electric}} instrument approach to jazz with In a Silent Way, {{which can be}} considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer Teo Macero, <b>this</b> <b>quiet,</b> static album would be equally influential {{to the development of}} ambient music.|$|E

50|$|His {{first act}} {{was to meet}} with his Council of State and request the {{resignation}} of João Franco, whose policies may {{have been responsible for}} the tragedy. He appointed a government of national unity, presided over by Admiral Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. <b>This</b> <b>quieted</b> the republicans, but in retrospect was seen as weakness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely {{some terrible}} fever is seizing on me!" [...] I exclaimed, {{and in the}} terror of the thought I started up and paced my room rapidly. But the fire increased, and my head swam. I meditated ringing the bell and {{alarming}} the household; {{but the thought of}} <b>this</b> <b>quieted</b> me, and gradually I became calmer.|$|R
25|$|Commentators and {{policy-makers}} {{suspected that}} {{a large chunk of}} people on Incapacity Benefit had got better but had kept <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> and were still receiving payments. Another, more charitable, view was that recent disability legislation and changes in the workplace might have removed some of the barriers to disabled people returning to work.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>quiet</b> and {{uncertain}} situation was abruptly interrupted on 14 July, {{two days before}} the murder of Nicholas II and his family. That morning a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were transported to a small, walled village, where they could be more easily guarded.|$|E
25|$|Growing {{out of the}} Somali people's rich {{storytelling}} tradition, {{the first}} few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following {{the creation of the}} Somali Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. The Somali filmmaker Ali Said Hassan concurrently served as the SFA's representative in Rome. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. Said Salah Ahmed during this period directed his first feature film, The Somali Darwish (The Somalia Dervishes), devoted to the Dervish State. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> revolution.|$|E
60|$|At this {{there was}} a loud complaint, and the three made all manner of protestations, but the master of the Columbia was obdurate, and at last {{threatened}} to throw them into the hold again. <b>This</b> <b>quieted</b> them for the time being, and after being given a square meal and a drink of water, they were marched off to the brig, which was cleaned of everything else for their accommodation.|$|R

50|$|After Mexican Independence, he {{returned}} to Spain, where, due to his wide experience in modern minery methods, he was appointed Minister of Minery in 1822, and supervised the modern mining of the mines in Almadén, Guadalcanal, and Río Tinto. After falling from his ministry, he was appointed yet again General Director of Mines, and resumed his research activities in chemistry from <b>this</b> <b>quieter</b> office till his death in Madrid on January 6, 1833.|$|R
500|$|The {{referendum}} and {{the protests}} against it also drew attention abroad. On 12 September 1988, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote: [...] "A referendum on accepting refugees in <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> Swedish town has flared into an ugly battle watched closely by {{a country that}} prides itself on its tolerant attitudes and absence of racism." ...|$|E
500|$|Final {{approach}} {{segments of}} LFR instrument approaches were normally flown near the range station, which ensured increased accuracy. When the aircraft {{was over the}} station, the audio signal disappeared, {{since there was no}} modulation signal directly above the transmitting towers. <b>This</b> <b>quiet</b> zone, called the [...] "cone of silence", signified to the pilots that the aircraft was directly overhead the station, serving as a positive ground reference point for the approach procedure.|$|E
500|$|Bookmakers {{estimated}} that over £1million {{would be spent}} gambling {{on the outcome of}} the storyline. Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode's transmission, taking £100,000 in bets on 30 different characters, while William Hill took £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on Dallas Who shot J. R.? storyline in 1980. Spokesman Rupert Adams commented: [...] "The BBC were amazing keeping <b>this</b> <b>quiet.</b> We have broken even which in a market like this is amazing. We have had a roller-coaster but have enjoyed every minute." ...|$|E
50|$|Rafting and jetboating in the Buller Gorge {{are also}} popular. Many South Island {{visitors}} do however pass by <b>this</b> <b>quieter</b> area, opting instead {{to go to}} Abel Tasman National Park, to Hanmer Springs or, if they do visit the West Coast, to Greymouth and the Fox- and Franz Josef glaciers further south. Westport is also a base for trips to Karamea, with the only road access to the area running north from near Westport.|$|R

500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Everything Everything {{went into}} the studio aiming to [...] "make people want to move", and set about {{avoiding}} slower-paced songs that had featured strongly on their previous album. This became apparent to them following the writing of eventual album closer [...] "Warm Healer". Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, told Anthem Magazine that [...] "we kind of ripped up that rule book after realiing, 'Right. Let’s not write something <b>this</b> <b>quiet.</b> Let’s do horrible stuff from now on'". The group worked on ideas for songs as they came to them, rather than their previous method of practising and recording as a live group. Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, explained to Skiddle that the group were keen to create a record that would [...] "stand up for the huge amount of time you spend touring a record", which in turn inspired a more pop-oriented sound than had appeared on Arc. Higgs later discussed how they used their previous sound to inform the direction of Get to Heaven, seeking to avoid [...] "quiet songs" [...] and [...] "tenderness" [...] {{in an effort to}} [...] "inject a new fire into ourselves".|$|E
500|$|In early April 1945, Anna {{arranged}} for Rutherfurd {{to come over}} from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his [...] "Little White House" [...] in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E

5000|$|The {{debate over}} the {{definition}} of [...] {{has been going on}} at least since the early 19th century. At that time, most mathematicians agreed that , until in 1821 Cauchy listed [...] along with expressions like [...] in a table of indeterminate forms. In the 1830s Libri published an unconvincing argument for , and Möbius sided with him, erroneously claiming that [...] whenever [...] A commentator who signed his name simply as [...] "S" [...] provided the counterexample of , and <b>this</b> <b>quieted</b> the debate for some time. More historical details can be found in Knuth (1992).|$|R
500|$|... "Something There" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken. According to Menken, [...] "Something There" [...] was written as [...] "a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again'," [...] the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered [...] "too ambitious" [...] for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't {{figure out how to}} make it work and not take away from the central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work".|$|E
2500|$|With the outlawing of the African {{slave trade}} on January 1, 1808, many Americans {{felt that the}} slavery issue was resolved. [...] Any {{national}} discussion that might have continued over slavery was {{drowned out by the}} years of trade embargoes, maritime competition with Great Britain and France, and, finally, the War of 1812. [...] The one exception to <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> regarding slavery was the New Englanders' association of their frustration with the war with their resentment of the three-fifths clause that seemed to allow the South to dominate national politics.|$|E
2500|$|Many seismologists {{believe that}} the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which {{occurred}} on the San Andreas fault, reduced the stress on many faults in the Bay Area including the Hayward fault, creating an [...] "earthquake shadow": a quiescent period following a major earthquake. Since the 1906 San Andreas event {{there have been no}} moderately strong earthquakes on the Hayward fault as were seen before that earthquake. It also appears likely that <b>this</b> <b>quiet</b> period in the earthquake shadow is ending, as projected by the rate of plate motion and the stress state of other faults in the region.|$|E
