5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> is encountered.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms {{of potato}} 'ring rot' are {{yellowing}} {{of the leaf}} margins which later turn brown and look like they are burned. Tubers rot from the inside, sometimes progressing to leave hollow shells. Rotting of the tubers is the more common symptom. Infected land cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years.

25|$|Although insects {{can be a}} problem, by far {{the biggest}} killer of {{carnivorous}} plants (besides human maltreatment) is grey mold (Botrytis cinerea). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and can be a real problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a fungicide is in order.|$|E
30|$|Human {{tuberculosis}} {{is caused}} principally by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The main causative agents of bovine tuberculosis is Mycobacterium bovis and cattle {{are the major}} reservoir. The zoonotic transmission of <b>this</b> <b>pathogens</b> occurs primarily through close contact with infected cattle or consumption of contaminated animal products such as unpasteurized milk. Tuberculosis cases caused by transmission of mycobacteria from animal reservoirs (e.g., wildlife) have been anecdotally reported.

40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} virus (IBV), Avian {{influenza virus}} (AIV) and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) {{have been recognized}} {{as the most important}} pathogens in poultry cause acute respiratory infection and serous economic problems in Iraq and many other countries all over the world. This study was conducted to investigate the distribution of these diseases in commercial chicken flocks in different geographical region in middle part of Iraq by using qPCR. Tracheal swabs and tissue specimens from trachea, lung and kidney were taken from 38 different cases from commercial broiler chicken flocks in (Najaf, Hilla, Muthana and Theqaar governorates) in the period from November 2010 to June 2011, all these flocks were showed respiratory symptoms and mortality about 20 - 90 %. The results showed that 92. 1 % of samples collected from these flocks were infected with IBV, 20 % of samples were infected with IB alone and 45. 71 % of samples with IB combined with both GM and AIV subtype H 9 and 25. 71 % of samples were positive to both IBV and AIV(H 9). No samples were positive to AIV (H 9) or MG alone. Because of importance of respiratory diseases as a most common conditions noted in commercial flocks in Iraq and no previous study detecting <b>this</b> <b>pathogens</b> by molecular techniques, this study come to detect and confirm the diagnosis of <b>this</b> <b>pathogens</b> by qPCR as new technique used in this field in Iraq...|$|R

25|$|Results of E. coli O157:H7 {{destruction}} on an alloy containing 99.9% copper (C11000) {{demonstrate that}} <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> is rapidly and almost completely killed (over 99.9% kill rate) within ninety minutes {{at room temperature}} (20°C). At chill temperatures (4°C), over 99.9% of E. coli O157:H7 are killed within 270 minutes. E. coli O157:H7 destruction on several copper alloys containing 99%–100% copper (including C10200, C11000, C18080, and C19700) at room temperature begins within minutes.

25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, green monkey kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{have the potential for}} causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of Listeria bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E

25|$|The {{causal agent}} of {{bacterial}} wilt and canker of tomato survives in or on seeds {{for up to}} 8 months but occasionally also in plant refuse in the soil. The pathogen can be spread long distances because of its association with seeds. The risk of spreading the bacteria to healthy tomato plants is greatest during transplanting, tying, and suckering or any time when the host may be wounded. Once the bacteria enters the plant through a wound, it will move and multiply primarily in the xylem vessels. Once established, the bacteria may move into the phloem, pith, and cortex. Infection can result in either systemic or superficial disease. Systemic infections appear in 3–6 weeks {{and the risk of}} secondary infection goes up with water-splashing. The common occurrence of latent infections – presence of the pathogen within the host yet the host shows no symptoms – makes <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> especially dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E
25|$|As {{dental plaque}} or biofilm accumulates on the teeth near {{and below the}} gums, there is {{a shift in the}} {{composition}} of the biofilm from essentially streptococcus to an actinomyces dominant plaque. Motile bacteria is also seen more frequently. As this happens, inflammation sets in the gingiva. Initially, this takes the form of gingivitis, which represents inflammation confined to the soft tissues above the bone level. Inflammation in the gingiva can remain at the gingivitis level for a long period and will not progress to periodontitis, unless in the presence of local conditions or generalized host susceptibility. When this shift occurs, the immune system's response to plaque accumulation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic mediated response to lymphocytic and plasma cell-mediated response. Clinically, the gingiva presents swelling, redness and a tendency to bleed. This modifies the environment, leading to changes in the composition of the biofilm itself. As this happens, a predominantly gram-negative environment is established, with periodontal pathogens emerging. These include A. actinomycetemcomitans, the red complex bacteria (P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, T. denticola) {{and to a lesser extent}} the orange complex bacteria (F. nucleatum, P. micros, P. intermedia, P. nigrecens, E. nodatum and S. constellates). Strongest bacterial association to chronic periodontitis is with P. gingivalis. Numerous virulence factors have been identified for <b>this</b> <b>pathogen.</b> This allows P. gingivalis to elude defense mechanism and perpetuate inflammation inside the periodontium. Prolonged inflammation in the periodontium leads to an apical shift in the attachment of the gingiva to the tooth with deepening pockets and bone loss around the teeth. Untreated periodontitis progresses unevenly over time but results in loss of function, tissue destruction, and tooth loss.|$|E

500|$|The Walking Dead {{takes place}} after the onset of a {{worldwide}} zombie apocalypse. The zombies, colloquially referred to as [...] "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans. Humans that they bite or scratch become infected and slowly turn into walkers as well. It is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry <b>this</b> <b>pathogen,</b> so that if they die from any other cause, they will also turn into walkers.

500|$|The {{main cause}} of TB is Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB), a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus. The high lipid content of <b>this</b> <b>pathogen</b> accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics.
