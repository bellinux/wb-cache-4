5|$|During their patrol, Wish Bear spots Christy {{stranded}} in a canoe within a lake; the other Bears and Cousins {{set out to}} rescue her. Dark Heart fires lightning bolts before the team, and captures many of them with his magic bag the favor he wanted Christy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> along. The few Family members at hand determine that she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 2017, Jesé {{signed for}} Las Palmas on loan {{until the end}} of the season, with club {{chairman}} Miguel Ángel Ramírez revealing that the player had taken a massive pay cut in order to join his hometown club. The next day, he was presented in front of 9,000 fans at the Estadio de Gran Canaria, and pledged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> he could to help the club qualify for European football. He debuted for the club on 6 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Vicente Gómez in a 1−0 loss away to Granada, and made his first start the following week in a loss to Sevilla by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the {{things on his}} list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing {{some of the things}} on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E

5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, {{in the role of}} Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
5|$|Foiled at the AOC, boycott advocates {{turned to}} the AAU, hoping that the {{athletics}} organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify athletes for Berlin. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU's December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members: William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke, asking them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> they could to ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating {{that he would be}} supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour's request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage's forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. In victory, Brundage was not magnanimous, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.|$|E

25|$|The {{strike was}} {{essentially}} a sitdown strike. Curran and the crew refused to leave the ship, for the owners would have simply replaced them with strikebreakers.

25|$|An {{internal}} Corrections audit {{reported that}} parole officers are overwhelmed.

25|$|Due to {{the change}} in orders and {{shortage}} of attack and combat cargo vessels, all of the division's 2.5 ton trucks, M1918 155-mm howitzers and the sound and flash-ranging equipment needed for counter-battery fire had to be left in Wellington. Also, because the Wellington dock workers were on strike at the time, the Marines had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the load reconfiguration from administrative to combat configuration.|$|E
25|$|Compared to scuba diving, {{dressing}} the diver in is {{a relatively}} laborious process, as the equipment is bulky and fairly heavy, and several components are connected together by hoses. This is more so with helmets, and less so with light full-face masks. It is not usual for the diver <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the dressing in without {{the assistance of a}} diver's tender, who will also manage the umbilical during the dive.|$|E

Racing out of the heads, she arrived in record time, breaking the 1999 race record set by the Volvo Ocean 60 Nokia. Wild Oats XI won on elapsed time, won on corrected time, and set a new record, becoming the only boat since the inaugural race of 1945 <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> three feats.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{is also a}} Court of Equity vested with powers, authority, and {{jurisdiction}} to administer justice and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> acts for the due execution of such equitable jurisdiction, in all cases where no legal remedy is provided by any enactment. Section 83 of the Constitution provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction {{in the interpretation of}} the Constitution. It has the power and {{jurisdiction to}} hear and determine any complaint of a disciplinary nature in respect of the professional conduct of a law practitioner or a ministerial officer including a land surveyor.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden spoon in 1950. During this period {{it was left}} to Trevor Bailey <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the pace bowling, and he was often {{unavailable}} due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex come back into {{the top half of the}} table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|They leave, and the miserly yet pompous and moralistic Grand Duke Rudolph appears, heralded by his {{corps of}} chamberlains. He instructs {{them in the}} {{arrangements}} for his wedding {{the next day to}} the rich, but also miserly, Baroness Caroline von Krakenfeldt. She arrives, handing him a letter from his detective, and they sing about how exactly in agreement are their ideas on economy. Caroline is disconcerted that Rudolph insists on courting her in the market square, but he explains that he has made a law compelling couples <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> courting in the square so as to increase the value of his properties around the square. She approves of this example of economy.|$|E
25|$|Her {{first period}} of {{education}} was at Liqing primary school. This school {{was one of}} several schools which accepted female students in Putian. Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E
