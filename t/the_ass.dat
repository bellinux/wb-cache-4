25|$|From the 18th century, donkey {{gradually}} replaced ass, {{and jenny}} replaced she-ass, {{which is now}} considered archaic. The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of rooster for cock, or that of rabbit for coney, which was formerly homophonic with cunny. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ass and arse had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> in English from this time include cuddy in Scotland, neddy in southwest England and dicky in the southeast; moke is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.|$|E

25|$|Devices {{found in}} Sanskrit {{literature}} such as frame stories and animal fables are {{seen by some}} scholars as lying {{at the root of}} the conception of the Nights. The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the Nights by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the Panchatantra and Baital Pachisi is particularly notable. The Jataka Tales are a collection of 547 Buddhist stories, which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. The Tale of the Bull and <b>the</b> <b>Ass</b> and the linked Tale of the Merchant and his Wife are found in the frame stories of both the Jataka and the Nights.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} scratch band ensemble varied, {{but always}} used a percussive instrument, either the squash, tambourine, or a local form of double-headed barrel drum {{similar to the}} Dominican tambora, {{as well as an}} accordion, cane flute or violin as a melodic instrument. String instruments were also common, including the banjo, ukulele or a six-string guitar. <b>The</b> <b>ass</b> pipe, made out of a car exhaust tube, often provided the bass, and was played similar to the tuba. Since about the 1980s, the instrumentation for scratch bands became more rigid. The alto saxophone became the most common melodic instrument, replaced sometimes by a silver flute. Conga drums, squash, electric guitar or bass guitar, and a steel (a triangle). Banjo or ukulele, keyboard and additional saxophones or other melodic instruments are more rarely found in modern bands.|$|E
500|$|A donkey (or ass) and an ox {{typically}} {{appear in}} nativity scenes. Besides {{the necessity of}} animals for a manger, this is an allusion to the Book of Isaiah: [...] "the ox knoweth his owner, and <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider". [...] The Gospels do not mention an ox and donkey Another source for the tradition may be the extracanonical text, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew of the 7th century. (The translation in this text of [...] is not taken from the Septuagint.):"And {{on the third day}} after the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mary went out of the cave, and, entering a stable, placed the child in a manger, and an ox and an ass adored him. Then was fulfilled that which was said by the prophet Isaiah, [...] "The ox knows his owner, and <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> his master's crib."

500|$|Positing {{the custom}} to be [...] "the {{survival}} of some ancient popular rite or ceremony", in 1888 David Jones suggested that its origins were Christian, {{and that it}} had once been part of the festivities of the Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Ass,</b> a commemoration of the flight into Egypt of Mary and Saint Joseph that was historically marked on January 14. According to Jones' idea, the Mari Lwyd itself represented the donkey on which Mary rode during the story.|$|E

You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better.

I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in <b>the</b> <b>ass,</b> although sometimes she is a pain in <b>the</b> <b>ass.</b> But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy.

500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck.

500|$|The group {{deliberately}} {{left out}} the grammatically correct question mark from the album title because aesthetically, [...] "it did not look right". The booklet insert contains stylized separate portraits of the Strokes, Raphael, Gentles, and Bowersock, all photographed by Lane. For the American market and the October 2001 release, the cover art of Is This It was changed to a psychedelic photograph of subatomic particle tracks in a bubble chamber. RCA product manager Dave Gottlieb commented that [...] "it was straight up a band decision", while Gentles indicated that Casablancas had wanted it to appear globally. According to the band's manager, the frontman phoned him before the Japan and Europe release and said, [...] "I found something even cooler than <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> picture." [...] At the time, the Lane photograph was already at the presses and {{was included in the}} July and August 2001 versions.

500|$|Mayr {{notes that}} Buffon {{was not an}} [...] "evolutionist", but was {{certainly}} responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France. He agrees that Buffon's thought is hard to classify and even self-contradictory, and that the theologians forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly. Mayr argues however that Buffon was [...] "fully aware {{of the possibility of}} 'common descent', and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly", quoting Buffon at length, starting with [...] "Not only <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> and the horse, but also man, the apes, the quadrupeds, and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family", and later [...] "that man and ape have a common origin", and that [...] "the power of nature...with sufficient time, she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings". Mayr notes, however, that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it, namely that no new species have arisen in historical times; that hybrid infertility firmly separates species; and that animals intermediate between, say, the horse and the donkey are not seen (in the fossil record).|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in <b>the</b> <b>ass</b> with B12 shots every day.

The lead single from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel was [...] "Obsessed". Many critics believed the track to be about Eminem, and its accompanying music video portrayed Carey being followed by a male stalker which critics also thought bore a strong resemblance to the rapper.
