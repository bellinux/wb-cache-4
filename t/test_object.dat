40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} distinct labels on infants’ inductive inferences. Thirty-six 15 -month-old infants were presented with target objects that possessed a nonobvious property, followed by <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> that varied in shape similarity relative to the target. Infants were tested {{in one of two}} groups, a Same Label group in which target and <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> were labelled with the same noun, and a Distinct Label group in which target and <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> were labelled with different nouns. When target and <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> were labelled with the same count noun, infants generalized the nonobvious property to both <b>test</b> <b>objects,</b> regardless of similarity to the target. In contrast, labeling the target and <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> with different count nouns attenuated infants’ generalization of the nonobvious property to both high and low similarity <b>test</b> <b>objects.</b> Our results suggest that by 15 -months, infants recognize that object labels provide information about underlying object kind and appreciate that distinct labels are used to designate members of different categories...|$|R

The invention provides that this classification of the sound spectrum of the <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> (1) takes place {{by means of a}} neural network (6), which was trained in the knowledge required for classification in a training phase preceding the actual classification phase by means of a selected set of <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> (1) of known classification...|$|R

500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the <b>test</b> <b>object,</b> so that fringes and <b>test</b> <b>object</b> can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E

50|$|In {{rotating}} electrical machines, {{the number}} of poles in the rotor multiplied by {{the number of}} strands in the stator equals the number of preferred stable positions in which the rotor moves. The amount of cogging torque is significantly influenced by the structural design. Regardless of the type of measurement, the load machine drives the currentless <b>test</b> <b>object.</b> The cogging torque is measured with a torque transducer connected between the <b>test</b> <b>object</b> and the load machine. The cogging torque can be determined in two different ways: Measurement of the cogging torque at slow speed or measurement of the cogging torque with closed-loop position control. For both measurements, an active load machine is required to drive the <b>test</b> <b>object.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Vibration calibrators [...] are {{electromechanical}} instruments which enable calibration of vibration {{sensors and}} measuring instruments to traceable standards. They produce sinusoidal mechanical vibration signals with known amplitudes and frequencies.

With older instruments {{it was necessary to}} adjust the vibration amplitude according to the weight of the <b>test</b> <b>object.</b> However, modern instruments contain a built-in reference accelerometer and closed-loop control, with which the amplitude is kept constant up to a maximum specified weight of <b>test</b> <b>object.</b> Older models can be used to calibrate objects weighing up to a maximum of approximately 100 g, whereas the latest instruments can work stably with test objects weighing over 500 g.|$|E

50|$|When {{a surface}} area is {{illuminated}} {{with a highly}} coherent laser light, a stochastical interference pattern is created. This interference pattern is called a speckle, and is projected on a rigid camera's CCD chip. Analogous with Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI), to obtain results from the speckle we need to compare it with a known reference light. Shearography uses the <b>test</b> <b>object</b> itself as the known reference; it shears the image so a double image is created. The superposition of the two images, a shear image, represents {{the surface of the}} <b>test</b> <b>object</b> at this unloaded state. This makes the method much less sensitive to external vibrations and noise. By applying a small load, the material will deform. A nonuniform material quality will generate a nonuniform movement of the surface of the <b>test</b> <b>object.</b> A new shearing image is recorded at the loaded state and is compared with the sheared image before load. If a flaw is present, it will be seen.|$|E

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in the 1930 s, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) has become recognized as a powerful in vivo diagnostic tool. The objective {{of this article is}} to discuss developments in quantitative MRI - and particularly texture analysis - that maximize diagnostic information, A fundamental part of the work involves careful study of the optimal MRI data collection strategies for texture analysis. This is critical, because different centers may vary their measuring sequences and acquisition protocols for clinical reasons, and may be reluctant to vary these for texture investigation. Different measuring techniques, such as spin echo, gradient echo, and echo planar, and different measuring parameters produce totally different patterns in texture. Careful investigation of the dependence of all these variables using texture phantoms (<b>test</b> <b>objects)</b> will help understand how MRI image texture is formed from tissue structures. Therefore, it is essential to design and test reliable and accurate <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> for a detailed assessment of texture analysis methods in MRI, The main feature of these <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> is their ability to simulate tissue-like textures with tissue-like MR relaxation properties. Long-term stability is also vital, as is uniformity of the overall texture. Another aspect is to examine the <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> under a whole range of MRI measuring sequences and imaging conditions using different scanners to determine their stability and utility...|$|R
40|$|Scan-derived {{landmarks}} {{locations and}} surface shapes {{are more and}} more used, but there is no commonly accepted protocol for evaluating the accuracy of these measurements. Therefore we propose a protocol for evaluating the accuracy of surface shape and the repeatability of scan-derived landmark locations. According to existing Japanese and German domestic standards, we propose to use an artefact (e. g. sphere with diameter of about 120 mm) calibrated very accurately for evaluating the accuracy of scanner-systems. For evaluating the repeatability of landmark locations, we propose to use an anthropomorphic dummy with landmark locations premarked. These <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> are measured by a 3 D body scanner to be evaluated. Evaluation parameters such as trueness, precision, and repeatability are calculated from the measured data. A round-robin test was conducted in six different institutes using 17 body/head/foot scanners produced by eight companies. The purposes of the roundrobin test were to evaluate the availability of <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> to different body scanners, and to examine the measurement locations of <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> and quality parameters to be reported. As a result, the proposed <b>test</b> <b>objects</b> could be measured and the data exported by all scanner systems except one, which could not export the ball measurement. For a comparative purpose, a figure of measured surface might be useful. Volledige congres : [URL] Journal issue : [URL]...|$|R
