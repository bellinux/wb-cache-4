500|$|While reading Dickinson's book, English novelist Jackie Collins {{ran into}} the author at a bookstore and asked the fellow author to lunch to discuss their mutual experiences. Janice Dickinson landed a {{television}} role as a judge on the program America's Next Top Model due to No Lifeguard on Duty. Show creator Tyra Banks explained to The Boston Herald her decision process: [...] "The reason why I hired Janice Dickinson is because I read her book (No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel), and that book represented every single thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> done. Every single thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> experienced." ...|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} of a morally questionable plan being formulated among the senior officers that winter. On Jan 1, 1872, Tyson wrote in his diary: [...] "Last month such an astonishing proposition was made to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> ceased thinking of it since... It {{grew out of a}} discussion as to the feasibility of attempting to get farther north next summer." [...] And then on April 19, 1872: [...] "Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made to me in the winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, when he got home, to expose the matter." [...] Author Farley Mowat has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a very high latitude.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1360s, Louis {{suffered}} from a skin disease with symptoms similar to leprosy. Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplation. After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: [...] "I call God as my witness <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen a monarch more majestic and more [...] or one who desires peace and calm as much as he." [...] He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states. Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1369. At their next meeting in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, Albert I of Bavaria, and Rupert I of the Palatinate joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs. However, Emperor Charles IV persuaded the two Wittelsbachs (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.|$|E

500|$|He reached 40 in as {{many minutes}} as Australia's total reached 50. Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney {{contributing}} 83 of those runs. Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131. By lunch, he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1/235, when he hit Macaulay to Patsy Hendren and was dismissed, having amassed 151 in 170 minutes. Former English captain Sir Pelham Warner said [...] "I say without hesitation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen a greater innings... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely". [...] Macartney's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494. He then took 2/51, removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to follow on; however, the Australians could not dismiss the hosts {{for a second time}} and the match ended in a draw.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
500|$|Bottomley's {{trial began}} on 19 May 1922, before Mr Justice Salter. As {{the case was}} beginning, Bottomley secured the {{agreement}} of the prosecuting counsel, Travers Humphreys, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle. Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses {{in connection with the}} club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least £50,000: [...] "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> fraudulently converted a penny of the Club's money". The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as [...] "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete", went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on {{all but one of the}} charges. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. Humphreys commented later: [...] "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".|$|E

500|$|Adams {{never bought}} a slave and {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> felt before..." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E

500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful I feel for it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you can understand that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to the Netherlands, the {{harmonica}} band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band [...] He would meet a number of influential acts who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the Hot Club de France and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserts, [...] "I can honestly say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard anyone better". The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940 he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 {{he was part of the}} entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942 Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943.|$|E
2500|$|She and Robert {{first met}} violinist Joseph Joachim in November 1844, {{when he was}} just of age 14. A year later she wrote in her diary that in a concert on Nov. 11, 1845 [...] "little Joachim was very much liked. He played a new violin concerto of Mendelssohn's, which is said to be wonderful". In May 1853 they heard Joachim play the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto. Clara wrote that he played [...] "with a finish, a depth of poetic feeling, his whole soul in every note, so ideally, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard violin-playing like it, and I can truly say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{received}} so indelible an impression from any virtuoso." [...] From that time there was a friendship between Clara and Joachim, which [...] "for more than forty years never failed Clara in things great or small, never wavered in its loyalty." ...|$|E
