5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he <b>then</b> <b>read</b> constantly for the next few days.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Miliband gained four A Levels—in Mathematics (A), English (A), Further Mathematics (B) and Physics (B)—and <b>then</b> <b>read</b> Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In {{his first}} year, {{he was elected}} JCR President, leading a student {{campaign}} against a rise in rent charges. In his second year he dropped philosophy, and was awarded an upper second class Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to graduate from the London School of Economics with a Master of Science in Economics.|$|E
5|$|Letcher {{enrolled}} in Joshua Fry's private academy near Danville, Kentucky, faring better under Fry's instruction {{than he had}} in the common schools, and gained a sound education. Following his instruction at Fry's academy, he returned to his father's brickyard, where tradition holds that he helped build the state's first governor's mansion alongside future governor Thomas Metcalfe. He <b>then</b> <b>read</b> law in the office of Humphrey Marshall, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Lancaster, Kentucky. He briefly served as a judge advocate in Colonel John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, <b>then</b> <b>read</b> aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are <b>then</b> <b>read</b> by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw <b>then</b> <b>read</b> George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 May, a meeting was held in Southery, Norfolk. The group, {{including}} a Thomas Sindall, marched through Denver to Downham Market {{to meet with the}} magistrates at their weekly meeting at The Crown public house. Sindall was the only person known to have been at both the riots at Downham Market and Littleport. He was killed by troopers at Littleport—see below. The mob of 1,500, mainly men but some women, besieged The Crown until the magistrates agreed to allow a deputation of eight rioters inside to make their pleas: to have work and two-shillings (£) per day. The magistrates acceded to these demands, but they had already called the yeoman cavalry from Upwell, who arrived at 5pm. Backed by the troops, the Riot Act was <b>then</b> <b>read</b> in the market place by Reverend Dering, causing further tussles, which subsided after arrests started to be made.|$|E
25|$|Both the plaintiffs' {{counsel and}} the defendant's counsel {{made use of}} the dictionaries. The plaintiffs' counsel read in {{evidence}} from the same dictionaries the definitions of the word tomato, while the defendant's counsel <b>then</b> <b>read</b> in evidence from Webster's Dictionary the definitions of the words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff <b>then</b> <b>read</b> in evidence from Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries the definitions of potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.|$|E

25|$|The Easter Vigil {{concludes with}} {{the celebration of}} the Eucharist (known in some traditions as Holy Communion). Certain {{variations}} in the Easter Vigil exist: Some churches read the Old Testament lessons before the procession of the Paschal candle, and <b>then</b> <b>read</b> the gospel immediately after the Exsultet.|$|E

One year later, he entered the sophomore class at Dickinson College, where he graduated in July 1838. He <b>then</b> <b>read</b> law with John M. Clayton, then the chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court.|$|E

He helped to found the Cui Bono Club, a discussion group for recent graduates.|$|E

He then entered a legal {{partnership}} with W. E. Showers before appointment as a deputy district attorney in 1888 for Multnomah County. In 1890, he was elected to represent Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives. A Republican, Hall served one two-year term, participating in the 1891 legislative session.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years into}} his {{apprenticeship}} Booth was converted to Methodism. He <b>then</b> <b>read</b> extensively and trained himself {{in writing and}} in speech, becoming a Methodist lay preacher. Booth was encouraged to be an evangelist primarily through his best friend, Will Sansom. Sansom and Booth both began in the 1840s to preach {{to the poor and}} the sinners of Nottingham, and Booth would probably have remained as Sansom's partner in his new Mission ministry, as Sansom titled it, had Sansom not died of tuberculosis, in 1849.|$|E

Then, 13 more speeches were given, especially on ecumenism and the Church's charitable efforts and attention to the poor, in addition to the topics from the previous meeting sessions.|$|E
25|$|Activation is {{performed}} with a utility supplied with Windows and Office called the Activation Wizard. It {{can be performed}} either over the Internet or by telephone. When activating over the Internet, the Activation Wizard automatically transmits and receives verification data to and from Microsoft servers, completing the process without any interaction by the user. Activation by telephone requires that a user and a Microsoft agent verbally exchange activation information. In this case, an installation ID is generated, which is <b>then</b> <b>read</b> to the agent. The agent verifies the information and replies with a confirmation ID, which is then typed into the Activation Wizard.|$|E
25|$|The term Lontara {{has also}} come to refer to {{literature}} regarding Bugis history and genealogy, including the Sure’ Galigo creation myth. Historically, Lontara was also used {{for a range of}} documents including contracts, trade laws, treaties, maps, and journals. These documents are commonly written in a contemporary-like book form, but they can be written in a traditional palm-leaf manuscript also called Lontara, in which a long, thin strip of dried lontar is rolled to a wooden axis in similar manner to a tape recorder. The text is <b>then</b> <b>read</b> by scrolling the lontar strip from left to right.|$|E
