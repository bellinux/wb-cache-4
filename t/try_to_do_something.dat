500|$|When Mr. Dooley {{could be}} found behind his bar, his sayings {{remained}} at a high standard. Roosevelt remained a target, friend, and White House host, one who took seriously what Mr. Dooley said and corresponded with Dunne about it.

Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment.

Every time we get the chance to work together I always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the Duke community gathered together during the Silent Vigil to raise awareness for racial equality on campus, presenting an opportunity for Local 77 to accentuate both their workplace and racial equality concerns. Duke students, faculty, and administration immersed in social equality reflections and negotiations over university policies protecting these rights. Local 77’s participation in the Silent Vigil contributed {{to the issue of}} race relations as a whole. As Rees Shearer eloquently described the role of Local 77’s presence at the Vigil, “In reflection, I think we needed Local #77 more than they needed us. We needed a way to express regret, to dissociate ourselves from {{the assassination}} and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> right about the dominant issue of our nation: race.” [...] This had been an issue long avoided by the Duke community and the divided nation.|$|E

If we can't make something great out of it let us at least <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> out of the ordinary". [...] In spite of disagreements and Verdi's need to constantly bully Piave into correcting his drafts (to the point where Maffei had a hand in re-writing some scenes of the libretto, especially the witches' chorus in Act 3 and the sleepwalking scene), their version follows Shakespeare's play quite closely, but with some changes. [...] Instead of using three witches as in the play, there is a large female chorus of witches, singing in three part harmony (though it should be noted that they are divided in three groups, and that every group sings as a single witch, using [...] "I" [...] and not [...] "we"). The last act begins with an assembly of refugees on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating victory over the tyrant.|$|E
