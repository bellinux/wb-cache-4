40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, the Department of Energy (DOE) and its {{predecessor}} agencies have initiated an array of policies aimed at limiting domestic consumption of fossil fuels. Several policy initiatives, aimed at residential fossil-based energy conservation, have included residential appliance efficiency standards, the commercialization of residential applications of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and solar <b>thermal</b> <b>appliances,</b> and the implementation of energy performance standards for buildings. Each of these programs alone will reduce residential fossil fuel consumption. However, it remains unclear how they interact. In this article I examine how two programs may interact. In particular, I assess how well appliance efficiency standards will reduce fuel consumption and whether a standards program will conflict with or complement the DOE's PV commercialization efforts. ...|$|E

40|$|By using IT-solutions, the {{flexibility}} on the demand {{side in the}} electrical systems could be increased. This is called demand response and {{is part of the}} larger concept called smart grids. Previous work in this area has concerned the utilization of demand response by grid owners. In this thesis the focus will instead be shifted towards the electrical companies that have balance responsibility, and how they could use demand response in order to make profits. By investigating electrical appliances in hourly measured households, the business value from decreasing electrical companies’ power imbalances has been quantified. By an iterative simulation scheme an optimal value was found to be 977 SEK/year and appliance. It could however be shown that the value became larger for energy inefficient households, and that such consumers’ participation in a demand response market would be prioritized ahead of other measures like isolating walls is rather unlikely. <b>Thermal</b> <b>appliance</b> whose load depend on the outdoor temperature are less valuable for demand response during the summer months, and the annual value would increase if less seasonally dependent appliances were used. Additionally, by increasing the market price amplitudes and the imbalance price volatility, it could be shown that the potential for such demand response markets is larger in e. g. the Netherlands and Germany...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to limited}} energy storage units in microgrids, how to {{regulate}} peak demand {{is one of}} the main challenges. Thus, researchers propose di↵erent techniques to flatten peak de-mand in individual residential buildings. However, if each home in the grid flattens peak demand only with its own power consumption information, it is possible that peak demand of the microgrid would not be flattened but only shifted to another period. Therefore, it is critical for homes to cooperate with each other to flatten peak demand. In this paper, we utilize the power-voltage relationship in individual homes to enable that each home can infer the information of power consumption in the community by locally moni-toring the voltage value on the common power line. The inferred information is then used for homes to flatten peak demand of the microgrids in a distributed manner. Further-more, we leverage existing <b>thermal</b> <b>appliances</b> (e. g., water heaters) as thermal “batteries ” in individual homes instead of purchasing batteries to flatten peak demand. We eval-uate our system’s performance by conducting experiments and extensive empirical data driven simulations. Evaluation results indicate that our design enables homes to e↵ectively flatten peak demand by more than 29 % without a↵ecting homeowners ’ behaviors...|$|E

The novelty of the work consists in carrying out a complete thermodynamic and environmental performance characterisation of the studied commercial system in a third-party laboratory. The main objectives of the experimental campaign have been the investigation and assessment of the electric and heat recovery performances in different cogeneration thermal power demand loads. The generator has been tested in five different thermal loads, whilst operated at full electric load, in order to simulate the coupling with <b>thermal</b> <b>appliances</b> of diverse nature. The cogeneration water inlet temperature has been varied from 20 °C (as in more complex cogeneration systems which may envisage a thermal storage and additional pre-heating section) to 50 °C (as for district heating purposes or heating of sanitary water). Each measurement has been acquired with a redundant approach for statistical purposes aiming to the reduction of uncertainty and to guarantee procedure robustness. Moreover, the design point experimental characterisation has been supported by an overall process calibration and simulation performed by means of an in-house software (GS), developed at the Department of Energy. Each component has been modelled using a 0 D approach, such that the required mass and energy balances of the plant can be compared with those obtained from the experimental activity. In conclusion, the overall performances have met the expectations, being characterised by a net electric efficiency of approximately 39 % and a total efficiency which may overcome 95 %...|$|E

Research completed in 1984 revealed some factors which were not accounted for in the original publication of the method; these findings were a result of the ASHRAE research project 359. In 1988 ASHRAE Research Project 472 worked to correct these oversights with the introduction of a classification system for walls, roofs, and zones. Additionally, a weighting factor database was generated to help correct for previous inaccuracies.

40|$|Plans for {{low-carbon}} {{transitions in}} cool climates typically include electrification of heating. This poses challenges for electrical network managers, who {{will need to}} cater for substantial new loads. Transition also implies at least two types of change in heating practices: (a) as people shift to electric heating and (b) as they adapt usage {{in response to the}} availability and price of power in a system that is supply-driven and increasingly reliant on renewable generation. From a systems point of view, electric storage heating has proved useful in the past and could offer a valuable source of flexibility in future, comparing favourably with the current generation of domestic batteries. In order to realise its potential, though, it has to be more readily controllable than traditional storage heaters, for two reasons. The people who use the heaters {{need to be able to}} heat their homes or offices adequately at times of their choosing, and system operators also need to be able to charge up or switch off heaters in response to conditions on local networks or on the transmission grid, to minimise curtailment of renewable generation when this is abundant or the use of back-up generation when demand exceeds supply. This paper explains why and how a new,’smart’ versión of an established technology – electric storage heating - is being tested to offer flexibility to networks that are supplied by an increasing proportion of renewable generation. Drawing on the demand response literature and on background research for a project in which smart <b>thermal</b> storage <b>appliances</b> are being tested in Ireland, Germany and Latvia, it sets out some theoretical and practical considerations about the role and of storage heating in energy transitions, the actors involved in demand response, and how value may be distributed between them.

40|$|The {{development}} of cost-effective highperformance parallel computing on multi-processor supercomputers makes it attractive to port excessively time consuming simulation software from personal computers (PC) to super computes.

40|$|ISBN : 978 - 91 - 633 - 4455 - 8 [URL] audienceToday due to new {{developments}} in the field of smart appliances and communications, new strategies in the residential sector can be employed to maintain the balance between electricity supply and demand. However the physical effects and the methods to evaluate the impact of these actions in the electric market system are not totally understood. This article describes a methodology that makes possible the evaluation of Demand Response (DR) actions in <b>thermal</b> household <b>appliances,</b> from which the possible benefits can be determined for the consumer and for the electric grid. The demand response actions that serve as example are associated with electric home heating load shifting when responding to a day-ahead real-time-pricing. The randomized operation {{of a large number of}} electric heaters is simulated through a simple building thermal model. This enables calculation of the change in peak power during, preceding and after the demand response event, as well as the change in energy used. An important feature is that due to the introduction of a thermal model in our analysis, the energy recovery ("energy pay-back" - increase in consumption of energy after the control period application of a load shift) can be also determined by comparison with a reference case where there is no load control. The model also simulates changes in the magnitude and timing of peak load and during, before and after the load shift. This aspect will provide important information on how much load can be reduced with the introduction of a DR action, but also how much it can increase after the DR action (or before the DR action, if a pre-heating strategy is used). The simulations are then coupled with real-time-pricing tariffs which represent the actual electric power supply price. Subsequently economic benefits can be calculated at different times of the day and for different weather conditions, taking into account all the physical features described previously...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{deployment}} {{of renewable energy}} sources {{is seen as a}} main contributor towards the transition to a more secure, affordable and decarbonised energy system. These intermittent and unpredictable energy sources however lead to variable and difficult to predict bidirectional power flows in distribution and transmission grids. Simultaneously, the total electricity consumption is increasing as opportunities for electrification of transport and heating arise. These trends are leading to increasingly complex supply and demand power flows, pressurising the electricity grids, markets and actors that are currently in use. In recent years demand response has received renewed research attention due to advances in control theory and the abundance of affordable computational and communication resources. Harnessing the flexibility on the residential demand side to help maintain the delicate balance between production and consumption does however pose several challenges. First, the vast number of communicating devices requires a cost-competitive solution. Secondly, the development of an efficient, practical, and reliable control scheme poses a significant challenge due to the large dimensionality of the problem. Next, the comfort of the end-user should always prevail. Also, the future smart electricity grid will consist of many stakeholders, each with their specific and opposing objectives. The final challenge consists of evaluating the most suitable control methodologies, demonstrating their usefulness in simulated and physical environments. This dissertation is focussed on the development of efficient, practical, and reliable control approaches for large clusters of residential appliances. The resulting virtual power plant can be used to offer valuable services to utilities and system operators, transforming end-users into green, active and profitable stakeholders of the energy transition. To this end, an existing market-based control approach has been predominantly adopted, extended and modified. Its inherent drawbacks of imperfect state information due to aggregation, dispatch deviations resulting from the bid functions, and applicability to <b>thermal</b> electrical <b>appliances</b> have been mitigated or resolved. Throughout this work, the economic and technical feasibility of the approaches was strongly kept in mind, and supported by practical, real-world deployments. The first part of this work uses a heterogeneous mix of device classes as used in the LINEAR project, a large-scale research and demonstration project using flexible appliances of 240 Belgian families. In order to assess the effectiveness of the developed approaches, a portfolio of demand response algorithms has been implemented in a simulation framework. The integrated load-flow solver allows to evaluate the economic and technical impact of realistic scenarios. First, a novel distributed voltage control mechanism is presented that has also been deployed in the pilot. Next, this mechanism is combined with an adaptation of the market-based approach towards appliances used in the pilot. Simulation results show that from an economic welfare perspective, multiple stakeholder objectives should be simultaneously taken into account. Following this, the double-layered control approach is extended with a self-adaptive machine learning technique. By incorporating the non-linear cluster dynamics and local grid congestions, the energy cost can be further reduced. Finally, in order {{to bridge the gap between}} highly realistic simulations and a hard-wired roll-out, a deployment architecture has been developed. This allows to rapidly evaluate framework code on a physical laboratory environment, real-time digital simulator, and potentially also pilot projects. The second part is dedicated to thermostatically controlled loads, which offer the largest combined residential power and energy storage capacity. First, the market-based approach is modified towards control of heterogeneous clusters of these appliances. The novel aggregate model based on virtual tracer devices is identified in a non-intrusive manner, and captures both steady-state and transient population dynamics, as well as the heterogeneity of the cluster. Additionally, the dispatch mechanism is included in the optimization, further improving the tracking performance. Finally, a hard-wired field trial has been conducted using 25 student refrigerators in dorm rooms on the UC Berkeley campus. The developed local control modules, communication platform and control methodology simultaneously address the aforementioned barriers. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Smart Grids 1. 2 Demand Response 1. 3 Flexible Appliances 1. 4 Challenges of Residential Demand Response 1. 5 Research Question and Objectives 1. 6 Scope of the Work, Outline and Main Contributions 2 Demand Response Simulator 2. 1 Agent Based Structure 2. 2 Demand Response Algorithms 2. 3 Demand Response Programs 2. 4 Data Models 2. 4. 1 Wet Appliances 2. 4. 2 Electric Vehicles 2. 4. 3 Electric Water Heaters 2. 4. 4 Household Load and PV Profiles 2. 5 Load Flow Calculations 2. 5. 1 Grid Topologies 2. 6 Communication Effects 2. 7 Conclusion 3 Local Voltage Control using Mixed Device Classes 3. 1 Related Work 3. 2 Pilot Architecture 3. 3 Droop Mechanism 3. 4 Simulation Scenario 3. 5 Simulation Results 3. 6 Conclusions 4 Cluster Control of Mixed Device Classes 4. 1 Three Step Approach 4. 1. 1 Step 1 : Aggregation 4. 1. 2 Step 2 : Optimization 4. 1. 3 Step 3 : Real-time Control 4. 2 Double Layered Control 4. 3 Simulation Scenario 4. 4 Simulation Results 4. 5 Conclusions 5 Data-driven Control: Accounting for Modelling Inaccuracies and Grid Congestions 5. 1 Markov Decision Processes 5. 2 Problem Formulation 5. 3 Model-based Reinforcement Learning 5. 4 Evaluation 5. 5 Conclusions 6 Rapid Algorithm Deployment Platform 6. 1 Introduction 6. 2 Algorithm Deployment Options 6. 3 Architecture Overview 6. 4 Hardware-in-the-loop Scenario 6. 5 Simulation Results and Measurements 6. 6 Conclusions 7 Cluster Control of Thermostatically Controlled Loads 7. 1 Introduction 7. 2 Related Work 7. 3 Three Step Approach 7. 3. 1 Step 1 : Aggregation 7. 3. 2 Step 2 : Optimization 7. 3. 3 Step 3 : Real-time Control 7. 4 Three Step Approach for TCLs 7. 4. 1 Step 1 : Aggregation 7. 4. 2 Step 2 : Optimization 7. 4. 3 Step 3 : Real-time Control 7. 5 Resultsnrpages: 166 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of {{urbanization}} {{has an impact}} on climate change and other environmental issues. Currently, 54 % of the global population lives in cities accounting for two-thirds of global energy demand. Sustainable energy generation and consumption is the top humanity’s problem for the next 50 years. Faced with rising urban population and the need to achieve energy efficiency, urban planners are focusing on sustainable, smart energy systems. This has {{led to the development of}} Smart Grids (SG) that employs intelligent monitoring, control and communication technologies to enhance efficiency, reliability and sustainability of power generation and distribution networks. While energy utilities are optimizing energy generation and distribution, consumers play a key role in sustainable energy usage. Several energy services are provided to the consumers to know households' hourly energy consumption, estimate monthly electricity cost and recommendations to reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, advanced services such as demand response, can now control and influence energy demand at the consumer-end to reduce the overall peak demand and re-shape demand profiles. The effectiveness and adoption of these services highly depend on the consumers’ awareness, their participation and engagement. Current energy services seldomly consider consumer preferences such as their daily behavior, comfort level and energy-consumption pattern. In this thesis, we investigate development of personalized energy services that strive to achieve a balance between efficient-energy consumption and user comfort. Personalization refers to tailoring energy services based on individual consumers’ characteristics, preferences and behavior. To develop effective personalized energy services a set of challenges need to be tackled. First, fine-grained data collection at user and appliance level is required (data collection challenge). Mechanisms should be devised to collect fine-grained data at various levels in a non-intrusive way with minimal sensors. Second, personalized energy services require detailed user preferences such as their <b>thermal</b> comfort level, <b>appliance</b> usage behavior and daily habits (user preference challenge). Accurate learning models to derive user preferences with minimal training and intrusion are required. Third, energy services developed needs to be easily scalable, from one household to tens and thousands of households (scalability challenge). Mechanisms should be developed to tackle the deluge of data and support distributed storage and processing. Fourth, energy services should deliver real-time feedback or recommendations so that users can promptly act upon it (real time challenge). This calls for development of distributed and low complexity algorithms. This thesis moves away from traditional SG services [...] which hardly consider consumer preferences and comfort [...] and proposes a novel approach to develop effective personalized energy services. The proposed energy services provide actionable feedback, raise awareness and promote energy-saving behavior among consumers. In this thesis, we follow a bottom-up data-driven methodology to develop personalized energy services at various scales [...] (i) nano: individual households, (ii) micro: buildings and spaces, and (iii) macro: neighborhoods and cities. To this end, we present our approach [...] physical analytics for sustainable, smart energy systems [...] that combines IoT data, physical modeling and data analytics to develop intelligent, personalized energy services. Physical analytics fuses data from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart meters, smart phones and smart watches, along with physical information such as household type, demographics and occupancy to infer energy-usage patterns, user behavior and discover hidden patterns. This approach is used to learn and model user preferences and energy usage, subsequently, employed to develop personalized energy services. This thesis is organized into three parts. Part I describes how to derive fine-grained information with minimal sensors and intrusion. We present two novel algorithms viz., LocED and PEAT that derive fine-grained information from appliance and user level, respectively. This real-time information is used to raise awareness on energy-usage behavior among occupants. Part II presents personalized energy services targeted at households and buildings. We develop services that shift and/or reduce energy consumption and cost by considering individual consumers’ preferences and comfort. These energy services are aimed at providing actionable feedback to occupants towards sustainable energy usage. Part III presents energy services targeted at neighborhood and city level. These energy services aim to identify target consumers in a neighborhood based on their energy-usage pattern and preferences for various DR programs. Finally, we present data-processing architectures that investigate how to cope with the overwhelming data generated from smart meters towards design and development of sustainable, smart energy systems. This thesis advocates that the design and development of energy services should follow personalized approach with consumer preferences and comfort given paramount importance. Results show that the personalized energy services developed has significant potential to raise awareness, reduce energy consumption and improve user comfort in smart [...] homes, buildings and neighborhoods.

40|$|Cooking is an {{integral}} part of each and every human being as food is one of the basic necessities for living. Commonly used sources of energy for cooking are firewood, crop residue, cow dung, kerosene, electricity, liqueﬁed petroleum gas(LPG), biogas etc. Half of the world’s population is exposed to indoor air pollution, mainly the result of burning solid fuels for cooking and heating. Wood cut for cooking purpose contributes tothe 16 million hectares(above 4 % of total area of India) of forest destroyed annually. The World Health Organization(WHO) reports that in 23 countries 10 % of deaths are due to just two environmental risk factors: unsafe water, including poor sanitation and hygiene; and indoor air pollution due to solid fuel usage for cooking. In under-developed countries, women have to walk 2 kms on average and spend significant amount of time for collecting the firewood for cooking. The cooking energy demand in rural areas of developing countries is largely met with bio-fuels such as fuel wood, charcoal, agricultural residues and dung cakes, whereas LPG or electricity is predominantly used in urban areas. India has abandon amount of solar energy in most of the regions making it most ideal place for harvesting solar energy. With almost 300 sunny days each year, one can confidently relay on this source of energy. India’s geographical location is in such a way that theoretically it receives 5 x 1015 kWh/ year of solar energy. Solar cooking is the simplest, safest, environmental friendly and most convenient way to cook. It is a blessing for those who cook using firewood or cow dung, who walk for miles to collect wood, who suffer from indoor air pollution. Hence solar cooking is going to play major role in solving future energy problem. Solar based cooking has never been a strong contender in the commercial market or even close to being a preferred method of cooking. They have been relegated to demonstration appliances to show case the solar based concepts. In this mode, cooking is no longer a time independent activity that can be performed at any time of day. One is forced to cook only at certain times when there is sufficient insolation. The geography of the cooking activity also shifts away from the kitchen. The kitchen is no longer the hearth of the home as the actual cooking activity shifts to the roof tops or high insolation platforms. This further adds to the inconvenience apart from being unable to cook at night or during cloudy conditions or during most of the winter days. Another issue of significant inconvenience is the general social structure in most families of the developing countries wherein the cooking activity is carried out by the senior ladies of the home. They are generally not athletic enough to be moving to and from the kitchen and the roof top to carry out the cooking exercise. As the solar cookers are enclosed spaces, interactive cooking is not possible let alone having any control on the rate of cooking. These are some of the more significant issues in the social psyche that has abundantly impeded the acceptance of solar <b>thermal</b> based cooking <b>appliances.</b> These issues and problems are in fact the motivating factors for this thesis. Based on these motivating factors, this thesis aims to propose solutions keeping the following points as the major constraints. cooking should be performed in the kitchen. one should be able to perform the cooking activity independent of the time of day or insolation. the cooking activity should be interactive the time taken for cooking should be comparable with the conventional methods in vogue. there should be a reduction in the use of conventional energy. Using the constraints and the motivating factors discussed above as the central theme, this thesis proposes a method to transfer solar thermal energy to the kitchen and act as a supplement to the conventional source of energy like the LPG or other sources that are traditionally being used in the households. The method proposed is in fact a hybrid scenario wherein the solar thermal is used to supplement the traditional source. Solar photovoltaic cells are also used to power the electronics and apparatus proposed in this thesis. This thesis addresses in detail the issues in analysis, modeling, designing and fabrication of the proposed hybrid solar cooking topology. The main goal of the proposed system is to transfer heat from sun to the cooking load that is located in the kitchen. The topology includes an additional feature for storing the energy in a buffer. The heat is first transferred from the solar thermal collector to a heat storage tank(that acts as the buffer) by circulating the heat transfer fluid at a specific flow rate that is controlled by a pump. The stored heat energy that is collected in the buffer is directed into the kitchen by circulating the heat transfer fluid into the heat exchanger, located in the kitchen. This is accomplished by controlling the flow rate using another pump. The solar thermal collector raises the temperature of the thermic fluid. The collector can be of a concentrating type in order to attain high temperatures for cooking. Concentrating collector like linear parabolic collector or parabolic dish collector is used to convert solar energy into heat energy. Absorption of energy from the incident solar insolation is optimized by varying the flow rate of circulating thermic fluid using a pump. This pump is energized from a set of photovoltaic panels(PV cell) which convert solar energy into electrical energy. The energy absorbed from the solar thermal collector is stored in a buffer tank which is thermally insulated. Whenever cooking has to be carried out, the high temperature fluid from the buffer tank is circulated through a heat exchanger that is located in the kitchen. The rate of cooking can be varied by controlling both the flow rate of fluid from the buffer tank to heat exchanger and also by controlling the amount of energy drawn from the auxiliary source. If the available stored energy is not sufficient, the auxiliary source of energy is used for cooking in order to ensure that cooking is in-dependent of time and solar insolation. In the proposed hybrid solar cooking system, the thesis addresses the issues involved in optimization of energy extracted from sun to storage tank and its subsequent transfer from the storage tank to the load. The flow rate at which maximum energy is extracted from sun depends on many parameters. Solar insolation is one of the predominant parameters that affect the optimum flow rate. Insolation at any location varies with time on a daily basis (diurnal variations) and also with day on a yearly basis(seasonal variation). This implies that the flow rate of the fluid has to be varied appropriately to maximize the energy absorbed from sun. In the proposed system, flow rate control plays a very significant role in maximizing the energy transfer from the collector to the load. The flow rate of the thermic fluid in the proposed system is very small on the order of 0. 02 kg/s. It is very difficult to sense such low flows without disrupting the operating point of the system. Though there are many techniques to measure very low flow rates, they invariably disrupt the system in which flow rate has to be measured. Further, the low flow sensors are far too expensive to be included in the system. A reliable, accurate and inexpensive flow measuring technique has been proposed in this thesis which is non-disruptive and uses a null-deflection technique. The proposed measuring method compensates the pressure drop across the flow meter using a compensating pump. The analysis, modeling, design and fabrication of this novel flow meter are addressed. The design and implementation of different subsystems that involves the selection and design of solar concentrating collector and tracking are explained. Finally, it is essential to know the economic viability of the proposed system that is designed and implemented. To understand the economics, the life cycle cost analysis of the proposed system is presented in this thesis. The major contributions of this thesis are: Energy transport: Major challenge in energy transport is to bring heat energy obtained from the sun to the kitchen for cooking. Energy transferred from solar insolation to the cooking load has to be optimized to maximize the overall efficiency. This can be split in to two parts,(a) optimizing efficiency of energy transferred from the collect or to the energy buffer tank,(b) optimizing efficiency of energy transferred from the buffer tank to the load. The optimization is performed by means of a maximum power point tracking(MPPT) algorithm for a specific performance index. Modeling of the cooking system: There are several domains that exist in the solar cooking system such as electrical domain, thermal domain, and hydraulic domain. The analysis of power/energy flow across all these domains presents a challenging task in developing a model of the hybrid cooking system. A bond graph modeling approach is used for developing the mathematical model of the proposed hybrid cooking system. The power/energy flow across different domains can be seamlessly integrated using the bond graph modeling approach. In this approach, the various physical variables in the multi-domain environment are uniformly de-fined as generalized power variables such as effort and flow. The fundamental principle of conservation of power/energy issued in describing the flow of power/energy across different domains and thus constructing the dynamic model of the cooking system. This model is validated through experimentation and simulation. Flow measurement: A novel method of low fluid mass flow measurement by compensating the pressure drop across the ends of measuring unit using a compensating pump has been proposed. The pressure drop due to flow is balanced by feedback control loop. This is a null-deflection type of measurement. As insertion of such a measuring unit does not affect the functioning of the systems, this is also a non-disruptive flow measurement method. This allows the measurement of very low flow rate at very low resolution. Implementation and design of such a unit are discussed. The system is modeled using bond graph technique and then simulated. The flow meter is fabricated and the model is experimentally validated. Design Toolbox: Design of hybrid cooking system involves design of multi domain systems. The design becomes much more complex if the energy source to operate the system is hybrid solar based. The energy budget has to be evaluated considering the worst case conditions for the availability of the solar energy. The design toolbox helps in assessing the user requirement and help designing the cooking system to fulfill the user requirement. A detailed toolbox is proposed to be developed that can be used in designing/selecting sub-systems like collector, concentrator, tracking system, buffer tank, heat exchanger, PV panel, batteries etc. The toolbox can also be used for performing life cycle costing...|$|R
