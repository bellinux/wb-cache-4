5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was {{visually}} similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, {{and access to the}} luggage boot (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front quarterlights, and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarterlights, extra <b>trim</b> <b>pads,</b> and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half shafts, steering box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|R

50|$|A padded {{roof was}} {{standard}} equipment on all Town Cars, with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim Town Cars, a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with center pillar coach lamps was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier <b>trims,</b> a <b>padded</b> vinyl coach roof (covering the rear {{half of the}} roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim Town Cars. On non-Cartier Town Cars, a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating {{the look of a}} convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.|$|R
5000|$|N. nouchali {{is used as}} an {{ornamental}} plant because of its spectacular flowers, and is most commonly used for the traditional and cultural festivals in Sri Lanka. It is also popular as an aquarium plant under the name [...] "dwarf lily" [...] or [...] "dwarf red lily". Sometimes, it is grown for its flowers, while other aquarists prefer to <b>trim</b> the lily <b>pads,</b> and just have the underwater foliage.|$|R
5000|$|The Gran Torino Brougham {{featured}} the finest upholsteries in the Torino line-up, including nylon cloth fabrics and [...] "leather like" [...] vinyl. Standard equipment included a {{front bench seat}} with a fold down armrest, woodgrained trim on the instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, electric clock, bright pedal <b>pad</b> <b>trim,</b> and a dual note horn. The Squire wagon was trimmed similarly to the Brougham. The comfortweave inserts were no longer offered in the Torino for 1973.|$|R
50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact bumpers {{mounted on}} self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment {{point of the}} strut, was redesigned to improve handling {{and stability in the}} event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel 5.5 in wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel <b>trim</b> and a <b>padded</b> steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|R
2500|$|People {{who choose}} to treat navicular disease through shoeing may use a shoe {{designed}} to lift and support the heels. [...] This can sometimes be accomplished with a flat shoe and <b>trimming</b> alone. Wedge <b>pads</b> or wedged shoes are often used, but can amplify heel-related problems if present. Another strategy {{is to use a}} bar type shoe. Often, an egg-bar shoe, or straight bar shoe. [...] Some horses benefit from shoes that change the breakover of their foot (like a rolled toe). With or without shoes, the hoof must be trimmed {{in such a way as}} to restore the balance and angle that may have been lost. Horses with long toe-low heel conformation need careful trimming to counter this. Horses with upright feet may need their heels lowered and a shoe that will allow their heels to spread. Early intervention is key; in one study, shoeing was successful in 97% of horses treated within ten months of the onset of signs, while only 54% of horses lame for over a year responded.|$|R
2500|$|Recently one of El Santo's 25 grandchildren {{made his}} {{professional}} debut. After gaining some seasoning under different identities, {{he began working}} as [...] "El Nieto del Santo" [...] (Spanish for [...] "the Grandson of Santo"). El Hijo del Santo took legal actions to prevent this as he owns all [...] "El Santo" [...] rights {{when it comes to}} wrestling, presumably because he himself is planning on letting one of his own sons use the [...] "El Nieto del Santo" [...] name. These days, the grandson of El Santo works as [...] "Axxel" [...] and only uses [...] "El Nieto del Santo" [...] as an unofficial nickname to avoid any legal issues. Axxel uses the same trademark mask, cape and trunk design as El Santo but has incorporated black <b>trim</b> and knee <b>pads,</b> presumably not to infringe on the legal rights of El Hijo del Santo. In August 2012, a court ruled in favor of Axxel, allowing him to again begin working as El Nieto del Santo. In July 2016, another one of El Santo's grandchildren and the son of El Hijo del Santo began working under the name [...] "El Santo Jr." [...] On September 23, 2016 to honor the 99th birthday of El Santo, Google Doodle ran a special El Santo Google doodle for that day.|$|R
