I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

2500|$|Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura {{expressed}} {{his support for}} the movement and attended an Occupy protest in Minneapolis. He also stated his belief that the movement should not be dictated by either party, stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be the face of this movement; it can't be a Democrat or a Republican because not only do I talk the talk I walk the walk. I never took one dollar of corporate money. I never took one PAC dollar to become governor of Minnesota." [...] He also went on saying that both the Democrats and Republicans, both parties of which Ventura is known for being a staunch critic of, had [...] "sold themselves out to Wall Street." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come {{to abolish}} the Law or the Prophets; I have not come {{to abolish the}}m but to fulfill them.

Anyone who breaks {{one of the least}} of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." ...|$|E

He also performed it again on his third appearance on Stage Show on March 17, and again on the Milton Berle Show on April 3. On July 1, Steve Allen introduced Presley on The Steve Allen Show, and Presley, dressed in formal evening wear, said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> on something tonight that's not quite right for evening wear." [...] Allen asked, [...] "What's that, Elvis?" [...] "Blue suede shoes" [...] was the answer, as he lifted his left foot to show the audience.

In an {{interview}} with Matsuoka on the similarities {{between him and his}} character, the voice actor opinioned that [...] "I'm thinking about our workplaces – in both of our workplaces, there's only one chance , so there's {{a lot of people who}} are putting in their all. I always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do the best acting I can for the sake of those who came to see me or watch the show. I feel like I have to pull along people with my acting. I feel like, I have to pave the way for the others." [...] Many fans have asked Reki Kawahara whether there would be an eventual crossover between Accel World and Sword Art Online, to which he answered that while he had already written a scenario where Kirito and Haruyuki Arita meet and fight, such a prospect would be difficult due to SAO taking place in 2022 and Accel World in 2046.|$|E
2500|$|Lone Wolf {{was one of}} {{the first}} Indian artists to paint other Indians, and Indian subjects. He was also one of the first Indian artists to be academically trained in art. [...] He was known for both his {{painting}} and sculpting skills. He played a [...] "significant role" [...] in capturing the events of the American West during the latter part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s. He had personal experience, as well as his tribe's personal knowledge of people and events. He was the first Indian to achieve national recognition as an artist, creating over 500 paintings. He was influenced and encouraged by Thomas Moran, who he met during his time wrangling at the Grand Canyon, and his style has been compared to that of Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell. Russell also encouraged and instructed Lone Wolf in his early career. Lone Wolf had his first solo show in Los Angeles in 1917. The headline in the Los Angeles Times about the exhibition read, [...] "Vance Thompson Discovers Wonderful Indian Artist, An Artist With a Vision." [...] In that article, Vance Thompson said of Lone Wolf, [...] "The message he has to give is his own; and already he has shaped – if he has not perfected – a distinct, individual and interesting technique." [...] He went to say, [...] "It is a rare thing to discover an artist. I have seen the young painters pass in droves through the schools and salons of Paris, and in 20 years I can claim to have been the discoverer of only one great artist. Now I like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> at last, discovered another and he is an artist who has authentic vision, sincerity and a brush which is already capable of doing precisely the thing he wants it to..." ...|$|E
