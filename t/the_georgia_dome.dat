5|$|It was {{the first}} time since the 1996 postseason that the home team won both of the conference {{championship}} games. The Colts were the first dome team to win the Super Bowl in an outdoor game (the St. Louis Rams were the first dome team to win a Super Bowl, XXXIV inside <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta). The 2006 Indianapolis Colts were the first division champion to win a Super Bowl with four postseason wins and the second division champion (2003 Carolina Panthers) to win a conference title with three postseason wins.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the most}} cited criticisms about the stadium are the four catwalks that {{hang from the}} ceiling. The catwalks {{are part of the}} dome's support structure. The stadium was built with {{cable-stayed}} technology similar to that of <b>the</b> defunct <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> It also supports the lighting and speaker systems. Because the dome is tilted toward the outfield, the catwalks are lower in the outfield.|$|R

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies (10-3), led by redshirt {{freshman}} running back Ryan Williams and Junior Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, met in Atlanta with the Tennessee Volunteers (7-6) at <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> {{to end their}} season right where it had begun against Alabama, who would win the National Championship a week later. Williams, who had only moved to number 1 on the depth charts when Darren Evans was injured in the offseason, was looking for 109 yards rushing to pass Kevin Jones’ school-record of 1,647 set in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In Albrecht's {{role with}} the 2012–13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 {{points in a}} game before the NCAA Tournament.

5|$|On July 7, 2011, {{officials}} from both Alabama and Virginia Tech announced the Crimson Tide and the Hokies would meet {{to open the}} 2013 season in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game at Atlanta. In the game, the offense struggled, but Christion Jones became the first Alabama player to score two non-offensive touchdowns in a single game and led the Crimson Tide to a 35–10 victory at <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> After the Hokies were held to a three-and-out, Christion Jones gave Alabama a 7–0 lead with his first touchdown on a 72-yard punt return.

5000|$|In 1992, former Wheeler head {{football}} coach Corky Kell helped create the High School Football Classic in <b>the</b> newly built <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> From 1992 to 2016 (with {{a few years of}} alternating locations), games were played in <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta. <b>The</b> games were played in the dome every year except in 1995, 1997, and 2014 when they were played at McEachern High School.|$|R

5|$|The Hokies went 10-4 in 2008, {{concluding}} {{the season}} with a 20-7 win in the 2009 Orange Bowl. Before the 2009 season started, Virginia Tech accepted an invitation to play Alabama in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, a game organized by the Chick-fil-A Bowl to pit two high-profile teams against each other to create a bowl game-like atmosphere in <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> {{at the start of the}} season. Virginia Tech was ranked No. 7 in the preseason polls, while Alabama was No. 5; the game was forecast as a competition between two possible national championship contenders. Alabama defeated Virginia Tech 34-24 and ultimately went on to win the national championship.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a run after the catch (the first catch going for 38yards and the second going for 47yards, both over the middle) displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies at <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome</b> in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange {{for the right to}} pick the first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million.

25|$|On June 2, 1999, the Backstreet Boys {{embarked}} on the Into the Millennium Tour, which comprised 115 sold-out shows in 84 cities, with some additional dates put {{due to high}} demand.

5000|$|Developer Legacy's stated {{goals were}} {{to create a}} {{district}} within Downtown Atlanta that would contain entertainment, hotel accommodations and restaurants all {{within walking distance of}} each other and of <b>the</b> nearby <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> Philips Arena, <b>Georgia</b> World Congress Center, CNN Center, World of Coca-Cola and Georgia Aquarium. It would lure visitors to stay, dine, and be entertained near those facilities and attractions instead of in the Peachtree Center area of Downtown or even Buckhead. Whereas a few years prior, few facilities existed in the area, by 2011, the district counted 25 restaurants and 6 hotels, the Ventana events center and a helipad. The area is set to add the College Football Hall of Fame and Times Square South to its roster of attractions.|$|R
50|$|On May 31, 2006, Old Dominion University {{announced}} that it would start a football team to begin play in 2009. ODU joined the CAA football conference in 2011.

The team is playing in <b>the</b> 70,000 seat <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> but is restricting ticket sales to just over 28,000 for virtually all its games. However, GSU played only the 2012 season in the CAA, and was not eligible for the conference title, as it began an FBS transition in advance of its 2013 move to the Sun Belt Conference.|$|R
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome,</b> Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but that figure {{was based on}} the number of tickets sold rather than actual turnstile attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia {{for the final}} phase. Wenham and his team {{transformed}} a defunct train yard into an abandoned auto plant used by the protagonists as their headquarters. Redesigning the train yard took place over several months. It was required to allow enough space for stunt drivers to drive into the building, {{and it had to}} include an integrated lighting system. The design team removed walls, hauled out old railway cars, suspended rusted car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in the rafters of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set. An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> <b>Dome.</b> The train heist scene was filmed in Rice, California over three weeks.|$|E
