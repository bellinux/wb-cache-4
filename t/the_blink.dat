5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into <b>the</b> <b>Blink</b> sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study stochastically {{blinking}} dynamical {{systems as}} in the companion paper (Part I). We analyze the asymptotic properties of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> system as time goes to infinity. The trajectories of <b>the</b> averaged and <b>blinking</b> system cannot stick together forever, but the trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> system may converge to an attractor of the averaged system. There are four distinct classes of blinking dynamical systems. Two properties differentiate them: single or multiple attractors of the averaged system and their invariance or noninvariance under the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> system. In <b>the</b> case of invariance, we prove that the trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> system converge to the attractor(s) of the averaged system with high probability if switching is fast. In the noninvariant single attractor case, the trajectories reach a neighborhood of the attractor rapidly and remain close {{most of the time}} with high probability when switching is fast. In the noninvariant multiple attractor case, the trajectory may escape to another attractor with small probability. Using the Lyapunov function method, we derive explicit bounds for these probabilities. Each of the four cases is illustrated by a specific example of a blinking dynamical system. From a probability theory perspective, our results are obtained by directly deriving large deviation bounds. They are more conservative than those derived by using the action functional approach, but they are explicit in the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> system...|$|R

25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina.

If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within {{a fraction of a}} second, literally faster than <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> of an eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a system that}} uses patterns of eye blinks as a biometric. Each user chooses a personal blink pattern based on a song (for example “Jingle Bells”). To establish their identity, the user looks at the system’s camera and <b>blinks</b> to <b>the</b> cadence of their chosen song. Computer vision is used to detect <b>the</b> <b>blinks</b> and to compare <b>the</b> <b>blinked</b> cadence to a database of stored blinked patterns to determine which song is being blinked, and therefore which user is performing <b>the</b> <b>blinking.</b> To make <b>the</b> system more secure, the system compares the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> itself, <b>the</b> “blinkprint”, to the user’s stored blinkprint. This provides a verification check to help protect against the theft and subsequent use of a user’s blink pattern. We discuss the possible use of an enrollment process that alerts new users when their new blink code is similar to other codes already in the database, and report {{on the results of}} a preliminary experiment using this new enrollment procedure. ...|$|R
30|$|Recently, Hohng and Ha {{reported}} a blinking suppression in solutions of quantum dots [73]. When the individual streptavidin-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were exposed in solution to β-mercaptoethanol, their blinking essentially disappeared and constant radiative emission was observed. The authors determined that only thiol-containing species with short chain lengths {{were able to}} suppress <b>the</b> quantum dot <b>blinking.</b> Since thiols are effective electron donors, the authors argued that these ligands donate electrons to fill surface traps. This deactivates <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> mechanism, and leads to a more constant emission. Tinnefeld and co-workers soon after reported similar blinking suppression using mercaptoethylamine but interpreted their observations as {{a dramatic increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> kinetics [77].

25|$|Removing {{contact lenses}} {{incorrectly}} {{could result in}} damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins {{against the edge of}} lens allows <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.|$|E
