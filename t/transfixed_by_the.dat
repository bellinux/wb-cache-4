5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his second}} film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, {{about a man who}} leaves his family after he is <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smile of a waitress.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} Spain in 2000, he became <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bush v. Gore case and began {{thinking}} about the letter he had received from Robert F. Kennedy, which he had kept because it inspired him. Re-reading the letter, he was again inspired, reminded that lawyers can have a role beyond construction-defect cases.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Jung {{along with}} Chinese actors Francis Ng and Chang Chen, {{directed}} three short films for Three Charmed Lives, an omnibus {{commissioned by the}} Hong Kong International Film Festival. Critics praised Jung's short The Killer Behind the Old Man as the strongest and most stylish entry. In it, a son hires an ultra-methodical hitman (played by Andy Choi) to assassinate his own father, but the killer however finds himself <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> man's slow-moving and ordered life, and thus hesitates to carry through with his mission.|$|E
50|$|While I was {{photographing the}} bodies, a little ten-year-old girl came {{running up and}} stood <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> one of <b>the</b> dead. The woman was her older sister. The child had never before seen death and couldn't {{understand}} why her sister would not speak to her...|$|R
60|$|However, that's neither here nor there, just now. She {{went home}} to breakfast, and had {{scarcely}} caught the full flavour of her first sip of tea, when the servant announced a gentleman, whereat Miss La Creevy, at once imagining a new sitter <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> admiration at <b>the</b> street-door case, was in unspeakable consternation at {{the presence of the}} tea-things.|$|R
60|$|The {{watching}} {{girl was}} <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> astonishment at <b>the</b> {{ease with which}} the crouching man eluded the great paws. And now, O Allah! He had rushed in behind EL ADREA'S shoulder even before the beast could turn, and had grasped him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mane. The lion reared upon his hind legs like a horse--Tarzan had known {{that he would do}} this, and he was ready. A giant arm encircled the black-maned throat, and once, twice, a dozen times a sharp blade darted {{in and out of the}} bay-black side behind the left shoulder.|$|R
500|$|Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources {{gave the}} issue 3 stars out of 5 saying, the issue [...] "doesn't {{do much to}} advance the agenda or tighten up the plotlines of [...] "Trinity War", but there is {{absolutely}} no question that the developments in this issue are going to have lasting ramifications for the Phantom Stranger and his quest for redemption." [...] Newsarama's Richard Gray gave it an 8 out 10 saying [...] "Some will pick up this issue for the links to the current “Trinity War” arc, but all should be <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way J.M.

500|$|Contrasting {{with his}} June olives with their blue-green color and coolness of tone, the vibrant oranges and yellows in Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun (F710) evoke the fall season. [...] Novelist Warren Keith Wright visited this {{painting}} at the Minneapolis Institute of Art over a 15-year period, <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> painting, but unsure why. [...] He {{came to realize}} that the fascination was that the painting represented two periods of time. [...] The late-afternoon sun lies due west above the mountains. [...] The shadows, though, slant from the left, or the southwest, where they would fall in autumn. [...] Not only is the painting out of sync with time, it is also out of sync with the season. [...] It [...] "predicts its own future, reverts to its own past." ...|$|E

His dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on October 19, 1899. The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs.

6000|$|Gonsalvo {{accepted}} the devoted offer, mounted the horse, {{and had made}} but few paces when a lamentable cry caused him to turn his head, and he beheld <b>the</b> faithful Mendoza <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> Moorish lances. <b>The</b> four principal cavaliers already named, with several of their followers, effected their retreat and reached the camp in safety; but this nocturnal reverse obscured the morning's triumph. Gonsalvo remembered the last words of the devoted Mendoza, and bestowed a pension on his widow and marriage portions on his daughters.* ...|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{striking}} object in the relief is the item of jewelry that Hegeso appears to be pulling from the pyxis, since both she and her maidservant seem almost <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> it. <b>The</b> {{fact that it is}} missing now only makes one focus more on the empty space and wonder what it actually looked like or may have represented. However, the artist was most likely not attempting {{to draw attention to the}} piece of jewelry, but rather the act of adornment itself. He would have wanted to express a purely domestic scene of Hegeso, a typical Athenian lady, dressing to go out or receive guests (not to leave the household permanently in death, as one may want to sentimentally interpret it).|$|R
2500|$|In 1935 Nakagawa {{accompanied}} Katsube Roshi to lead {{a weekend}} retreat for Tokyo Imperial University students, and realized he forgot the kyosaku (Zen stick). In search of a replacement stick Soen went to a nearby Zen center, Hakusan Dojo, where he heard Myoshin-ji Zen master Gempo Yamamoto speaking. Soen became <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> talk and intrigued by the man. Soen {{would return to the}} dojo several times after this encounter. One day, Gempo stated: ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{keyboard}} player, Jenny toured with Perry Farrell's new band, The Satellite Party, also {{appearing in}} this capacity on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius Satellite Radio (on June 5, 2007). On the show, Satellite Party played a Jane's Addiction song, [...] "Been Caught Stealing" [...] - and Artie Lange (the show's comedian) and Howard Stern were <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> her at <b>the</b> keyboards, with Jenny agreeing to {{a date with}} Artie upon her return from touring in Europe. She and Satellite Party also filmed a performance for the Late Show with David Letterman which aired that same night.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{was one of}} many done for surrealist patron and Magritte supporter Edward James. This was the second painting delivered to James for his London ballroom. The first was the portrait of James, Not to be Reproduced.

60|$|At last, {{when the}} ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep {{darkness}} that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; <b>the</b> watch--then headed <b>by</b> Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> listening, like <b>the</b> carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest mariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.|$|R
60|$|Girty and Deering {{stood before}} the poor, {{stricken}} girl, and gloated over her fair beauty. She stood as when first <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> horror from which she had been fleeing. Her pale face was lowered, her hands clenched tightly {{in the folds of}} her skirt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do,' said Lucilla, running lightly up, {{and dancing}} into the drawing-room, where the ladies {{were so much}} at their ease, on low couches and ottomans, that Phoebe stood <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> novelty of a drawing-room treated with such freedom as was seldom {{permitted}} in even the schoolroom at Beauchamp, when Miss Fennimore was in presence.|$|E

5000|$|Guests {{included}} Bob Hope, Arthur Godfrey and pianist Peter Nero. During the 1950s, when nightclub venues {{were numerous}} throughout the nation, {{two of the}} most prominent in the country were Beverly Hills and the Lookout House, in the Northern Kentucky area of [...] "Greater Cincinnati." [...] Virtually every headliner, including Jack E. Leonard, Nelson Eddy, Ted Lewis, Pearl Bailey, Myron Cohen, and many others, appeared on Ruth Lyons' program. [...] One of Ruth's favorites, the popular singer, Don Cornell, regularly appeared in the area, and even served as substitute host for the show during her occasional absences. David Letterman and Phil Donahue, both appeared on her show. Letterman appeared when Lyons' sidekick, Bob Braun, hosted the show in the 70s. In an audio biography of Ruth Lyons, called [...] "Let Me Entertain You--A Ruth Lyons Memoir CD;" [...] Letterman tells how his mother, who never turned on a TV during <b>the</b> daytime, was <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> it when <b>The</b> 50/50 Club was on.|$|R

60|$|Trusting {{to their}} {{somewhat}} superior numbers the Arab horsemen advanced to meet them; but Jethro's party, obeying his orders {{to keep in}} a close line together with their spears leveled in front of them, rode right over the Arabs, who came up singly and without order. Men and horses rolled over together, several of the former <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spears of the horsemen. Jethro called upon his men to halt and turned upon the Arabs.|$|E
60|$|His gaze seemed impelled {{and held}} by things afar--the great yellow-and-purple {{corrugated}} world of distance, {{now on a}} level with his eyes. He was drawn by the beauty and the grandeur of that scene and <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> realization that he had dared to venture {{to find a way}} through this vast, wild, and upflung fastness. He kept looking afar, sweeping the three-quartered circle of horizon till his judgment of distance was confounded and his sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next. Then he withdrew his fascinated gaze to adopt the Indian's method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert--to look with slow, contracted eyes from near to far.|$|E
60|$|While speaking, the Leather-Stocking was poising and {{directing}} his weapon. Elizabeth saw the bright, polished tines, as they slowly and silently entered the water, where the refraction pointed them many {{degrees from the}} true direction of the fish; and she thought that the intended victim saw them also, as he seemed to increase the play of his tail and fins, though without moving his station. At the next instant the tall body of Natty bent to the water’s edge, and the handle of his spear disappeared in the lake. The long, dark streak of the gliding weapon, and the little bubbling vortex which followed its rapid flight, were easily to be seen: {{but it was not}} until the handle snot again into the air by its own reaction, and its master catching it in his hand, threw its tines uppermost, that Elizabeth was acquainted with the success of the blow. A fish of great size was <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> barbed steel, and was very soon shaken from its impaled situation into the bottom of the canoe.|$|E

Overpowered with watching and exertion, I had closed my eyes for a few minutes, when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder. I awoke instantly. He had raised himself up, so as to seat himself in bed--a dreadful change had come over his face, but consciousness had returned, for he evidently knew me. The child, who had been long since disturbed by his ravings, rose from its little bed, and ran towards its father, screaming with fright--the mother hastily caught it in her arms, lest he should injure it in the violence of his insanity; but, terrified by the alteration of his features, stood <b>transfixed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bedside. He grasped my shoulder convulsively, and, striking his breast with the other hand, made a desperate attempt to articulate. It was unavailing; he extended his arm towards them, and made another violent effort. There was a rattling noise in the throat--a glare of the eye--a short stifled groan--and he fell back--dead!' ...|$|E
