However, the injury did not hamper him as he continued {{the pattern of the}} regular season, his performances in the 2006 NCAA Tournament improved with every passing game as #4 seed LSU advanced to their first Final Four since 1986. His minutes were somewhat limited by the injury in the first round game against No. 13 seed Iona and the second round game against No. 12 seed Texas A&M but he was back to form by LSU's <b>Atlanta</b> <b>Regional</b> semi-final (Sweet 16) matchup against perennial power and overall top seed Duke. In the Duke game, Thomas recorded 9 points, 13 rebounds and 5 blocks despite being limited to 25 minutes due to early foul trouble as LSU held Duke to a 27.7 percent field goal percentage and only 54 points, the school's lowest output since 1996. Thomas was even more dominant in the Regional Final (Elite Eight) win against No. 2 seed Texas, recording 21 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks.

50|$|In {{the field}} of English education, a field now often {{referred}} to as English Language Arts in which HEL is often required, the position of history of the English language is tenuous: it is not universally acknowledged that elementary and high-school students need to be taught anything about the subject. James Ney, a linguist at Arizona State University, argues that the shift in contemporary linguistics toward transformational grammar has taken attention away from historical linguistics. Ney's study of high-school textbooks suggested that history of English only takes up a minute amount of coverage; if it is there at all, it pertains to etymology and dictionary usage. Though some curriculum proposals (some of which very ambitious; Ney singles out <b>the</b> 1968 <b>Atlanta</b> <b>Regional</b> Curriculum Project) did promote a more rigorous study of the subject in elementary and high school, no discernible impact seems to have been made on actual school curricula.|$|R
