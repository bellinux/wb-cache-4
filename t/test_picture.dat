40|$|Boundary {{extension}} (BE) is {{a rapidly}} occurring memory error {{in which participants}} incorrectly remember having seen {{beyond the boundaries of}} a view. However, behavioral data has provided no insight into how quickly after the onset of a <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> the effect is detected. To determine the time course of BE from neural responses we conducted a BE experiment while recording EEG. We exploited a diagnostic response asymmetry to mismatched views (a closer and wider view of the same scene) in which the same pair of views is rated as more similar when the closer item is shown first than vice versa. On each trial, a closer or wider view was presented for 250  ms followed by a 250 -ms mask and either the identical view or a mismatched view. Boundary ratings replicated the typical asymmetry. We found a similar asymmetry in ERP responses in the 265 - 285  ms interval where the second member of the close-then-wide pairs evoked less negative responses at left parieto-temporal sites compared to the wide-then-close condition. We also found diagnostic ERP effects in the 500 - 560  ms range, where ERPs to wide-then-close pairs were more positive at centro-parietal sites than in the other three conditions, which is thought to be related to participants' confidence in their perceptual decision. The ERP effect in the 265 - 285  ms range suggests the falsely remembered region beyond the view-boundaries of S 1 is rapidly available and impacts assessment of the <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> within the first 265  ms of viewing, suggesting that extrapolated scene structure may be computed rapidly enough {{to play a role in}} the integration of successive views during visual scanning...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{use of a}} {{flexible}} or rigid fiberoptic bronchoscope belongs to the standard repertoire in anesthesiology. Besides a lack of training these procedures may be considerably compromised by endoscopic lens fogging. Several antifogging approaches are commercially available but to date no controlled studies regarding the efficacy of these devices in bronchoscopes exists. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the efficacy of different commercially available anti-fogging techniques for rigid and flexible bronchoscopes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed at the department of anesthesia in a university children's hospital. An artificial airway model was created to simulate in vivo conditions with respect to airflow, temperature and atmospheric moisture. A <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> was inserted into the artificial airway for assuring a standardized view through the bronchoscopes. Antifogging efficacy of two liquid antifog solutions (Ultrastop and Anti-Fog), two antifog wipes (Lina Clear and Reso Clear) and an induction endoscope preheater system (used after one and two induction preheating phases) was assessed by video taping of the bronchoscope view of the <b>test</b> <b>picture.</b> In addition the administration of continuous oxygen airflow of 2 l min⁻¹ through the suction channel of the flexible bronchoscope was tested as an alternative method to prevent lens fogging. All final pictures were rated by 10 staff anesthesiologists who were blinded to the antifog devices used. To assess the clinical relevance of the results, ratings were classified into a 5 grade rating scale (ranging from no visualization of any structure to excellent endoscopic view allowing safe endotracheal intubation). In addition, the failure rate of each anti-fog technique was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 300 endoscopic test pictures were taken and assessed. Using the flexible bronchoscope, the use of anti-fog solution (failure rate 3...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Geotechnical {{centrifuges}} can {{simulate the}} behavior of soil material, with a high accuracy. One of the main aspects of centrifuge tests is sample monitoring during the <b>test.</b> <b>Picture</b> transfer is a useful way of gaining data from the sample. In this study, a vertical nailed slope was tested. Its side wall is meshed by target points and lines. The displacements of the points and deformation of the target lines are continually monitored. By triangulation of the points with an assumption of a linear displacement field, the magnitude of shear strain was calculated.

40|$|Mere {{exposure}} {{effect and}} fluency 2 In three experiments, picture quality between test items was manipulated {{to examine whether}} subjects ’ expectations about the fluency normally associated with these different stimuli might influence the effects of fluency on preference or familiarity-based recognition responses. The results showed that fluency due to pre-exposure influenced responses less when objects were presented with high picture quality, suggesting that attributions of fluency to preference and familiarity are adjusted according to expectations about the different test pictures. However, this expectations influence depended on subjects ’ awareness of these different quality levels. Indeed, imperceptible differences seemed not induce expectations about the test items fluency. In this context, fluency due to both picture quality and pre-exposure influenced directly responses. Conversely, obvious, and noticed, differences in <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> quality did no affect responses, suggesting that expectations moderated attributions of fluency only when fluency normally associated with these different stimuli was perceptible but difficult to assess...|$|E

This is sufficient to show a proof of concept of combining the JND approach with JPEG-LS. JPEG-LS is a widely used and relatively simple coding mechanism for lossless and near-lossless image compression. The JND measurement will be defined, implemented and integrated into JPEG-LS. Therefore a modified approach of [CL 95] will be used. The quantization step size (QSS) will be adapted dynamically according to the JND value so that the compression ratio compared to a standard JPEG-LS implementation can be improved. By that, a near-lossless variable bit-rate (VBR) is introduced into the coding flow. The encoder and decoder are implemented in MATLAB and after defining the visual quality criteria the results are evaluated and analysed in matter of compression quality and performance.

Given a training set of view exemplars, we learn and select appearance-based discriminative parts which are mapped onto the 3 D model from the training set through a facil- ity location optimization. The training set of 3 D models is summarized into a sparse set of shapes from which we can generalize by linear combination. Given a <b>test</b> <b>picture,</b> we detect hypotheses for each part. The main challenge is to select from these hypotheses and compute the 3 D pose and shape coefficients at the same time. To achieve this, we optimize a function that minimizes simultaneously the geometric reprojection error {{as well as the}} appearance matching of the parts. We apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to minimize the resulting convex function. We evaluate our approach on the Fine Grained 3 D Car dataset with superior performance in shape and pose errors.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a test of}} the notion of semantic integration of information in pictures. In Experiment I, subjects were presented pictures which comprised various subsets of the elements in one of four standard pictures. In the test phase, recognition confidence for old and new items was a direct function of the number of figures in the <b>test</b> <b>picture.</b> However, recognition confidence was significantly higher for old than for new pictures, contrary to predictions of the integration model of Bransford and Franks (1971). In Experiment 2, the differential predictions of the integration model and the tally model tfleitman & Bower, 19731 were tested. The information for a key standard picture was presented solely as ONEs during acquisition. For the other three standard pictures, information was presented as ONEs, TWOs, and THREEs. The results were that recognition confidence increased with complexity of the test item with regular items but decreased with increasing complexity with key items. Together, these experiments support the tally model and demonstrate the generalizability of this model to handle pictorial materials. Implications regarding the nature of picture memory are also discussed. Until recently, the notion of semantic integration of information in memory has been largely associated with processing verbal materials (e. g., Barclay, 1973...|$|E

This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effect of an intervention strategy that was incorporated into shared storybook reading on the production of graphic symbol combinations. Three {{children between the ages}} of 7; 9 (years;months) and 10; 8 with limited speech and physical impairments participated in the study. A multiple probe design across behaviours (3 different types of semantic symbol combinations) was used, replicated across the 3 participants. Intervention entailed prompting the production of strategic symbol combinations (generated from a matrix) during shared storybook reading by using a prompting hierarchy. The participants’ production of combinations targeted during intervention as well as their ability to generalize to nontarget combinations from the matrix was monitored using a probe <b>test</b> (<b>picture</b> description task). All 3 participants showed some gains in acquiring the combinations and generalizing to nontarget combinations, as measured by the probe test. While 1 participant showed convincing effects, the other 2 showed lower effects. Lower effects may be partly ascribed to participant characteristics as well as to the discrepancies between the intervention and probe contexts. All participants performed better within the shared storybook reading context. Results suggest that the production of symbol combinations can be facilitated during shared storybook reading and that the matrix strategy promotes generalization to untrained semantic combinations. However, participant gains may not reflect immediately in formal testing situations. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

We aimed {{to develop a new}} screening method to discriminate between normal and mild cognitive functioning in older subjects. Methods: Based on the literature, we selected several test-items related to the diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV) for dementia. This new composed instrument for Screening Cognitive Functions (SCOF) is a brief, 15 -minutes approach with questions on orientation, serial attention test, recall of five words, clockdrawmg, language comprehension and reading, word fluency test, visual design reproduction, alternating sequences <b>test,</b> <b>picture</b> arrangement test, and overlapping figure test. The SCOF, MMSE, and complete neuropsychological examination (NPE) was administered, in random order, to 20 patients (mean age 78 ï¿½ 6 yrs) admitted to the Dept. of Geriatric Medicine. Results: After deleting one question about orientation (which season), the internal consistancy of the SCOF was 0. 80 (chronbach's alpha). Based on the NPE, we divided the subjects in 3 groups: mild (35 %), moderate (60 %) and serious cognitive impairrment (5 %). The SCOF detected significantly (p< 0. 05) better mild cognitive impairment than the MMSE (cut off point was 24).

40|$|These studies {{ask whether}} S remembers a picture better {{the greater the}} "depth of {{processing}} " he allots to it. Depth of processing pictures of faces was varied according to judgments of sex ("superficial") or judgments of likableness or honesty of the person pictured. Performance on a later recognition memory test was high for pictures judged for likableness or honesty, and low for pictures judged for sex. This ordering held as'true for intentional learners as for incidental learners. A final experiment showed that face recognition memory was not materially affected by a context manipulation: an old <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> was remembered at a level determined by its original depth of processing and independently of how it was tested—either alone, along side an old picture it had been studied with, or with a new picture. In a recent paper, Craik and Lockhart (1972) argued that "depth of processing" of stimulus material is a direct determinant of how well that material will be remem-bered. The underlying assumption in their approach is that a stimulus is processed {{through a series of}} stages with different kinds of information being extracted from or triggered off by the stimulus at suc-cessive stages. Sensory features of the stimulus are presumably extracted first, whereas associative information (such as the name or meaning of a grapheme) be-comes available later. In support of their depth of processing hypothesis, Craik and Lockhart review studies showing higher incidental learning for words which 5 s had processed for meaning than for items proc-essed for physical attributes. For instance, Hyde and Jenkins (1969) oriented 5 s to answer different questions with respect to a word, either counting the number of letters in it or the number of es, or rating it for pleasantness. Those 5 s who did the pleasantness judgments recalled the words later much better than did the other 5 s. Similarly, Johnston and Jenkins (1971) showed that 5 s required to thin...|$|E

We tested 73 community-based patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy controls for a semantic memory assessment (tests of: category fluency; picture naming; naming-to-description; sorting; and word-picture matching). We used bootstrap ANCOVA (covarying age, NART IQ and education) and bootstrap regression techniques to analyse the data. These relatively well-preserved patients performed within the normal range on some semantic <b>tests</b> (<b>picture</b> naming, picture sorting and word-picture matching), but were impaired on others (category fluency and naming-to-description). Negative symptoms {{were inversely related to}} picture sorting, word-picture matching and a composite measure of all five semantic tests. By contrast, positive symptoms correlated positively only with category fluency i. e. better fluency with more positive symptoms. The results indicated that semantic memory deficits in community-based patients were small to moderate and certainly not common across all tasks. Finally, semantic memory impairment was more strongly linked to negative than positive symptomatology. ?? 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|James E. Hoffman, PhDEmotionally charged stimuli swiftly grab our {{attention}} {{even when we}} are deeply engrossed in other activities. This is readily apparent in a laboratory phenomenon known as “emotion induced blindness” or EIB. EIB occurs when people search a rapidly presented (RSVP) stream of scene pictures for a target picture, for example, a picture outlined in red. These targets become virtually undetectable when an irrelevant distractor picture containing negative emotional content precedes the target picture by about two tenths of a second. Longer intervals between the distractor and target restore detection to normal levels. What causes this brief period of blindness? According to one theory, the emotional distractor doesn’t affect the perceptual or semantic processing of the target but only interferes with late processes responsible for awareness, similar to other observed attention capturing phenomena. A competing theory holds that emotional pictures are special and suppress early perceptual processing of the target. The late-interference theory predicts that people should have full “knowledge” {{about the meaning of}} the target picture even when they are unaware of it, while the early-interference theory predicts that both perceptual and semantic information about the target is suppressed. These predictions were tested using EEG to measure the electrical activity of the brain. A brain response known as the N 400 is smaller when two sequentially presented pictures are semantically related (for example, doctor-nurse) than when they are unrelated (such as clock-nurse). According to the late-processing theory, the N 400 should depend on the semantic relatedness of the target picture even when it cannot be reported. In contrast, the early interference theory predicts no effect of this semantic relationship because EIB abolishes the perceptual and semantic processing of the target. Subjects were asked to view an RSVP stream and decide whether or not a “prime” picture outlined in red was related to a “test” picture {{at the end of the}} stream. The prime picture was preceded by a negative, neutral, or baseline distractor picture. N 400 s elicited by the <b>test</b> <b>picture</b> were completely suppressed during incorrect trials, regardless of distractor condition. I conclude that semantic priming, as measured with the N 400, critically depends on awareness of the prime picture. Neuroscienc...|$|E
