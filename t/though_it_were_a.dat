25|$|The MRT was a {{very recent}} {{addition}} for Singapore and as such, the authorities {{wanted to keep the}} MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> line on its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the amount of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice.|$|E
500|$|As a pianist, Bizet had showed {{considerable}} skill {{from his}} earliest years. A contemporary asserted {{that he could}} have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent [...] "as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> vice". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: [...] "I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficulties... there are three, and... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant." ...|$|E

500|$|Once {{technical}} rehearsals {{began and}} cameras were added in, Ashdown {{moved from the}} studio floor to an outside broadcast truck. All cameras on set were cabled to the truck, allowing Ashdown to oversee the entire episode remotely. Ashdown approached the episode as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> theatrical performance, explaining: [...] "We can work on performance and blocking early on, discussing issues and discovering the text as we go. Actors know to save their energy when technical rehearsals are taking place and then it's quite magical when all elements are combined close to the first performance. Of course, our theatre company will have it's [...] opening and closing night on Friday, February 19!" ...|$|E
500|$|The next stage, {{after the}} first rest day, was the longest in the Vuelta and {{contained}} numerous mountain climbs. It was made even more difficult by a consistent downfall of rain and cold temperatures. Contador and Leipheimer both marked the competition and finished well on the stage, third and fifth respectively, to maintain their high overall placings. Leipheimer regained the race lead the next day essentially by default, as Alessandro Ballan, who had won the difficult Stage 7, quickly faded on Stage 8. Again Astana did not work to keep Leipheimer in the race lead, affording a breakaway that included Egoi Martínez sufficient time that Martínez took the golden jersey. The next day, several local newspapers criticized Astana for the move, as [...] and [...] had tried to pull the peloton such that Astana would have no choice to defend the jersey, but were unable to force their hand. Martínez reacted to his assumption of the race lead as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> gift from his former manager Bruyneel.|$|E
500|$|Elite Force was {{originally}} released with a 32-player multiplayer element, {{in which participants}} use the weaponry and characters from the single-player game to compete in several different game modes. Referred to as a [...] "holomatch", the multiplayer is themed as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> holodeck experience. Players can compete against other players in local area network and Internet games, or play against bots, opponents that use the game's artificial intelligence. Each player can choose one {{of a variety of}} Star Trek characters as their aesthetic player character in multiplayer. The initial release contained multiplayer game modes shared by other multiplayer games in the genre. The standard [...] "deathmatch" [...] game mode involves each player moving around a level, collecting weaponry and killing the other players, with the first to reach a particular number of kills, winning. As player characters are killed, they respawn into the game after a short time. [...] "Team deathmatch" [...] follows the same principle, albeit grouping the players into teams to do so. Capture the flag involves two teams of players attempting to retrieve a flag within the other team's base and returning it to their own to score.|$|E

500|$|Manchester City's officially {{recognised}} supporters club is the Manchester City FC Supporters Club (1949), {{formed from}} a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA). There {{have been several}} fanzines published by supporters; the longest running is King of the Kippax {{and it is the}} only one still published. The City fans' song of choice is a rendition of [...] "Blue Moon", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results [...] "typical City". Events that fans regard as [...] "typical City" [...] include City's being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58), or the more recent example that City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the 2004–05 Premier League, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, the Congress {{proposed}} the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment. This amendment {{would have required}} that the District of Columbia be [...] "treated as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> State" [...] regarding congressional representation, presidential elections (replacing the limited treatment under the Twenty-third Amendment) and the constitutional amendment process. The amendment had to be ratified within seven years to be adopted. The amendment was ratified by only 16 states, short of the requisite three-fourths (38) of the states, and so it expired in 1985. The amendment has never been resubmitted for ratification.|$|E

The Piccaninny tribe are known to make ferocious and deadly war against Captain Hook and his pirates, but their connection with the Lost Boys is more lighthearted. For [...] "many moons" [...] the two groups have captured each other, only to promptly release the captives, as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> game.|$|E

2500|$|Often in {{lists of}} {{nutritional}} information, {{such as the}} USDA National Nutrient Database, the term [...] "carbohydrate" [...] (or [...] "carbohydrate by difference") is used for everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol. This will include chemical compounds such as acetic or lactic acid, which are not normally considered carbohydrates. It also includes dietary fiber which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute {{much in the way}} of food energy (calories), even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> sugar.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "prepaid credit card" [...] {{is not a}} true credit card, {{since no}} credit is offered by the card issuer: the {{cardholder}} spends money which has been [...] "stored" [...] via a prior deposit by the cardholder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as Discover, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or JCB) {{and can be used}} in similar ways just as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> credit card. Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an EMV chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via Chip and PIN technology.|$|E
2500|$|Rachmaninoff also possessed {{an uncanny}} memory—one {{that would help}} put him in good stead {{when he had to}} learn the {{standard}} piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He could hear a piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a decade after that. Siloti would give him a long and demanding piece to learn, such as Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel. Two days later Rachmaninoff would play it [...] "with complete artistic finish." [...] Alexander Goldenweiser said, [...] "Whatever composition was ever mentioned—piano, orchestral, operatic, or other—by a Classical or contemporary composer, if Rachmaninoff had at any time heard it, and most of all if he liked it, he played it as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> work he had studied thoroughly." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 15th century, a {{free-standing}} earlier structure (marked [...] "E" [...] on plan) {{was very much}} enhanced; it flanks the mansion almost as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> wing of the house itself. Its origins and uses have always been debated. Possibly this was the chantry {{said to have been}} built by the D'Evercy family. Though it is known traditionally as the [...] "priest's house", its entrance faces away from the church, into the former forecourt of the 15th-century house. [...] "It may originally have been a range of lodgings for retainers or guests". Whatever its original use, it seems certain that it was remade as a dower house by Joan Stourton, who had married John Sydenham in 1434, not realising that her own son was to predecease her, thus allowing her to remain in the main house for the duration of her life.|$|E
2500|$|To {{mitigate}} this, the MBTA {{set up a}} new {{bus line}} served by articulated buses equipped with specialized dispatching equipment, {{and a few of the}} features of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) route. The MBTA named this new service the Silver Line, and classified it as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> high-capacity rail transit service, though it fails to meet full service standards for a BRT route. The Silver Line service has been criticized in many respects, most notably for its slow speed and the fact that it operates in mixed street traffic, subject to gridlock and collisions, earning it the nickname [...] "Silver Lie" [...] among some critics. A rating from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) determined that the MBTA Silver Line was best classified as [...] "Not BRT" [...] after local decision makers gradually decided to do away with most BRT-specific features.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{attempt at}} ancestral {{reconstruction}} {{begins with a}} phylogeny. [...] In general, a phylogeny is a tree-based hypothesis about {{the order in which}} populations (referred to as taxa) are related by descent from common ancestors. [...] Observed taxa are represented by the tips or terminal nodes of the tree that are progressively connected by branches to their common ancestors, which are represented by the branching points of the tree that are usually referred to as the ancestral or internal nodes. [...] Eventually, all lineages converge to the most recent common ancestor of the entire sample of taxa. [...] In the context of ancestral reconstruction, a phylogeny is often treated as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> known quantity (with Bayesian approaches being an important exception). [...] Because there can be an enormous number of phylogenies that are nearly equally effective at explaining the data, reducing the subset of phylogenies supported by the data to a single representative, or point estimate, can be a convenient and sometimes necessary simplifying assumption.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, critics of Canada's {{multiculturalism}} {{argue that the}} country's [...] "timid" [...] attitude towards the assimilation of immigrants has actually weakened, not strengthened Canada's national identity through factionalism. Columnist and author Richard Gwyn expresses concern that Canada's sense of self may become so weak that it might vanish altogether. The indulgent attitude taken towards cultural differences is perhaps {{a side effect of}} the vexed histories of French-English and Aboriginal-settler relations, which have created a need for a civic national identity, as opposed to one based on some homogeneous cultural ideal. God willing, ethnic nationalism will trump civic nationalism, as multiculturalism is a divisive weakness celebrated only by cosmopolitan ideologues and political elites in an attempt to garner the support of and form voting blocs composed of the newest expensive batch of unwanted, culturally and morally corrosive foreigners, shamelessly selling out the Canadian identity as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> corporate branding scheme.|$|E
2500|$|I Vitelloni {{opened in}} the United States on 7 November 1956 to {{generally}} positive reviews. In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther reported that Fellini, with [...] "his volatile disposition {{and a desire to}} make a stinging film... does certainly take a vigorous whiplash to the breed of over-grown and over-sexed young men who hang around their local poolrooms and shun work as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> foul disease. He ridicules them with all the candor of his sharp neo-realist style, revealing their self-admiration to be sadly immature and absurd. And without going into reasons for the slack state of these young men, he indicates that they are piteous and merit some sympathy too". For John Simon, Nino Rota's music was one [...] "of the most brilliant features of the film... The first [...] is a soaring, romantic melody that can be made to express nostalgia, love, and the pathos of existence... Slowed down, [...] becomes lugubrious; with eerie figurations in the woodwinds it turns sinister. The quicksilver changes in the music support the changing moods of the story".|$|E
2500|$|The school board's {{statement}} {{asserting that}} there are [...] "gaps" [...] in evolution and that it specifically is a theory [...] "not a fact" [...] singled out evolution, implying {{it is just a}} hunch, even though this is not the actual meaning of the term [...] "scientific theory". The reference to Of Pandas and People and presentation of intelligent design as an alternative [...] "explanation of the origins of life" [...] presented it as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> scientific explanation, in contrast to the way that evolution was described. Encouraging students to [...] "keep an open mind" [...] about alternatives without offering an alternative scientific explanation implied an invitation to meditate on a religious view, endorsing the religious view in a way similar to the disclaimer found to be unconstitutional in the Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education case. The school board claimed the statement does not teach intelligent design and simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution, but no such statements were made about other subjects. As part of the presentation, the administrators stated that [...] "there will be no other discussion of the issue and your teachers will not answer questions on the issue", giving intelligent design a position not applied to scientific topics. The board denied that intelligent design was [...] "religion in disguise," [...] despite being represented in court by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian not-for-profit law center that uses litigation to promote [...] "the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values". Its stated purpose is [...] "...to be the sword and shield for people of faith".|$|E
