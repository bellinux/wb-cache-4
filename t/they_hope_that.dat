In 2015, She began to conduct research on digital simulation with virtual reality.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the GCF concerns the creation of the Fund's Private Sector Facility (PSF). Many of the developed countries represented on the GCF board advocate a PSF that appeals to capital markets, in particular the pension funds and other institutional investors that control trillions of dollars that pass through Wall Street and other financial centers. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the Fund will ultimately use a broad range of financial instruments.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage {{are still trying to}} contain the {{fighting}} to as narrow a sphere as possible in the hope that partition will be implemented and a Jewish government formed; <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> if the fighting remains limited, the Arabs will acquiesce in the fait accompli. This can be seen from {{the fact that}} the Jews have not so far attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

500|$|Raëlian {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} are the concepts and principles of the religion founded by Claude Vorilhon, a former French auto racing journalist who {{changed his name to}} Raël. [...] Followers of Raëlism are believers in an advanced race of extraterrestrials called Elohim who created life on earth. Raëlians are individualists who believe in sexual self-determination. As advocates of the universal ethic and world peace, they believe the world would be better if geniuses had an exclusive right to govern in what Rael terms Geniocracy. As believers of life in outer space, <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> human scientists will follow the path of the Elohim by achieving space travel through the cosmos and creating life on other planets. As believers in the resurrection of Jesus Christ through a scientific cloning process (which includes memory transfer) by the Elohim, they encourage scientific research to extend life through cloning, however critics outside are doubtful of its possibility.|$|E

John reluctantly chooses to avoid his sons throughout most of the season while he investigates something, eventually reuniting with them in the episode [...] "Shadow." [...] However, the demonic Meg Masters attacks them and reveals that Azazel is after John. After escaping from Meg, the brothers split up from their father to keep him from the demons. When vampires murder his old mentor and steal the Colta mystical gun capable of killing anythingJohn teams up with Sam and Dean in [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] to retrieve it. Because demons cannot be killed by conventional means, <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the Colt will be effective against Azazel. In response, Meg begins killing the Winchesters' friends in [...] "Salvation," [...] and threatens to kill more unless they deliver the Colt. John is captured after trying to give her a fake gun, and reveals himself to be possessed by Azazel when the brothers come to his rescue in the first season finale [...] "Devil's Trap." [...] However, he manages to resist the demon's control. Despite John's pleas for Sam to shoot him with the Colt, Sam cannot bring himself to do so and allows Azazel to escape.

Como {{has been forced to}} come to terms with the invaders, and when the two men arrive, they announce that a new army has invaded from the north, that Barbarossa is having problems in Padua, and they seek Como's help, pointing out that the city lies between Milan and the invaders. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> Como will intervene to help the Italian cause. Suddenly, Barbarossa himself appears, proclaiming that [...] "I am Italy's great destiny". His troops have surrounded Como and now further threaten Milan.

She responds to the Countess's questions by telling her that the Count {{is not trying to}} seduce her; he is merely offering her a monetary contract in return for her affection. Figaro enters and explains his plan to distract the Count with anonymous letters warning him of adulterers. He has already sent one to the Count (via Basilio) that indicates that the Countess has a rendezvous of her own that evening. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the Count will be too busy looking for imaginary adulterers to interfere with Figaro and Susanna's wedding. Figaro additionally advises the Countess to keep Cherubino around. She should dress him up as a girl and lure the Count into an illicit rendezvous where he can be caught red-handed. Figaro leaves.|$|E

By the animosity with which they persecute all those who grow cold in this cause of pretended reform, <b>they</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>that,</b> if, through levity, inexperience, or ambition, any young person (like Mr. Pitt, for instance) happens to be once embarked in their design, they shall by a false shame keep him fast in it forever.

60|$|The {{literary}} visitors of the Royal Academy to-night desire me {{to congratulate}} their hosts {{on a very}} interesting exhibition, in which risen excellence supremely asserts itself, and from which promise of a brilliant succession in time to come is not wanting. They naturally see with especial interest the writings and persons of great men--historians, philosophers, poets, and novelists, vividly illustrated around them here. And <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they may modestly claim to have rendered some little assistance towards the production {{of many of the}} pictures in this magnificent gallery. For without the patient labours of some among them unhistoric history might have long survived in this place, and but for the researches and wandering of others among them, the most preposterous countries, the most impossible peoples, and the absurdest superstitions, manners, and customs, might have usurped the place of truth upon these walls. Nay, there is no knowing, Sir Francis Grant, what unlike portraits you yourself might have painted if you had been left, with your sitters, to idle pens, unchecked reckless rumours, and undenounced lying malevolence.|$|E

Robert Gaiton took us into the Guildhall, where many of the most worshipful citizens were assembled, discussing the matter and what is to be done, but they have no force at their command. The Flemings are in great fear. Some have betaken themselves to the churches, where <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> their lives may be respected, but without, as it seems to me, any good warrant; for, as the rabble at Canterbury did not respect even the cathedral, it is not likely that they will hold churches here as sanctuary. Robert Gaiton advised us that if we entered the city to-morrow we should not show ourselves in our present apparel, for he says that if the rabble enter, they may fall foul of any whose dresses would show them to belong to the Court, and he has given us two sober citizen suits, in which he said {{we should be able to}} move about without fear of molestation." ...|$|E

Without a shadow of legal authority they have extorted large sums of money from those mulattoes who have remained quiet and are resident here, and seem bent upon extracting all that remains of their late fortune from the whites. One of them is frequently drunk and leads a scandalous life; another appears bent solely upon enriching himself; the third seems to be a well-meaning man, but he is wholly under the control of his drunken companion. If {{this is the sort of}} aid we are to receive from France, our future is hopeless indeed. And, indeed, no small portion of my friends begin to see that unless England takes possession of the island the future is altogether hopeless.

60|$|The {{observation}} {{every day}} at noon, and the subsequent working of the vessel's course, was, as may be supposed, a feature in our lives of paramount importance; nor were there wanting (as there never are) sagacious doubters of the captain's calculations, who, so soon as his back was turned, would, {{in the absence of}} compasses, measure the chart with bits of string, and ends of pocket- handkerchiefs, and points of snuffers, and clearly prove him to be wrong by an odd thousand miles or so. It was very edifying to see these unbelievers shake their heads and frown, and hear them hold forth strongly upon navigation: not that they knew anything about it, but that they always mistrusted the captain in calm weather, or when the wind was adverse. Indeed, the mercury itself is not so variable as this class of passengers, whom you will see, when the ship is going nobly through the water, quite pale with admiration, swearing that the captain beats all captains ever known, and even hinting at subscriptions for a piece of plate; and who, next morning, when the breeze has lulled, and all the sails hang useless in the idle air, shake their despondent heads again, and say, with screwed-up lips, <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> captain is a sailor - but they shrewdly doubt him.|$|E
