Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published {{the first volume of}} the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from <b>the</b> <b>USDA</b> to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).|$|E
5|$|In 1905 <b>the</b> <b>USDA</b> {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E
