The essential features of the complex structure are consistent with the spectral data and the conformation in the crystal state. Inconsistencies between the spectral observations and crystal structure analysis of non-complexing valinomycin may be resolved if a rapid conformation equilibrium in solution is postulated; evidence for this process is discussed.

40|$|This work {{provides}} a site-scale transport model for calculating radionuclide transport in the saturated zone (SZ) at Yucca Mountain, {{for use in}} the abstractions model in support of ''Total System Performance Assessment for License Application'' (TSPA-LA). The purpose of this model report is to provide documentation for the components of the site-scale SZ transport model in accordance with administrative procedure AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models. The initial documentation of this model report was conducted under the ''Technical Work Plan For: Saturated Zone Flow and Transport Modeling and Testing'' (BSC 2003 [DIRS 163965]). The model report has been revised in accordance with the ''Technical Work Plan For: Natural System [...] Saturated Zone Analysis and Model Report Integration'', Section 2. 1. 1. 4 (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171421]) to incorporate Regulatory Integration Team comments. All activities listed in the technical work plan that are appropriate to the transport model are documented in this report and are described in Section 2. 1. 1. 4 (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171421]). This report documents: (1) the advection-dispersion transport model including matrix diffusion (Sections 6. 3 and 6. 4); (2) a description and validation of the transport model (Sections 6. 3 and 7); (3) the numerical methods for simulating radionuclide transport (Section 6. 4); (4) the parameters (sorption coefficient, Kd) and their uncertainty distributions used for modeling radionuclide sorption (Appendices A and C); (5) the parameters used for modeling colloid-facilitated radionuclide <b>transport</b> (<b>Table</b> 4 - 1, Section 6. 4. 2. 6, and Appendix B); and (6) alternative conceptual models and their dispositions (Section 6. 6). The intended use of this model is to simulate transport in saturated fractured porous rock (double porosity) and alluvium. The particle-tracking method of simulating radionuclide transport is incorporated in the finite-volume heat and mass transfer numerical analysis (FEHM) computer code, (FEHM V 2. 20, STN: 10086 - 2. 20 - 00) (LANL 2003 [DIRS 161725]) and is described in Section 6. 4 of this report. FEHM is a three-dimensional (3 -D), finite-volume, finite-element, heat and mass flow-and-transport code. This report documents the features and capabilities of the site-scale transport model for calculating radionuclide transport in the SZ at Yucca Mountain in support of the TSPA-LA. Correlative flow-model calculations using FEHM are carried out and documented in the model report ''Saturated Zone Site-Scale Flow Model'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170037]). The velocity fields are calculated by the flow model independent of the transport processes and supplied {{as a part of the}} output package from the flow model, which is then used as inputs to the transport model. Several SZ analysis model reports provide information and data needed as feed-ins for this report, and this report in turn provides technical product outputs that feed into other SZ reports.

40|$|Although Japan has a {{basically}} free economic system, it {{is necessary}} to have a long range economic project in order to carry out a sound economic policy with foresightedness. As a project of this sort, the New Long-Range Economic Program was framed by the Economic Council at the end of 1957, in response to a request of the government. In 1960 this program was reformed and developed as the National Income Doubling Program which makes clear the aim to double the national income in ten years. A feature of this program is that it has the planning of public investment as its core, though the considerations of private investment and of various institutional measures are not lacking. Tables 1 and 2 show, respectively, how this program estimates the future development of national economy and transport in this country. As regards <b>transport,</b> <b>table</b> 2 indicates a considerable (relative) decrease of the share of railways as compared with a remarkable increase of the share of cars and trucks. The extent of investment necessary for realizing those developments is also calculated. The sum which falls under the heading of public investment is shown in Table 3. What is noticeable here is that the road investment is to be greatly expanded during the coming 10 years so as to make road facilities fit for rapidly increasing automobiles. Table 4 shows the expected road improvement during 10 years in case the road investment of Table 3 is realized, and Table 5 shows the anticipated increase of automobiles. Comparing Tables 4 and 5, we cannot be so optimistic as to the condition of road congestion after 10 years, because, if the anticipation of Table 5 comes true, the increase of vehicles will necessarily outpace the road improvement in spite of the acceleration of road improvement through the expanded road investment. In the proposed program a number of organizational or institutional measures in the transport field of investment along with the over-all expansion of facilities, will improve transport systems so that they will meet expanded economic activities anticipated after 10 years. However, the author believes that the proposals are not adequate enough and must be intensified, modified or supplemented by other considerations in order to satisfy the expanded future requirements from industrial field. The author intends to clarify the inescapable defects of the proposals and other considerations made in the program, arranging them in three major points, namely; the program is 1) does not recognize fully the necessity of further rationalization in each transport field; 2) does not consider the problem of integration and co-ordination in transport in their full scale; 3) does not always gear with industrial location program and city redevelopment program, without whose co-ordination any extensive transport program result in a failure or a paper-plan.

40|$|Le Rio Desaguadero relie le lac Titicaca (alt. 3 810 m) au lac Poopo (alt. 3 670 m) dans le bassin endoréique de l'Altiplano, en Bolivie, (fig. 1). Le bassin versant est constitué de terrains sédimentaires et volcaniques, avec une végétation steppique et aucune source de {{pollution}} organique. Le climat très variable présente d'une alternance de saisons humide et sèche. Le Rio Mauri fournit 90 % du flux de MES estimé à 6, 6. 106 t an- 1 (d'après GUYOT et al., 1990). Des analyses de COT et d'autres paramètres chimiques ont été réalisées sur 15 stations en 3 campagnes (fig. 2 et tableau 1). Une ACP (fig. 3) révèle une corrélation entre COT et MES, correspondant à deux épisodes de crues (déc. 87 et fév. 88) (tableau 2). Des hypothèses concernant l'origine du carbone organique et les flux sont avancées (tableau 3). Un flux de base, principalement du COD provenant du lac Titicaca, représenterait 18 000 t an- 1. Mais le COP, quoique fortement corrélé aux MES, n'a pas la même origine que celles-ci (fig. 4); il proviendrait principalement des zones connexes au Rio Desaguadero riches en végétation aquatique. La contribution de ces flux aux bilans du carbone organique paraît négligeable pour le lac Titicaca et peu importante pour le lac Poopo. Mais le maintien des interconnexions entre le Rio Desaguadero et ses zones humides doit être intégré dans les projets d'aménagement. The Rio Desaguadero is {{the outlet}} of Lake Titicaca and flows into Lake Poopo in the endorheic watershed of the Altiplano in Bolivia (alt. 3 650 m); its main tributary is the Rio Mauri (fig. 1). The transport of dissolved and suspended solids has been recently evaluated by GUYOT et al. (1990). The data on Total Organic Carbon {{obtained for the}} first time in this hydrosystem allow to complement this investigation with an estimation of the organic carbon transport. The Altiplano is a basin filed with tertiary and quaternary sediments. The Eastern cordillera is constituted of primary rocks; the Rio Mauri flow from a tertiary volcanic watershed. The climate is rather cold, semi-arid (700 to 400 mm yr- 1) and the vegetation is steppe-like with extensive pastures (sheep, lamas). The rainy season lasts from December to March. No direct pollution source can affect the TOC. The hydrology is very variable (see GUYOT et al., 1990). The base flow issues from Lake Titicaca and depends on the water level in the lake. The Total Suspended Solids (TSS) content is very high during floods. The annual flux of TSS is 6. 6 106 t yr- 1 at Ulloma, 90 % of transported sediment coming from the Rio Mauri. TOC was measured during 3 sampling series at 15 different stations (table 1). The 25 ml samples were acidified (pH 1) with H 3 PO 4 and sent to Lyon (France) to be analysed with a Dohrmann DC 80. In February 1988, Dissolved Organic Carbon was measured on filtered samples (Whatman GF/C decarbonated at 550 °C). The major elements were analysed in La Paz (Bolivia). Raw TOC data are presented (fig. 2), with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for 9 parameters on all the samples (fig. 3). The first axis (52 % of total variance) is a scale of mineralization; it reveals a progressive concentration of dissolved elements in the Lake Poopo outlet (fig. 3 B first cluster). The mineralization of these samples seems to be inversely correlated to the discharge flowing from Lake Titicaca for the corresponding series. The second axis (23 % of total variance) shows a correlation between the TOC and the TSS (fig. 3 B, 4 th cluster). This correlation is obvious for the samples of Dec. 87 and Feb. 88 (table 2), when TSS concentrations are high due to flash floods of some effluents. Equation (1) gives the hast regression of TOC vs TSS. The organic Carbon transported is constituted of dissolved (DOC) or Particulate Organic Carbon (POC). Estimation presented for DOC and POC transport at the three gauging stations (table 3) are based on the following hypotheses :In the Rio Desaguadero, DOC concentrations seam relatively stable (fig. 2 D). Upstream of the Rio Mauri, the TOC transported at an average concentration of 11 mg. l- 1 is assumed to be mainly DOC flowing out from Lake Titicaca. DOC transport may constitute a relatively constant base flow of organic carbon. Estimation of POC transport is much more difficult. During floods from tributaries, the rise in TOC concentrations correlated with an increase of TSS seems to be essentially due to the POC. Following a classical method (MEYBECK, 1982), a non-linear regression of percentages of POC In TSS vs TSS was calculed (equation 2), using the samples with high TSS concentrations (fig. 4 A). Then, the POC fluxes were estimated using daily data of TSS for the gauging stations CA and UL. As most of the TSS come from the Rio Mauri results from this estimation that the flow rate of TOC from this stream would reach 7 t km- 2 yr- 1. But this value according to MEYBECK (1982) is close to the export of a tropical rainforest. Thus, this hypothesis of a POC transport directly linked to the TSS flux must be rejected. POC and TSS, although correlated, have distinct origins. This is shown by the tact that the percentages of POC in TSS in the samples used to calculate equation (2) are much higher than those given by MEYBECK (1982) for world rivers (fig. 4 B). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the POC could come from Rio Desaguadero Borders and wetlands, often rich in aquatic vegetation, and very extensive in some places (especially upstream of Nazacara and downstream of Eucaliptus). This particulate carbon might be flushed into the mainstream during rainy periods, while at the same time TSS flow down from tributaries. Hypotheses on POC <b>transport</b> (<b>table</b> 3) in the Rio Desaguadero are thus based on a POC/TSS correlation (equation (2)) valid only for the mainstream, the contribution of Rio Mauri to the total flux being estimated on the basis of e TOC export rate of 0. 5 t km- 2 yr- 1. Contribution of these fluxes to organic carbon budgets seems to be negligible for Lake Titicaca, whose phytoplanctonic primary production is estimated at 4 106 t C yr- 1 (RICHERSON et al., 1977). When considering only the labile fraction of TOC (ITTEKOT, 1988), the readily matabolizable organic carbon input in Lake Poopo hydrosystem could be evaluated to 36 000 t yr- 1, corresponding to about 13 g C m- 2 yr- 1; that might be unimportant for this presumably highly productive lake system. In conclusion, these preliminary data lead to hypotheses which consider the Rio Desaguadero as a very particular hydrosystem in organic carbon transport. If most of the particulate carbon comes from margins, the necessity for maintaining interconnexions between the main Carmel and the wetlands fn future regulation projects must be emphasized...|$|E

They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a <b>transport</b> sack, a <b>table</b> cloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they {{can be used as a}} cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head.|$|R
30|$|As {{alluded to}} above, {{in many respects}} and despite its revolutionary flavour, the AV does not change much {{when it comes to}} {{deciding}} on the main principles for <b>transport</b> policy. Revising <b>Table</b> 1, the choice between pathways A, B or C remains the same and is still challenging both options, namely with and without the introduction of AVs. These choices must be made now, otherwise we are sure to continue on the business-as-usual pathway of high-carbon mobility. Surely it will be inevitable to have a transition period of AVs, semi-autonomous and manual cars coexisting on roads as with the uptake of any other new technology. Thus planning should be cautious taking into account the benefits and threats (see Benefits and threats of future mobility patterns section) until the use of AVs gains broader momentum and we make up our minds about their public or private element [44] and until effective legal frameworks evolve.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the design}} considerations and fabrication techniques for building a glovebox for the Plasma Hearth Process (PHP) radioactive bench-scale system. The PHP radioactive bench-scale system uses a plasma torch to process a variety of radioactive materials into a final vitrified waste form. The processed waste will contain plutonium and trace amounts of other radioactive materials. The glovebox used in this system is located directly below the plasma chamber and is called the Hearth Handling Enclosure (HHE). The HHE is designed to maintain a confinement boundary between the processed waste and the operator. Operations that take place inside the HHE include raising and lowering the hearth using a hydraulic lift <b>table,</b> <b>transporting</b> the hearth within the HHE using an overhead monorail and hoist system, sampling and disassembly of the processed waste and hearth, weighing the hearth, rebuilding a hearth, and sampling HEPA filters. The PHP radioactive bench-scale system {{is located at the}} TREAT facility at Argonne National Laboratory-West in Idaho Falls, Idaho...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel design of Java table browser using XML(jTBX). A standard table-browsing environment {{is provided in}} the form of Java applet which can be opened in any web browser such as Netscape, or Internet Explore with Java 1. 2 plug-in installed. Some manipulation functions to tables are supported for various level of objects in table(table, sub-table, column, row, cell). A hierarchical Java tree provides the table of content (TOC) of available tables. Three tier architecture is used in the jTBX system design. Remote database tier provides raw data from distributed sites. Web server tier generates the response in the standard XML format to the requests from the client side tier (table browser). Metadata for tables are integrated into the XML files (or streams) before being used by client Java applet. Multiple threads are generated for a large <b>table</b> <b>transporting.</b> Headings: Technical Tools and Concept – Java table browser using XML System Structure – Three tier web structure Data transporting method—Multiple Java thread...|$|R
