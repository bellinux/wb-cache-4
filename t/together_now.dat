25|$|When first {{carried out}} in 1987, the {{original}} US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal solid waste, medical waste, sewage sludge, and hazardous waste <b>together</b> <b>now</b> produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, {{and is now the}} largest source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output.|$|E

25|$|Russell Jones {{was born}} on November 15, 1968 in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, New York. He and his cousins Robert Diggs and Gary Grice shared a taste for rap music and martial arts-style movies. Jones, Diggs, and Grice (later known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, RZA, and GZA respectively) formed the group Force of the Imperial Master, which {{subsequently}} became known as All in <b>Together</b> <b>Now</b> after their successful underground single of the same name. They eventually added six more members to their group, calling it the Wu-Tang Clan. The group released their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) in 1993, receiving notable commercial and critical success.|$|E
25|$|The eldest male at {{the table}} was always served first, {{commonly}} served {{to them in the}} men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine <b>together</b> <b>now</b> and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E
25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle <b>together.</b> <b>Now,</b> that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E

500|$|The early 21st century poetic {{tradition}} {{appears to}} continue to strongly orient itself to earlier precursor poetic traditions such as those initiated by Whitman, Emerson, and Wordsworth. The literary critic Geoffrey Hartman has used the phrase [...] "the anxiety of demand" [...] to describe contemporary response to older poetic traditions as [...] "being fearful that the fact no longer has a form", building on a trope introduced by Emerson. Emerson had maintained that in the debate concerning poetic structure where either [...] "form" [...] or [...] "fact" [...] could predominate, that one need simply [...] "Ask the fact for the form." [...] This has been challenged at various levels by other literary scholars such as Bloom who has stated in summary form concerning the early 21st century that: [...] "The generation of poets who stand <b>together</b> <b>now,</b> mature and ready to write the major American verse of the twenty-first century, may yet be seen as what Stevens called 'a great shadow's last embellishment,' the shadow being Emerson's." ...|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} in a special-edition issue of Mojo magazine, Peter Doggett writes that [...] "The papers got all trippy for Yellow Submarine". Beat Instrumental bemoaned {{the paucity of}} new {{material}} by the band, but added: [...] "be not of bad cheer. The George Martin score to the film is really very nice, and two tracks by George Harrison redeem the first side. Both [...] are superb pieces, considerably more enthralling than the most draggy All <b>Together</b> <b>Now,</b> a rather wet track." [...] In a review for International Times, Barry Miles considered Martin's score [...] "superbly produced" [...] and, of the songs, wrote only of [...] "It's All Too Much", which he described as, variously, [...] "Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling" [...] and [...] "Happy singalong music". Writing in their book [...] (1975), NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler bemoaned the commercial considerations {{that resulted in a}} full soundtrack album, saying that the four new songs [...] "would have made a superb EP".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, {{also known as}} the All in <b>Together</b> <b>Now</b> Crew. Each member {{recorded}} under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released Words from the Genius (1991) on Cold Chillin' Records and Prince Rakeem released Ooh I Love You Rakeem (1991) on Tommy Boy Records. Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they took on new monikers (The Genius became GZA while Prince Rakeem became RZA) and refocused their efforts. RZA discussed the matter in their release The Wu-Tang Manual (2005), stating [...] " [...] made the decision to sign House of Pain over us. When they dropped me, I was thinking, 'Damn, they chose a bunch of whiteboy shit over me.'" ...|$|E
