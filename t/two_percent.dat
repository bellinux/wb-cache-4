Twenty <b>two</b> <b>percents</b> natural pozzolana and five percents limestone were interground with clinker and gypsum {{in a laboratory}} ball mill to compare the power consumption with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) (95 % clinker and 5 % gypsum). The ternary blended cement took less time to reach to the same fineness level as OPC due to soft pozzolana and high grade lime stone indicating that intergrinding may reduce overall power consumption. Blended cement production using natural pozzolana and limestone may reduce the energy consumption and green house gas emissions...|$|R
