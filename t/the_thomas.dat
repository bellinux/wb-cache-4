40|$|In Part I (G. Olshanski, math. RT/ 9804086) and Part II (A. Borodin, math. RT/ 9804087) we {{developed}} {{an approach to}} certain probability distributions on <b>the</b> <b>Thoma</b> simplex. <b>The</b> latter has infinite dimension and {{is a kind of}} dual object for the infinite symmetric group. Our approach is based on studying the correlation functions of certain related point stochastic processes. In the present paper we consider the so-called tail point processes which describe the limit behavior of <b>the</b> <b>Thoma</b> parameters (coordinates on <b>the</b> <b>Thoma</b> simplex) with large numbers. The tail processes turn out to be stationary processes on the real line. Their correlation functions have determinantal form with a kernel which generalizes the well-known sine kernel arising in random matrix theory. Our second result is a law of large numbers for <b>the</b> <b>Thoma</b> parameters. We also produce Sturm-Liouville operators commuting with the Whittaker kernel introduced in Part II and with the generalized sine kernel. Comment: AMSTeX, 20 page...|$|R

40|$|Historically, Thomas has a rich identity. Much of the apocrypha {{was named}} for the “doubting” disciple, such as The Infancy Gospel of <b>Thomas,</b> <b>The</b> Book of <b>Thomas</b> <b>the</b> Contender, The Acts of <b>the</b> Apostle <b>Thomas,</b> and <b>The</b> Gospel of <b>Thomas,</b> yet these traditions do not address Thomas’s doubting story from The Gospel of John. In fact, <b>Thomas</b> becomes <b>the</b> favored disciple in <b>The</b> Book of <b>Thomas</b> <b>the</b> Contender and logion 13 of <b>The</b> Gospel of <b>Thomas.</b> In <b>The</b> Acts of <b>the</b> Apostle <b>Thomas</b> <b>the</b> disciple leaves Rome to evangelize in India where he is {{eventually}} martyred. Today, he is still revered in South India as the messenger that brought Christianity {{to the country and}} pilgrims travel to his tomb in Mylapore. These traditions portray Thomas as anything but doubtful. With the discovery of <b>The</b> Gospel of <b>Thomas</b> and <b>The</b> Book of <b>Thomas</b> <b>the</b> Contenderin the Nag Hammadi library, scholarship on Thomasine traditions in early Christianity has increased, but scholarship of the Mediterranean and India have remained relatively isolated. This paper seeks to discuss the earlier history of Thomas as a religious icon, from its initial appearances in the first century through its earlier developments in India, and evince not only the historical progression linking those traditions, but also the thematic development across time and regions...|$|R
