40|$|Over {{the past}} six years, the growth of Internet {{retailing}} has resulted in dramatic challenges for existing retailers. <b>Traditional</b> <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> distribution have been challenged by the Internet's ability to offer products to distant consumers, resulting in increased competition in both product range and price. The pressure to enter this competitive market has resulted in high expenditure by potential and existing e-tailers attempting to achieve online sales. However to date, use of the Internet for retail purchases lags far behind more <b>traditional</b> <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> distribution. Despite high levels of Internet use in Asia, uptake of online shopping has been much higher in the United States, and Internet retailing in both the U. S. and the Asia Pacific is marked more by high profile failures than by successes. This study analyses reasons for the limited success of online shopping, particularly in Australia and Hong Kong, examines whether there were warning signs that Internet shopping would not take off, and considers the implications for existing or potential e-tailers in the Asia-Pacific. 12 page(s...|$|R

In representative democracies in particular, this apathy is exemplified by falling voter turnouts, party memberships and participation in community association. To counter apathy, e-governance techniques including e-voting which is a crucial process in democracies, have been deployed by varied governments in mature democracies, leveraging the pervasive power of the Internet, particularly during elections. In this paper, the significant success story of French Presidential Elections in early 2007 is narrated and examined through the historiographical lens. Specifically, the process of this election, seemingly orchestrated via the Internet, is appraised as a valid benchmarking anti-apathy approach of e-governance, to enable better citizen participation, in this representative democracy...|$|R
