It {{received}} enthusiastic reception from <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival {{was surprised to see}} the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land Is Mine for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confusing <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> a result.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{combined}} poetic genius with {{a practical}} {{sense of the}} theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method of evoking ethnocentric appeals {{come in the}} form of Barbarism vs. Gallantry (Reid 269). It depicts the enemy's {{cultural}} values with evil characteristics, and <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> <b>as</b> angelic.|$|R

5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Towards the mid-to-late 1960s, {{directors}} such as Armando Bo produced sex comedies which shocked <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> {{they were}} soft porn and displayed nudity and sex {{not seen in}} the industry before. This preference continued into the 1970s, with Jorge Porcel's suggestive comedies.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Sander {{returned}} to the Estonian National Opera, where he engaged as a producer and director. In 2011, his production of Die Czardasfürstin became a solid hit with <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>as</b> is his recent production of Ball im Savoy, which opened in January 2014.|$|E

In the American version, only Kong's roar is present on the soundtrack.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of his Gran Concerto Futuristico (1917) was met with strong disapproval and violence from <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>as</b> Russolo himself had predicted. None of his intoning devices have survived, though recently some have been reconstructed and used in performances. Although Russolo's works bear little resemblance to contemporary noise music such as Japanoise, his efforts helped to introduce noise as a musical aesthetic and broaden the perception of sound as an artistic medium.|$|E
25|$|Oblomov {{opened at}} the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1964. It {{was based on the}} Russian classic by Ivan Goncharov, and gave Milligan the {{opportunity}} to play most of the title role in bed. Unsure of his material, on the opening night he improvised a great deal, treating <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> part of the plot almost, and he continued in this manner {{for the rest of the}} run, and on tour as 'Son of Oblomov'. The show ran at the Comedy Theatre in London's West End in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Alice Lim as Siew Luan: Alice Lim {{was one of}} the actresses {{that were}} cast later. She is the first female MC for major events in Singapore, and used to be active in the 1970s. The {{directors}} admired her 'beautiful' delivery of Hokkien in the film. In the film, Siew Luan married Poh Huat when she was young and remained a housewife ever since. She is seen to brew bottles of herbal tea perpetually (for members of the family, who, except for Irene, tend to reject them). She shares part of her life story with <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> the film concludes.|$|E
25|$|Mazzoni resurrects {{the ancient}} {{tradition}} of linking poetry to rhetoric, {{which also has}} the credible, rather than the true, as its object. Interestingly, he also gives great importance to poetry’s effect on <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> a determinant of quality – though he admits {{that much of the}} exercise of poetry involves attempting faithful imitation (albeit of human constructs or “categories”, not ones that are necessarily “true”), success in poetry is ultimately determined by persuasion, not truth and objectivity. For him, successful poetry is something that occurs in and of the audience, not outside and independent of it. For Mazzoni, even “poetry” is a meaningless category – it is our classifications that constitute criticism, not our ability to form a relationship with some reified thing called “The Poem”.|$|E
25|$|According to René Tinner and Stephan Plank {{in a radio}} {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Conny Plank, it was Brian Eno's idea that Plank should produce the U2-album The Joshua Tree instead of him. After being introduced to the band by Eno and after a short meeting, Plank turned down the job ("I cannot work with this singer"). According to the companion website of the documentary film Conny Plank – The Potential of Noise (but not the film itself), after the meeting, Plank firstly asked for time for a second thought. In the meantime he attended a U2 concert at Freilichtbühne Loreley, where U2's Bono introduced Plank to <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> their new producer. Thereupon Plank has left the concert and never again talked to any member of U2.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Greece {{during the}} time of New Comedy, from which Plautus drew so much of his inspiration, there were {{permanent}} theaters that catered to <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> well as the actor. The greatest playwrights of the day had quality facilities in which to present their work and, in a general sense, there was always enough public support to keep the theater running and successful. However, {{this was not the case}} in Rome {{during the time}} of the Republic, when Plautus wrote his plays. While there was public support for theater and people came to enjoy tragedy and comedy alike, there was also a notable lack of governmental support. No permanent theater existed in Rome until Pompey dedicated one in 55 BCE in the Campus Martius. The lack of a permanent space was a key factor in Roman theater and Plautine stagecraft.|$|E
