It is shown that the differences in enthalpy of formation between the fcc type 3 R or 6 R and the 9 R, 18 R or 2 H structures are above all due to a lattice distortion which reduces the energy per stacking fault, considering 9 R, I 8 R and 2 H as a basic face centered lattice into which faults are introduced on each third or second plane. In the second part the factors are discussed which are important in the relative stabilities not only between the matrix and martensite phases, but also for the equilibrium phases in the noble metal alloys. These are: i) <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> <b>difference</b> AS, which is a function mainly of electron concentration ela.

A study of the 2 C TCR/SIYR/H- 2 K(b) system using a computational alanine scanning and a much faster binding free energy decomposition based on the Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method is presented. The {{results show that the}} TCR-p-MHC binding free energy decomposition using this approach and including entropic terms provides a detailed and reliable description of the interactions between the molecules at an atomistic level. Comparison of the decomposition results with experimentally determined activity differences for alanine mutants yields a correlation of 0. 67 when the entropy is neglected and 0. 72 when the entropy is taken into account. Similarly, comparison of experimental activities with variations in binding free energies determined by computational alanine scanning yields correlations of 0. 72 and 0. 74 when the entropy is neglected or taken into account, respectively. Some key interactions for the TCR-p-MHC binding are analyzed and some possible side chains replacements are proposed in the context of TCR protein engineering. In addition, a comparison of the two theoretical approaches for estimating the role of each side chain in the complexation is given, and a new ad hoc approach to decompose <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> term into atomic contributions, the linear decomposition of <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> (LDVE), is introduced. The latter allows the rapid calculation of the entropic contribution of interesting side chains to the binding. This new method is {{based on the idea that}} the most important contributions to <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of a molecule originate from residues that contribute most to <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> amplitude of <b>the</b> normal modes. The LDVE approach is shown to provide results very similar to those of the exact but highly computationally demanding method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe heat {{capacities}} of two samples of a fcc Cu–Zn alloy with the composition CuZn 15 and CuZn 34 were measured from T= 5 K to 573 K using relaxation and differential scanning calorimetry. Below ∼ 90 K, they are characterised by negative excess heat capacities deviating from ideal mixing {{by up to}} − 0. 20 and − 0. 44 J·mol− 1 ·K− 1 for CuZn 15 and CuZn 34, respectively. The excess heat capacities produce excess <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies,</b> which are less negative compared to the excess entropy available from the literature. Since the literature entropy data contain both, the configurational and <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>entropy,</b> the <b>difference</b> is attributed to the excess configurational entropy. The thermodynamics of different short-range ordered samples was also investigated. The extent of the short-range order had no influence on the heat capacity below T= 300 K. Above T= 300 K, where the ordering changed during the measurement, the heat capacity depended strongly on the thermal history of the samples. From these data, the heat and entropy of ordering was calculated. The results on <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> {{of this study were}} also used to test a relationship for estimating <b>the</b> excess <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing...|$|R

A broad spectrum of transition types is shown to take place. These transition types are: (i) one-to-one type, in which the global minimum, which is dominant at low temperatures, transforms into another single isomer with increasing temperature; (ii) one-to-many type, in which the transition is from a single isomer to a family of other isomers; (iii) many-to-many type, in which the transition is between two different families of isomers; (iv) many-to-one type, in which <b>the</b> effect of <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is to greatly {{reduce the number of}} relevant structures with increasing temperatures. We provide a rationale for these behaviors, which stem from the interplay between energetics and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> effects. <b>The</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is explained by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> density of states and the specific features of the normal modes.

Cu always segregates to the boundary. The concentration of the first layer adjacent to the boundary increases monotonically with misorientation and no obvious cusps are observed. All other thermodynamic properties vary smoothly with the misorientation, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of <b>the</b> boundaries without segregation. <b>The</b> unsegregated <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> shows a large peak at the misorientation corresponding to the [Sigma] 17 boundary and two minima around the [Sigma] 13 and [Sigma] 5 boundary orientations.

In this thesis I outline vibrational thermodynamic models and the experimental tools that provide evidence on phonon behavior. The introductory section discusses the history of metallurgy and thermodynamic theory, {{with an emphasis on}} the role of iron and cementite, two important components of steels. The thermodynamic framework for understanding vibrational material behavior is provided alongside the growing body of experimental and computational tools that provide physical insight on <b>vibrational</b> properties. <b>The</b> high temperature <b>vibrational</b> behavior of iron and cementite are explored within this context in the final chapters. Body-centered-cubic iron exhibits decreasing phonon energies at elevated temperatures. The observed energy change in not uniform across phonon modes in iron, and specific phonon modes show significant decreases in energy that are not explained by simple vibrational models. This anomalously energy decrease is linked to the second-nearest-neighbor interactions in the bcc structure, through examination of fitted interatomic force constants. The large changes in phonon energy result in a significant increase in <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy,</b> called <b>the</b> nonharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy,</b> which emulates <b>the</b> temperature behavior of the magnetic entropy across the Curie temperature. <b>The</b> nonharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is attributed to interactions between the vibrations and state of magnetic disorder in the material, which persists above the magnetic transitions and extends the stability region of the bcc phase. Orthorombic cementite, Fe 3 C, exhibits anisotropic magneto-volume behavior in the ferromagnetic phase including regions very low thermal expansion. The phonon modes of cementite show anomalous temperature dependence, with low energy phonon modes increasing their energy at elevated temperatures in the ferromagnetic phase. This behavior is reversed after the magnetic transition and these same phonon modes lower their energies with temperature, consistent with observed thermal expansion. This atypical phonon behavior lowers <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of cementite up to the Curie temperature. The experimentally observed increase in low energy acoustic phonons affects the elastic behavior of Fe 3 C, increasing the isotropy of elastic response. First principles calculations link the observed phonon energy increases to specific vibrational modes that are polarized along the b-axis, which aligns with the closest Fe-Fe bonding direction. The nonharmonic behavior of <b>the</b> <b>vibrational</b> modes are discussed in the context of other observations of anomalous anisotropic magneto-volume behavior in Fe 3 C. </p...|$|R
