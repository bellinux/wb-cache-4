5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference,</b> was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|In mid-2010 Holden {{released}} the VE Series 2 (VEII). <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> saw {{the introduction of}} the Holden iQ system, a centre-mounted LCD display that provides navigation, bluetooth, and controls to the stereo. There were also small alterations to the styling {{and a number of other}} changes.|$|E
5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's Parent Company, {{announced}} {{that they would be}} re-branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon. For this change, a new livery has been adopted. The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific's new livery in the tail logo and font. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> is instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme, it has a light maroon theme. The titles say Cathay Dragon along with Chinese lettering reading the name. Dragonair's Dragon logo has been retained and appears next to the cockpit windows. Airbus A330-300, B-HYQ, was the first aircraft to wear the new livery.|$|E
5|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{investigation}} at the site, Apple River Fort {{was found to}} display a nearly identical construction pattern to that of Fort Blue Mounds, another Black Hawk War frontier fort near present-day Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between the two structures was in the placement of buildings within the stockade walls. The digs at Apple River uncovered a dozen original features of Apple River Fort. The remains of four cellars were found within the fort, one in southeast corner of the fort {{may have been used}} for food storage or as a dairy-processing pit. In the northwest corner of the fort, there were two more cellars, just west of one of the fort's log buildings. The largest cellar was located beneath the fort's blockhouse, in its southeast corner, and was used as a trash pit into the 1840s. The blockhouse cellar yielded the earliest archaeological material collected at the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} F-4J and the British Phantoms was {{the absence of}} the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan, the former being fitted with the GE J79-10B. This {{produced}} less power than the British engine, but had a faster afterburner light up, giving it better performance at high altitude, at the expense of slightly poorer acceleration at low level. The high-altitude performance was helped by the reduced drag from its smaller air intakes. Initially delivered capable of carrying the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles (AAM), they were soon made compatible with the Skyflash and SUU-23A gun pod, bringing them into line {{with the rest of the}} RAF's Phantoms. Despite modifications to allow them to operate with the rest of the fleet, the F-4Js retained the vast bulk of the equipment they were originally fitted with, even requiring their crews to use American flying helmets.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E

25|$|According to Louis de La Vallée-Poussin and Alex Wayman, {{the view}} of the Vajrayana is based on Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, mainly the Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> seen by Vajrayana thinkers is Tantra's superiority due to being a faster vehicle to liberation {{containing}} many skillful methods (upaya) of tantric ritual.|$|E
25|$|There are two nominal classes, Common Nominals (common nouns, demonstratives, locative/temporal/etc. adverbs) and Proper Nomals (Proper names , pronouns). <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} two classes are 1) {{semantic}} — Proper nominals have pronominal characteristics, and, 2) declensional, for example Proper Nominals have one locative case rather than the three of Common Nominals.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> between Machiavelli and the Socratics, {{according}} to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism and therefore his rejection {{of both a}} teleological view of nature, and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their teleological understanding of things, Socratics argued that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli emphasized that such things happen by blind chance, or human action.|$|E
25|$|Bonds {{and stocks}} are both securities, but <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the two}} is that (capital) {{stockholders}} have an equity stake in a company (i.e., they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e., they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors in the event of bankruptcy.|$|E
