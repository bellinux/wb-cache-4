5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory.

A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E

The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E

25|$|For trophic cascades to be ubiquitous, {{communities}} must generally act as food chains, with discrete <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> Most communities, however, have complex food webs. In {{real food}} webs, consumers often feed at multiple <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> (omnivory), organisms often change their diet {{as they grow}} larger, cannibalism occurs, and consumers are subsidized by inputs of resources from outside the local community, all of which blur the distinctions between <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high <b>trophic</b> <b>level.</b> Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular pollutant, using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation records a {{time when}} the local {{environment}} was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Ornitholestes, Saurophaganax, and Torvosaurus; the sauropods Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus; and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Apatosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinhã Formationmainly Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, and Torvosaurusor have a close counterpartBrachiosaurus and Lusotitan, Camptosaurus and Draconyx, and Apatosaurus and Dinheirosaurus. Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaur. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low <b>trophic</b> <b>level.</b> Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E
40|$|Carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotopic composition {{was used to}} identify the main sources of carbon and describe the main trophic pathways in Deluge Inlet, a near-pristine mangrove estuary in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Producers' δ 13 C varied from − 28. 9 ‰ for mangroves to − 18. 6 ‰ for seagrass. Animals were also well separated in δ 13 C (− 25. 4 ‰ to − 16. 3 ‰ for invertebrates and − 25. 2 ‰ to − 17. 2 ‰ for fish), suggesting considerable differences in ultimate sources of carbon, from a substantial reliance on mangrove carbon to an almost exclusive reliance on seagrass. In general, invertebrates had lower δ 15 N than fish, indicating lower <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> Among fish, δ 15 N values reflected well the assumed <b>trophic</b> <b>levels,</b> as species from lower <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> had lower δ 15 N than species from higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> <b>Trophic</b> <b>levels</b> and <b>trophic</b> length were estimated based on δ 15 N of invertebrate primary consumers (6. 1 ‰), with results suggesting a food web with four <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> There was also evidence of {{a high level of}} diet overlap between fish species, as indicated by similarities in δ 13 C for fish species of higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> Stable isotope data was also useful to construct a general model for this food web, where five main trophic pathways were identified: one based on both mangrove and microphytobenthos, one on plankton, two on both microphytobenthos and seagrass, and one based mainly on seagrass. This model again suggested the presence of four <b>trophic</b> <b>levels,</b> in agreement with the value calculated based on the difference in δ 15 N between invertebrate primary consumers and top piscivores...|$|R

40|$|The {{food web}} in Terminos Lagoon, {{south-western}} Gulf of Mexico {{was dominated by}} the detrital pathway, with benthic invertebrates playing {{a significant role in}} transferring energy from detritus to higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> The fish yield per unit of net primary production was only 0. 04 %. Fractional <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 1. 0 to 3. 31, with fish occupying the highest <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> Using network analysis, the system network was mapped into a linear food chain and five discrete <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> were found with a mean trophic transfer efficiency of 7 %.

5|$|This {{catch-all}} category {{refers to}} other seabird strategies that involve the next <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds {{that make a}} part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of the}} diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.|$|E
5|$|The diet of oviraptorids {{has been}} {{interpreted}} in various ways since the time Oviraptor was wrongly {{thought to have been}} a predator of eggs. It has been suggested that oviraptorosaurs as a whole were herbivores, which is supported by the gastroliths (stomach stones) found in Caudipteryx, and the wear facets in the teeth of Incisivosaurus. In 2010 Longrich and colleagues found that oviraptorid jaws had features similar to those seen in herbivorous tetrapods (four-limbed animals), especially those of dicynodonts, an extinct group of synapsid stem-mammals. Oviraptorids and dicynodonts share features such as short, deep, and toothless mandibles; elongated dentary symphyses; elongated mandibular fenestrae; and a downwards-projecting bar in the palate. Modern animals with jaws that resemble those of oviraptorids include parrots and tortoises; the latter group also has tooth-like projections on their premaxillae. Longrich and colleagues concluded that due to the similarities between oviraptorids and herbivorous animals, the bulk of their diet would most likely have been formed by plant matter. Oviraptorids are found at high frequencies in the formations they are known from, similar to the pattern seen in dinosaurs that are known to be herbivorous; these animals were more abundant than carnivorous dinosaurs, as more energy was available at their lower <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> in the food chain. The jaws of oviraptorids may have been specialised for processing food, such as xerophytic vegetation (adapted for environments with little water), that would have grown in their environment, but this is not possible to demonstrate, as {{little is known about the}} flora of the area at the time. A 2013 study by Lü and colleagues found that oviraptorids appear to have retained their hind limb proportions throughout ontogeny (growth), which is also a pattern mainly seen in herbivorous animals.|$|E

50|$|As {{noted in}} the {{previous}} sections, the lentic biota are linked in complex web of trophic relationships. These organisms can be considered to loosely be associated with specific trophic groups (e.g. primary producers, herbivores, primary carnivores, secondary carnivores, etc.). Scientists have developed several theories {{in order to understand}} the mechanisms that control the abundance and diversity within these groups. Very generally, top-down processes dictate that the abundance of prey taxa is dependent upon the actions of consumers from higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> Typically, these processes operate only between two <b>trophic</b> <b>levels,</b> with no effect on the others. In some cases, however, aquatic systems experience a trophic cascade; for example, this might occur if primary producers experience less grazing by herbivores because these herbivores are suppressed by carnivores. Bottom-up processes are functioning when the abundance or diversity of members of higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> is dependent upon the availability or quality of resources from lower levels. Finally, a combined regulating theory, bottom-up:top-down, combines the predicted influences of consumers and resource availability. It predicts that <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> close to the lowest <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> will be most influenced by bottom-up forces, while top-down effects should be strongest at top levels.|$|R

25|$|Usually {{relative}} species abundances {{are described}} {{for a single}} <b>trophic</b> <b>level.</b> Because such species occupy the same <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> they will potentially or actually compete for similar resources.

25|$|Trophic cascades {{occur when}} predators {{in a food}} web {{suppress}} the abundance or alter the behavior of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> is a herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, smaller fish that eat zooplankton, should decrease.

25|$|The <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> of an {{organism}} is the position it occupies {{on the food}} chain. Fisheries have been systematically overfishing high trophic predatory fish.

According to the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly, if fishing down the food web continues it will in time reduce people to a diet of jellyfish sandwiches and plankton soup.|$|E
25|$|Trophic cascades {{occur when}} predators {{in a food}} chain {{suppress}} the abundance of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> is an herbivore). For example, if the abundance of large piscivorous fish is increased in a lake, the abundance of their prey, zooplanktivorous fish, should decrease, large zooplankton abundance should increase, and phytoplankton biomass should decrease. This theory has stimulated new research {{in many areas of}} ecology. Trophic cascades may also be important for understanding the effects of removing top predators from food webs, as humans have done in many places through hunting and fishing activities.|$|E
25|$|Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin feuded {{that the}} {{ecological}} communities acted as food chains with three trophic levels.

The difficulty arises because organisms at higher <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> are longer lived, with important variability in abundance and distribution at basin and decadal scales.

40|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of ecosystems}} worldwide is changing because of species loss due to human-caused extinctions and species gain through intentional and accidental introductions.

These opposing changes thus alter the shape of marine food webs from a trophic pyramid capped by a diverse array of predators and consumers to a shorter, squatter configuration dominated by filter feeders and scavengers. The consequences of the simultaneous loss of diversity at top <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> and gain at lower <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> is largely unknown.

The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero. Ecologists identify feeding relations and organize species into trophic species through extensive gut content analysis of different species.

25|$|Human {{activities}} can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997), which {{occur when the}} predators that limit abundance of prey and thereby enhance survival of the next lower <b>trophic</b> <b>level</b> are depleted (Strong 1992).

Trophic cascades occur across {{a minimum of three}} trophic levels and can impact community dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998). Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into barrens (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005). Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of energy transfer through food chains [food chain efficiency (FCE) ] {{is an important}} ecosystem function. It has been hypothesized that FCE across multiple <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> is constrained by the efficiency at which herbivores use plant energy, which depends on plant nutritional quality. Furthermore, the number of <b>trophic</b> <b>levels</b> may also constrain FCE, because herbivores are less efficient in using plant production when they are constrained by carnivores. These hypotheses have not been tested experimentally in food chains with 3 or more <b>trophic</b> <b>levels.</b> In a field experiment manipulating light, nutrients, and food-chain length, we show that FCE is constrained by algal food quality and food-chain length.
