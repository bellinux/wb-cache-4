5|$|Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips {{published}} The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, {{presenting a}} challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence. With reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become indifferent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E

5|$|On 15 April 1945, the Nazi {{governor}} (Reichskommissar) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, {{offered to}} open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease {{the suffering of the}} civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss-Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell, in contrast, {{believes}} that Brown portrays his women as acting heroically: {{she notes that}} Clotel escapes {{and goes back to}} Virginia to rescue her daughter, and more than one escape is described. She thinks he emphasizes adventure for the sake of character development. Even after heroic action, Brown's women are subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of slavery. He emphasizes its evil of illegitimacy, and the arbitrary breakup of families.|$|E

Fausold rejects the notion that the two nominees were similar ideologically, pointing to differences between the two on federal spending on public works, agricultural issues, Prohibition, and the tariff.|$|E

As a young boy, {{he was aware}} of the desire of Sultán `Abdu'l-Hamíd (reigned 1876-1909) to banish `Abdu'l-Bahá to the deserts of North Africa where he was expected to perish. At one point, Shoghi Effendi was warned not to drink coffee in the homes of any of the Bahá'ís in the fear that he would be poisoned.|$|E
25|$|The Knesset {{established}} this observance in 2014. The {{purpose of}} this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of Mizrahi Jews during the period around {{the establishment of the}} State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of European Jewry during the Holocaust and in comparison to the Palestinian Nakba. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.|$|E

25|$|As a {{journalist}} his attention was attracted {{in the first}} place <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the tenant farmers. Now {{on the staff of the}} Freeman's Journal, after touring the Galtee Mountains around Christmas 1877 he published articles describing their conditions, which later appeared in pamphlet form. With this action he first displayed his belief that only through parliamentary reform and with the new power of the press that public opinion could be influenced to pursue Irish issues constitutionally through open political activity and the ballot box. Not least of all, responding to the hopes of the new Irish Home Rule movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Rav Lau had {{an hour-long}} meeting with John Paul II at the Pope's summer {{residence}} of Castel Gandolfo near Rome sought {{to offer the}} Vatican's moral support to the latest peace moves in the Middle East. The visit was the first between a Pope and one of Israel's chief rabbis since {{the founding of the}} Jewish state in 1948. In 2009, he was critical of a speech given by Pope Benedict XVI during a visit to Israel. He later applauded a new papal statement which gave more emphasis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{abuse of}} WSLF and the government's indifference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of Isaaq civilians and nomads prompted many Isaaq army officers to desert the army {{with a view}} to creating their own armed movement to fight Ethiopia, one that would also intimidate the WSLF and discourage further violence against Isaaq civilians. Their new movement, supported and financed by Isaaqs, was named Afraad (the fourth unit) and became operational in 1979. The Isaaq movement of Afraad immediately came into conflict with the Ogaden clan's faction of WSLF {{in the form of a}} number of bloody encounters between the two groups. Afraad's objective was to push the WSLF out of their strongholds (Isaaq territory) whereas the WSLF responded by retaliating further against Isaaq civilians living in the border region.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{humanitarian organisation}} Médecins Sans Frontières originated in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, {{in addition to}} Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, {{when he returned to}} France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E
25|$|Government corruptions and {{inadequate}} labour protection legislation {{in developing countries}} have also contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, {{which is also a}} serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012), governments in the developing countries often fail to enforce safety standards in local factories because of corruptions and weak law enforcement. These weaknesses allow factories to provide dangerous working conditions for their workers. With reference to the Corruption Perception Index 2016 (2017), those countries with high risk of corruption such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and China are reported to have larger numbers of unsafe garments factories operating inside the countries. When Zamen (2012) said “corruption kills”, sweatshops in developing countries would be the prime cases.|$|E
500|$|Most critics today {{agree that}} Rabelais wrote from a Christian humanist perspective.
