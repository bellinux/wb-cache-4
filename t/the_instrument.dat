5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E

40|$|A {{mounting}} {{platform for}} heat producing instruments operated {{in a narrow}} equilibrium temperature range comprises a grid-like structure with relatively large openings therein. <b>The</b> <b>instruments</b> are secured to and thermally coupled with the grid surface facing <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> Excess heat from <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> is selectively radiated to the ambient through openings in the grid, the grid surfaces at these openings exhibiting low thermal emissivity and adsorptivity. The remainder of the grid is maintained at the equilibrium temperature and {{is covered with a}} thermal insulating blanket. Thus, the entire system including <b>the</b> platform and <b>instruments</b> is maintained substantially isothermal, whereby <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> remain in fixed physical relationship to one another...|$|R
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> constructed, <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{argued that}} {{appreciation}} of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience. He attributed the lack of sarangi students {{to a lack of}} competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> The Pt (Pandit) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students. Narayan has stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive and said he would never give up promoting <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E

The researcher read <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> and checked <b>the</b> responses while the mothers had a copy of <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> to accompany <b>the</b> reading. This procedure was adopted to deal with potential difficulties or fatigue that the reading could produce in the mothers, given their level of education or potential depressive symptoms, though the mothers presented a minimum level of literacy that enabled them to understand the questions posed by <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> {{the means by which}} music is produced with <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> the range of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate pneumatic valves throughout <b>the</b> <b>instrument.</b> This allowed a lighter touch, and {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean DubÃ© and Olivier Latry.|$|E

5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products.

Production was moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, and the instruments rebranded Besson.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for <b>the</b> <b>instrument.,</b> and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800â1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation.|$|E
