In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of <b>this</b> <b>epidemic</b> remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E

25|$|The Black Death was {{the first}} {{occurrence}} of the , which would continue to strike England {{and the rest of}} Europe more or less regularly until the eighteenth century. The first serious recurrence in England came in the years 1361−62. We know less about the death rates caused by these later outbreaks, but this so-called pestis secunda may have had a mortality of around 20%. <b>This</b> <b>epidemic</b> was also particularly devastating for the population's ability to recover, since it disproportionately affected infants and young men. This was also the case with the next occurrence, in 1369, where the death rate was around 10−15%.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to <b>this</b> <b>epidemic</b> also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|Around 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period {{gave way}} to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate {{resulted}} in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by <b>this</b> <b>epidemic</b> range from one third to as much as sixty percent. By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to perhaps no {{more than a third of}} what it was a century earlier. The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), many {{towns and}} areas of the Circum-Baltic and East-Central Europe {{suffered}} from a severe outbreak of the plague with a peak from 1708 to 1712. <b>This</b> <b>epidemic</b> was probably part of a pandemic affecting an area from Central Asia to the Mediterranean. Most probably via Constantinople, it spread to Pińczów in southern Poland, where it was first recorded in a Swedish military hospital in 1702. The plague then followed trade, travel and army routes, reached the Baltic coast at Prussia in 1709, affected areas all around the Baltic Sea by 1711 and reached Hamburg by 1712. Therefore, {{the course of the}} war and the course of the plague mutually affected each other: while soldiers and refugees were often agents of the plague, the death toll in the military as well as the depopulation of towns and rural areas sometimes severely impacted the ability to resist enemy forces or to supply troops.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., about 28% of the {{population}} suffered, and 500,000 to 675,000 died. Native American tribes were particularly hard hit. In the Four Corners area alone, 3,293 deaths were registered among Native Americans. Entire villages perished in Alaska. The influenza epidemic across the Seward Peninsula in 1918 and 1919 wiped out about 50 percent of the native population of Nome (later an epidemic diphteria during 1925 serum run to Nome), and 8 percent of the native population of Alaska. More than 1,000 people died in northwest Alaska, and double that across the state, and the majority were Alaska Natives. The Alaska Natives had no resistance to either of these diseases. Native tribes had no immunity. As a result of epidemics, the Yup'ik world would go upside down; it would end. From there it spread like a wildfire to all corners of Alaska, killing up to 60 percent of the Eskimo and Alaskan Athabaskan people with the least exposure to the white man. <b>This</b> <b>epidemic</b> killed whole families and wiped out whole villages. Many Kuskuqvamiut also migrated to Bristol Bay region from the Kuskokwim River region {{to the north of}} Bristol Bay, especially after the influenza epidemic of 1918-19.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the plague had retreated from Europe, making a last {{appearance}} in Northern Germany in 1682 and vanishing from the continent in 1684. The subsequent wave hitting Europe during the Great Northern War most probably had {{its origins in}} Central Asia, spreading to Europe via Anatolia and Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Georg Sticker numbered <b>this</b> <b>epidemic</b> as the [...] "12th period" [...] of plague epidemics, first recorded in Ahmedabad in 1683 and until 1724 affecting a territory from India over Persia, Asia Minor, the Levant and Egypt to Nubia and Ethiopia {{as well as to}} Morocco and southern France {{on the one hand and}} to East Central Europe up to Scandinavia on the other hand. Constantinople was reached in 1685 and remained a site of infection for the subsequent years.

2500|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the worst wildlife diseases in recent history that is currently decimating North American cave-hibernating bat populations. <b>This</b> <b>epidemic</b> is responsible for mass mortalities in hibernating North American bats, and is caused by a uniquely cold-adapted fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus begins to grow on bats during the winter hibernation season, when bats are in torpor and immune-compromised. The body temperature of a hibernating bat is the optimal fungal growth environment. The fungus has affected 90% of species that hibernate in caves for the winter. Pseudogymnoascus destructans spores have been found growing on the Virginia big-eared bat. To date, no WNS mortality in this species has been observed although the syndrome has killed millions of its fellow cave-dwelling species. [...] It is currently thought that the Big Ears may have a natural immunity to WNS through a yeast that the bat 'combs' over their body that inhibits the growth of the WNS fungus.|$|E

2500|$|Other legal {{factors that}} have been {{implemented}} to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child. Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions {{have been taken to}} end <b>this</b> <b>epidemic,</b> child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. [...] Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. [...] In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing {{an important role in the}} African economy, child labour still plays an important role for many in the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The sequel {{takes place}} 10 {{years after the}} events of the first game. While {{organized}} crime has been quelled in Pacific City, a terrorist group calling themselves the Cell started a revolt to overthrow the Agency who has taken control of the city. The Cell's leader and former Agency scientist named Catalina Thorne released a deadly strain of [...] "Freak" [...] virus that infected many citizens and turned them into mindless monsters called Freaks. The Agency tried to stop <b>this</b> <b>epidemic</b> by building Project Sunburst, a weapon that used sunlight to destroy Freaks. However, the Cell took control of Project Sunburt's generators before the Agency can unleash it. This forced the Agency to send out their newer and better equipped Agent to combat both the Cell and the Freaks. The Agent managed to retake the generators from the Cell, but when he tried to activate the main beacon, Thorne appeared in a helicopter and tried to destroy it. The Agent then sacrificed himself by jumping into the helicopter's blades, severely damaging it and forcing Thorn to retreat. Project Sunburst successfully destroyed all Freaks in Pacific City and the place was finally safe at last. A post-credit cut-scene showed Thorn surviving the crash and studying a severed hand from the Agent.|$|E
