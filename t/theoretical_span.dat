40|$|Truss light {{steel is}} a modern {{technology}} of roof truss made of a thin plate of zinc-alum which is designed by computers and manufactured by machines. Truss light steel can be an alternative choice to support the roof {{to be able to}} deal with the extreme weather conditions, not to be distracted from termite attack and to be held longer than truss form wood. From its material, there are some weaknesses of light steel, among other are buckling and deflection occurs, so that a review was made of the failure that will occur in some spans and truss forms. SolidWorks is a Computer Aided Design (CAD) 3 D program using the Windows operating system. SolidWorks program can provide the simulation and compute the forces that arise in structures which designed by using finite element method. The use of SolidWorks program shows the simulation of failure mode that will occur, so it can be the input for the planning and construction of the better light steel.

The research is focused on the existing bridge structures, which do not satisfy the traffic loads carrying capacity criterion. So, a bridge near village Kolárovice was observed. It is a six beams RC bridge structure with <b>theoretical</b> <b>span</b> 10. 006 m, which do not satisfy the load-carrying capacity. Thus, it is needed to strengthen the bridge. The use of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials (lamellas and sheets) is one of ways of strengthening of concrete bridges. Firstly, the strengthening is applied on the set of specimens of the T-beam in scale 1 : 3. The static and dynamic load is applied on the specimens. The dynamic load is representing the real traffic load on the bridge structure.

The model is empirically tested using the most recent period mortality data for the total, male and female populations of Portugal and Spain.

40|$|The unique {{chemical}} and physical properties of liquid water are {{a direct result}} of its highly directional hydrogen-bond (HB) network structure and associated dynamics. However, despite intense experimental and <b>theoretical</b> scrutiny <b>spanning</b> more than four decades, a coherent description of this HB network remains elusive. The essential question of whether continuum or multicomponent (“intact,” “broken bond,” etc.) models best describe the HB interactions in liquid water has engendered particularly intense discussion. Most notably, the temperature dependence of water's Raman spectrum has long been considered to be among the strongest evidence for a multicomponent distribution. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we show here that many of the features of the Raman spectrum that are considered to be hallmarks of a multistate system, including the asymmetric band profile, the isosbestic (temperature invariant) point, and van't Hoff behavior, actually result from a continuous distribution. Furthermore, the excellent agreement between our newly remeasured Raman spectra and our model system further supports the locally tetrahedral description of liquid water, which has recently been called into question [Wernet, P., et al.

40|$|Two literatures exist {{concerning}} {{cross-border merger}} activity's impact on domestic wages: one focusing on positive spillover-effects; the other focusing on negative bargaining-effects. Motivated by scarce <b>theoretical</b> scholarship <b>spanning</b> these literatures, we nest both mechanisms {{in a single}} conceptual framework. Considering the separate phenomena of inward and outward cross-border merger activity, our theoretical model generates three formal propositions: cross-border mergers can lead to wage increases via positive spillover-effects; and negative bargaining-effects are relatively more dominant when union market power is high, and when merging firms exhibit relatedness. Employing US firm-level panel data on wages combined with industry-level data on unionization and merger activity (covering 1989 - 2001), we find support for our propositions as inward and outward cross-border merger activity generate positive spillovers to wages, but {{are more likely to}} generate firm-level wage decreases when unionization rates are high and when cross-border merger activity is characterized as horizontal. Accordingly, future research on how cross-border mergers affect domestic wages should be mindful that both spillover and bargaining effects are at play, and that the degree of union market-power and the relatedness of cross-border merger activity are critical in determining which effect dominates.
