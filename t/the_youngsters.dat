5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. <b>The</b> <b>youngsters</b> are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series. During a school trip, <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> find an alien in distress and have to help it without revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends. This notion was conceived as a 'Sarah Jane-lite' narrative which would allow Elisabeth Sladen a break in production.|$|E

Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides {{to make a deal}} with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison.|$|E

5|$|While {{discussing}} typical Bollywood soundtracks, Nilanjana Bhattacharjya, {{a professor}} of music at Colorado College, noted that Rahman integrated traditional Punjabi cultural elements within his music for this soundtrack. Regionally defined elements such as a woman's prayer at the Sikh Gurdwara (Golden Temple) and the bhangra harvest dance are incorporated alongside more contemporary, global styles such as hard rock and hip hop to depict the cosmopolitan lifestyle of <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> in the film.|$|E
5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained {{to become a part}} of the club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for <b>the</b> <b>youngsters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{struggled}} in the 1961–62 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad {{was filled with}} journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates {{of which would be}} Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but made sure he put in extra effort to make <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.|$|E

5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Youngster</b> is of wood with the fuselage {{built in a}} Warren Truss covered with a 1/8 in birch plywood skin. The fuselage employs longitudinal stringers to replicate the Jungmeister's shape. The wings and tail are covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings feature interplane struts, cabane struts, bottom wing ailerons only and a NACA 2315 airfoil. Like the original Jungmeister upon which it is based, <b>the</b> <b>Youngster</b> has no flaps. <b>The</b> <b>Youngster's</b> main landing gear has bungee suspension. The cockpit can be left open or covered with an optional canopy for cold weather operations. The company claims an amateur builder can complete the aircraft from the kit in 500 hours.|$|R

In August 1944, Merten further evacuated 50,000 civilians with his flotilla.|$|E
25|$|The {{dismissal}} of Kaif, however, brought {{a sense of}} haste to the Indian side. Dhoni slashed sixes off <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> Prosper Utseya and Ireland, needing only 39 balls to reach his fifty, which he did with a straight hit off Blignaut over the boundary fence for six. Trying to make another one in the very last over, he mistimed it slightly, and Blessing Mahwire could hold the catch. Ireland got another wicket, that of Ajit Agarkar, and so ended with figures of three for 54 – despite seven wides.|$|E

If they are tackled then they must immediately throw it in the air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|E

25|$|Cercle {{could not}} {{maintain}} {{the results of}} their championship season, ending 7th in 1931. New title aspirations disappeared completely as Cercle continued to finish {{in the middle of the}} league over the next several seasons. The experienced players who had helped achieve the title retired or left the team, and <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> who replaced them could not match their talent. The downward spiral reached a low with relegation to the Belgian Second Division in 1936. Cercle took the opportunity to make sweeping changes, appointing a new coach and board. The changes proved successful, and Cercle won promotion back to the highest division after only two years.|$|E

John Paul joined other brothers and sisters already living in California. Pedro Nuno left to the Congo. Geraldo went to Angola and Clotilde went to Mozambique. On the account of Andrée`s spending habits, Sousa Mendes also started to have disputes with his brothers Cesar and Joao Paulo and his cousin Silverio.|$|E

Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave <b>the</b> <b>youngsters</b> a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers.
