5|$|The Lebaudy Patrie was a {{semi-rigid}} airship built for <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army</b> in Moisson, France, by sugar producers Lebaudy Frères.

40|$|Research is {{currently}} being prepared and initiated to analyse <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army’s</b> military leadership perspective, {{and in the process}} researchers are interested in how other leadership theories would be applicable in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army’s</b> officer education. <b>The</b> purpose of this thesis is to highlight the perspective of a national Swedish military leadership theory in an international environment, and to study if the Swedish theory of Developmental leadership is also applicable outside a Swedish military educational context, specifically during <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army’s</b> officer education. <b>The</b> research consisted of a qualitative literature analysis on a French doctrinal document, an observation and eight in-depth interviews, in order to establish to what extent the Swedish theory of Developmental leadership could be applied in <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army’s</b> officer education. <b>The</b> author found that the Swedish theory of Developmental leadership could be applied as a good <b>French</b> <b>army</b> military leadership, as far as several of the informants and parts <b>the</b> <b>French</b> doctrinal document were concerned. However, the author also found a lack of leadership theory, regarding <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>army’s</b> military leadership and gives four suggestions on further research on the subject.
