40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to isolate the}} conditions {{that give rise to}} loss leader pricing. I show that for sufficiently low distance between firms, <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> good is priced below cost irrespective of whether firms <b>advertise</b> <b>the</b> same or different products. Instead, if products are sufficiently differentiated, loss leader pricing may result only if firms <b>advertise</b> <b>the</b> low reservation value product, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> good is a low margin leader. Thus, whether <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> good is a loss leader or a low margin leader is primarily a function of the extent of differentiation between competing firms. ...|$|R

Because lottery associations <b>advertise</b> <b>the</b> jackpot to be {{the nominal}} sum of these payments, lottery associations can {{increase the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> jackpot sim-ply by increasing the annuity length. Because ticket sales increase with the size of <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> jackpot, longer annuity lengths should lead to higher ticket sales.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of selling prices of apartments, apartment buildings and building lands in the Municipality of Trebnje during the years 2010 and 2015. Generalized market value of the aforementioned housing types in the Municipality of Trebnje is analyzed for the years 2010 and 2014. In the concluding part, the difference between selling prices and generalized market values of the housing types in question is analyzed. Analysis shows that in the year 2010, most apartments were sold at a higher price than <b>the</b> prices <b>advertised</b> by GURS, while in 2014, the majority of apartments which were below <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> generalized market value, had been sold. Similarly, in 2010, most apartment buildings were sold at a higher selling price than <b>the</b> prices <b>advertised</b> by GURS. In 2014, half of the apartment buildings were sold for less than <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> generalized market value, while the second half were sold for more than <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> prices set by GURS. In 2010, building lands were sold below the generalized market value in the majority of cases. In 2014, half of all building lands were sold for less than <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> generalized market value, while the other half were sold for more. The analysis shows that <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> generalized market value can act as the basis for property tax. However, it would be necessary to study why in some instances, the selling prices are lower than the generalized market value...|$|R

40|$|Research on musical “fit” {{suggests}} that listeners might recall {{more of a}} radio advertisement if it features musical/voice content that corresponds with features of <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> brand. This is because the music/voice should prime certain aspects of listeners’ knowledge. Two {{studies were carried out}} to test this, each involving 5 specially prepared radio ads. The first indicated that musical fit enhanced recall of <b>the</b> products <b>advertised,</b> <b>the</b> brands <b>advertised,</b> and specific claims made {{during the course of the}} ad copy; and also participants’ ratings of liking for the ad and likelihood of purchasing <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> product. A second similar study considered voice fit and found that this could also promote recall of specific product claims and lead to higher ratings of liking for the ad and likelihood of purchasing <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> product. These results confirm that both musical and voice fit can prime certain aspects of listeners’ knowledge and also increase liking for ads, such that it might improve knowledge-based and affective responses to <b>advertising.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical implications of this are discussed in terms of the concept of involvement and what precisely is meant by musical/voice fit...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: With {{regard to}} the fact that people usually try to avoid {{repetitive}} and boring advertisements, creativity as <b>the</b> heart of <b>advertising</b> effectiveness has a significant role in drawing their attention. On this basis, the present study attempts to evaluate the influence of creative advertising strategies by comparing “in-store” and “out-of-store” creative advertisements. Design/methodology/approach: This research has been conducted in Tehran (capital of Iran) and 588 volunteers randomly participated in the survey so as to examine the consumers’ attitude/behaviour towards <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> brand, advertised product, and purchases intention exposing creative in-store and out-of-store advertisements. In the current study, creative “end-of-aisle display stands” in grocery stores/supermarkets represent in-store advertising media, and creative “TV commercials” represent out-of-store advertising. Furthermore to examine the hypotheses, one-sample t-test and paired sample t-test were used. Findings: The results show that creative out-of-store advertising has influence primarily on attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> brand, then on attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> product, and finally on the purchases intention. On the other hand, creative in-store advertising, firstly has influence on the purchase intention, then on attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> brand, and lastly on attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>advertised</b> product. <b>The</b> findings provide important insights to the formulation of strategic marketing/advertising and would pave the related innovative ways to capitalize on strategic opportunities. Originality/value: The study is the first survey comparing the effectiveness of in-store and out-of-store creative advertising in order to find out a strategic marketing/advertising solution...|$|R
