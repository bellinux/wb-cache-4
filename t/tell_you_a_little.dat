2500|$|... "I should, perhaps, Madame, <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more about}} myself. I am Hercule Poirot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I have to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> chill in my legs right now. That {{is an amazing}} moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. And the reason I say that is because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry," [...] the old soldier began, {{as quietly}} as he was able, after an awkward pause, [...] "I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little--a <b>little</b> about your father and mother." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Rosy, dear," [...] {{said the}} worthy relict, {{as soon as}} she saw Mulford stretch his fine frame on his bed of canvas, {{speaking}} {{at the same time in}} a low, confidential tone to her niece, [...] "what was it that Harry was <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while ago? It sounded to me like rank nonsense; and men will talk nonsense to young girls, as I have so often warned you, child. You must never listen to their nonsense, Rosy; but remember your catechism and confirmation vow, and be a good girl." ...|$|R
2500|$|I think you're {{a pretty}} smart boy. I may not talk very good, Mister, but I {{know how to}} take care of smart boys. Let me tell you something. Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> secret. I hate your guts, you college son-of-a-bitch! You think you're better than I am! You think you're better because you've had {{everything}} handed to you. Let me tell you something, Mister – I've worked since I was ten years old, and all my life I've known you superior bastards. I knew you people when I was a kid in Boston and I worked in eating-places and you ordered me around … [...] "Oh bus-boy! My friend here seems to have thrown up on the table. Clean it up, please!" [...] I started going to sea as a steward and I worked for you then … [...] "Steward, take my magazine out to the deck chair!" [...] … [...] "Steward, I don't like your looks. Please keep out of my way as much as possible!" [...] Well, I took that crap! I took that for years from pimple-faced bastards who weren't good enough to wipe my nose! And now I don't have to take it any more! There's a war on, by God, and I'm the Captain and you can wipe my nose! The worst thing I can do to you is to keep you on this ship! And that's where you're going to stay! Now get out of here.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I refuse," [...] he answered, [...] "it {{may give}} you a false impression. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> if I may. A few {{sentences}} will be enough." ...|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{secret about}} how I {{came to be}} here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most {{particular}} reason.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{plan that}} <b>you</b> can work, Dick. I don't like the fellow myself, {{and it will}} delight me to see you {{get the best of}} him." ...|$|R
50|$|You wash ashore onto Redjack Island {{where you}} explore {{the island and}} get inside a {{monument}} of sorts and find out that Redjack is there, sitting dead watching the ocean. <b>You</b> light <b>a</b> fire signal and are found by <b>a</b> balloon ship. <b>You</b> are then taken to Blackbeard's fortress and request an audience with him after making him <b>a</b> drink. He <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about the mythology of the brethren but is knocked unconscious {{in the middle of}} it by Bone and his men. You fight the men and kill Bone and set sail for Cartagena.|$|R
60|$|JOHN. Here's another lucky thing, Maggie: I hadn't {{told the}} ladies' {{committee}} that I was to hedge, {{and so they}} need never know. Comtesse, I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cherub who sits up aloft and looks after the career of John Shand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he answered, [...] "you are Mr. James B. Watson of New York, and {{the lady}} with you is your wife. Now I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later on," [...] he said. [...] "Everything will be {{arranged}} all right. The only thing I am wondering about {{is whether it}} wouldn't be better to close up at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The men {{who killed}} him," [...] I answered, [...] "thought {{that they had}} killed me. It's a long story, Gilbert. I've come here to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of it, if you can spare the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|He held up {{his hands}} in humorous protest: [...] "Ah, my darling, here's your vivid {{imagination}} again, making mountains out of molehills, as they say! It's nothing half so serious as you seem to think; I have only to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> change." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's easily said!' {{answered}} the crow, 'but {{how are we}} to manage that? I must talk it over with my tame sweetheart. She may be able to advise us, for I must <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl like <b>you</b> could never get permission to enter it.' ...|$|R
3000|$|Can <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> us <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{bit more}} about those traps – the {{standard}} evolutionary traps – {{when it comes to}} learning from experience? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "While {{you finish}} your stints I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{story about the}} Indians," [...] said Miss Celia, lying back on her cushions, while the needles began to go again, for the {{prospect}} of a story could not be resisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{secured the}} {{acquittal}} of Oliver Hilditch," [...] she persisted. [...] "He is {{by this time}} a free man. Now I am going {{to speak to you}} of that responsibility. I am going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about the man who owes his freedom to your eloquence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nelly {{sat beside}} her mother picking lint; but while her fingers flew, her eyes often looked wistfully out into the meadow, golden with buttercups, and bright with sunshine. Presently she said, rather bashfully, but very earnestly, [...] "Mamma, I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> plan I've made, if you'll please not laugh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> very <b>little</b> just to {{save you}} from Phil, who, if he once begins, will kill you with his calculations. But you can't {{appreciate}} what I say. Let me see. The total number of telegraphic messages forwarded by our offices in the United Kingdom during the last twelve months amounted to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than twenty-two millions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I not <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> {{that within}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> space thou wouldst creep to my knee, oh Kallikrates? And surely the space {{has not been}} a great one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can rely}} upon my silence, my lad, and here's half a guinea to drink my health between you. But can't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to know}} {{something}} {{of this kind of}} thing. I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about myself. Perhaps then you may think better of the purchase." [...] He turned round {{with his back to the}} river, and put his hands in his pockets. He sighed. [...] "I know you will not believe me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was before}} the Paragon had been named for Patagonia. To <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of my own private mind,--which isn't scandal," [...] said Mounser Green, [...] "because it is only given as opinion,--I think it just {{possible}} that the Paragon has taken this very uncomfortable mission because it offered him some chance of escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} Mr. Direck {{was moved by}} an anecdote. [...] "It will help to {{illustrate}} what you are saying, Mr. Britling, about systematic organisation if I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> incident that happened {{to a friend of}} mine in Toledo, where they are setting up a big plant with a view to capturing the entire American and European market in the class of the thousand-dollar car--" ...|$|E
40|$|When {{the time}} came to ask someone to {{introduce}} me, I was sorry to learn that Dr. O. F. Tuttle could not oblige, because he was the obvious choice, but I was pleased when Dr. R. H. Jahns came to my rescue. I know that my new colleagues in Chicago (with three MSA Awards in the department now) do not mind me describing this as a Penn State Award, and I am sure that Dr. Jahns' new colleagues at Stanford do not mind me reclaiming him for Penn State on this occasion. When I learned at the last GSA meeting that I had been erected as the 1965 recipient of the MSA Award I was overcome with the shock of surprise and pleasure. The shock has abated, but I still cannot express my feelings adequately I can only assure the nominating committee and the council that this honor is greatly appreciated-very greatly appreciated. Then, like the previous recipients, I take pleasure in thanking my teachers and associates, and in <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about them...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right then, stay," [...] said Dick. [...] "But take it easy, Tom, {{and do what}} Sam <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to." [...] <b>A</b> <b>little</b> later Dick drew Sam to {{one side}} and asked him to keep a close watch on his brother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now this {{finishes}} the lessons about the land animals or mammals. There are other mammals {{who live in}} the ocean, which is the salt water which surrounds the land, and which, I guess, none of you have ever seen. Some of these come on shore and some never do. To-morrow I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about them, so that you will know something about all the animals of this great country which is called North America. That is, I will if you want me to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{guess is}} right, Chatterer," [...] she replied, {{smiling at the}} little red-coated rascal, [...] "and this morning I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about a {{relative}} of his who doesn't live in a barnyard, but lives in the forest, as free and independent as you are. It is Piggy the Peccary, known as the Collared Peccary, also called Wild Pig, Muskhog, Texas Peccary and Javelina.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Pennycuik, as I {{was going}} to <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> after {{you were born in}} your English workhouse, your kind, honourable, brave country, England, sent an English gentleman, who could not tell a lie, to say that so long as the sun rose and the rivers ran in their courses the Transvaal would belong to England. Did you ever hear that, khaki--eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we're comin'. Shove up {{and make}} room, you Collegers. You've all got to be back next term, with your 'Yes, sir,' and 'Oh, sir,' an' 'No sir' an' 'Please sir'; but before we say good-by we're going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> story. Go on, Dickie" [...] (this to the driver); [...] "we're quite ready. Kick that hat-box under the seat, an' don't crowd your Uncle Stalky." ...|$|E
60|$|Pir. I {{forgot to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> sir, that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> before Don Roderick was brought in, {{a company of}} gentlemen (pursued it seems by justice) {{procured}} our boat to row them hither. Two of them carried a very fair lady betwixt them, who was either dead, or swooned.|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, I {{suppose we}} imagine more evil than really exists, and {{sometimes}} accuse our neighbors wrongfully. But the mother birds know how often their nests have been robbed in their absence, {{and if they}} suspect some neighbor of the crime instead of a prowling animal it is but natural, since many birds cannot be trusted. There are laws in the forest, of course; but the guilty ones are often able to escape. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tragedy that happened only last week, which will prove how apt {{we are to be}} mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Louis," [...] said I, [...] "you need {{have no such}} {{fears about}} me. I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of <b>an</b> adventurer, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of <b>a</b> Bohemian. There is no one else who has a claim upon my life, and I do as I please. Can't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about this mysterious cafe?" ...|$|R
