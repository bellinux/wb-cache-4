2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, {{and it will be a}} very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{causes of}} these {{repeated}} failures {{is that our}} best and greatest men have greatly underestimated {{the size of this}} question.

"And so let {{the subject}} pass," [...] she concluded, [...] "but it saddens me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great sorrows {{of the world}} should be there like a {{monument}} to spoil the wonder of this morning. Now I am {{going to ask you}} a question. Are you the John Strangewey who has recently had a fortune left to him?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{realized}} {{too that}} it is less flattering to compare oneself with the very little things of the world than with the great. Given time, I might scale an Alp; I could only kill an ant. Besides, I am beginning to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleasantest ways of living is in one's memory. How much less afflicting at times would my present have been if I had {{had the foresight to}} remind myself how beguiling it would appear as the past. Even my old sharpest sorrows have now hushed themselves to sleep, and those for whom I have sorrowed are as quiet.|$|E

I'm {{not going to talk}} the usual rot to you about how much you will like it and so on. I sometimes <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantages of Hell will be that no one will have the impertinence to point out to you that you're really better off than you would be anywhere else. What {{do you think of the}} play? Of course one can foresee the end; she will come to her husband with the announcement that their longed-for child is going to be born, and that will smooth over everything. So conveniently effective, to wind up a comedy with the commencement of someone else's tragedy. And every one will go away saying 'I'm glad it had a happy ending.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, then, I {{will tell}} you exactly what we want. We believe that the will is still there, and we believe that if some one in the house were to make a {{thorough}} search it might be found. It is right that it should be found, and that the property should go to those to whom Mr. Penfold left it, and who are now being kept out of it by the Miss Penfolds. I am very much interested in the matter, because it is my son who is being cheated out of his rights; and I have made up my mind to find the will. Now, what I want to know is, do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housemaids would be willing to give up her place and introduce me as her successor, if I gave her twenty-five pounds? That would be a nice little sum, you know, to begin housekeeping with." ...|$|E
60|$|When the Arato {{changed her}} mind about going to Callao, and sailed southward some {{five days after the}} Miranda had started on the same course, she had very good weather for the greater part of a week, and sailed finely. Cardatas, who owned a share in her, had sailed upon her as first mate, but he had never before {{commanded}} her. He was a good navigator, however, and well fitted for the task he had undertaken. He was a sharp fellow, and kept his eyes on everybody, particularly upon Nunez, who, although a landsman, and in no wise capable of sailing a ship, was perfectly capable of making plans regarding any vessel in which he was interested, especially when such a vessel happened to be sailing in pursuit of treasure, the value of which was merely a matter of conjecture. It was not impossible that the horse-dealer, who had embarked money in this venture, might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mariners on board might be able to sail the schooner as well as Cardatas, and would not expect so large a share of the profits should the voyage be successful. But when the storms came on, Nunez grew sick and unhappy, and retired below, and he troubled the mind of Cardatas no more for the present.|$|E
6000|$|One of papa's latest {{books is}} [...] "The Prince and the Pauper" [...] {{and it is}} [...] unquestionably the best book he has ever written, some people want [...] him to keep to his old style, some gentleman wrote him, [...] "I enjoyed [...] Huckleberry Finn immensely and am {{glad to see that}} you have [...] {{returned}} to your old style." [...] That enoyed me that enoyed me greatly, [...] because it trobles me [Susy was troubled by that word, and [...] uncertain; she wrote a u above it in the proper place, but [...] reconsidered the matter and struck it out] to have so few people [...] know papa, I mean realy know him, they think of Mark Twain as a [...] humorist joking at everything; [...] "And with a mop of reddish brown [...] hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a roman nose, short [...] stubby mustache, a sad care-worn face, with maney crow's feet" [...] etc. [...] That is the way people picture papa, I have wanted papa to write a [...] book that would reveal something of his kind sympathetic nature, [...] and [...] "The Prince and the Pauper" [...] partly does it. The book is full of [...] lovely charming ideas, and oh the language! It is perfect. I [...] <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most touching scenes in it, is where the [...] pauper is riding on horseback with his nobles in the [...] "recognition [...] procession" [...] and he sees his mother oh and then what followed! How [...] she runs to his side, when she sees him throw up his hand palm [...] outward, and is rudely pushed off by one of the King's officers, [...] and then how the little pauper's consceince troubles him when he [...] remembers the shameful words that were falling from his lips, when [...] she was turned from his side [...] "I know you not woman" [...] and how his [...] grandeurs were stricken valueless, and his pride consumed to ashes. [...] It is a wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene, and papa [...] has described it so wonderfully. I never saw a man with so much [...] variety of feeling as papa has; now the [...] "Prince and the Pauper" [...] is [...] full of touching places; but there is most always a streak of humor [...] in them somewhere. Now in the coronation--in the stirring [...] coronation, just after the little king has got his crown back again [...] papa brings that in about the Seal, where the pauper says he used [...] the Seal [...] "to crack nuts with." [...] Oh it is so funny and nice! Papa [...] very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it somewhere, [...] and I dont think he ever will.|$|E

50|$|Unlike his {{subsequent}} This was their finest hour speech, Churchill's 4 June {{speech in the}} House of Commons was not repeated by him as a live radio broadcast that evening.

We’re putting it {{in a sort of}} Sleeping Beauty coffin, a greenhouse we’re building around it. And we’re pumping it up with a life support system—an incredibly complex system of air, humidity, water, and soil enhancement—to keep it going. All those things are substituting what nature does, emphasizing how, once that’s gone, it’s incredibly difficult, expensive, and technological to approximate that system—to take this tree and to build the next generation of forests on it. So, this piece is in some way perverse. It shows that, despite all of our technology and money, when we destroy a natural system, it’s virtually impossible to get it back. In a sense, we’re building a failure." ...|$|E
