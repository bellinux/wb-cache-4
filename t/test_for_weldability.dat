40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} high power fiber laser welding of steel {{material}} for the field of pipe production. X 65 and X 70 steel plate material in thicknesses of 9. 5  mm and 14  mm was welded with laser-GMA-hybrid welding processes with a maximum laser power of 8  kW. Two different filler wires and joint preparations were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> their <b>weldability.</b> Relating to these welding procedures and thicknesses, characterisation of welded samples such as hardness, tensile testing and Charpy V-notch testing were carried out and {{the results will be}} reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{weldability}} {{using the}} electromagnetic {{process has been}} evaluated for different grades of polypropylene copolymers being used for automotive and domestic applications. As previous publications [1 – 2] have revealed, the electromagnetic welding process has demonstrated its robustness on various resins and applications. In this paper, comparative study between the vibration welding process and the electromagnetic welding process has been performed to evaluate effects of filler (talc and glass) content on <b>weldability</b> <b>for</b> polypropylene copolymers. Extensive DOE procedures to optimize the vibration welding process and electromagnetic welding process have been performed. In Ref. [3], a definition of <b>weldability</b> <b>for</b> the material has been suggested. For more conclusive evaluation, both welding strength and failure modes of the welded plaques need to be investigated. The same definition <b>for</b> <b>weldability</b> {{has been used for}} this study. In this study, it has been found that talc and glass content adversely affects weldability, while the electromagnetic welding process showed slightly better performance in welding strengths...|$|R
40|$|TIG welding is a {{very clean}} welding, and {{produces}} high-quality welds. But usually it’s performed manually, so {{that the quality of}} weld depends on the skill of the operator, and there’s not so much theoretical information about what’s happening while, and just after the welding, and how it affects the properties of the welded sample. Extensive literature is available <b>for</b> <b>weldability</b> of conventional materials such as aluminum, titanium or magnesium materials. TIG welding of powder metallurgy steels has not been attempted by many researchers. The aim of this project is to investigate the possibility of welding powder metallurgy alloy steel by TIG welding process. Mo-alloyed low alloy steel with 0. 3...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIndustry and {{research}} have long desired {{the establishment of}} standards <b>for</b> <b>weldability</b> <b>testing</b> in regards to hydrogen assisted cold cracking formation. This would have the obvious advantage of allowing data to be reliably compared between different research labs. But making decisions regarding standards requires some careful thought and agreement on i) how test parameters affect test results, ii) what exactly needs to be measured, and iii) how test results should be interpreted and reported. Our depth of understanding on these points has matured significantly over time and, while there is not always universal agreement, {{it is at least}} possible to start highlighting factors important to standards. This paper examines these factors, including the welding parameters, restraint, hydrogen, and cracking index. When comparing different alloys having different thermal characteristics, the use of constant welding parameters (common practice) will result in variable weld penetration and weld pool shape, which can influence grain shape and microstructural features, which can result in inequitable weldability comparisons. Welding on test coupons having different dimensions can affect restraint, which will influence the residual stresses around the weldment. High restraint usually results in higher crack susceptibility. Also, hydrogen content present in a weldment depends on the thermal history, welding parameters, and surrounding atmosphere humidity; with high hydrogen contents associated to great cracking susceptibility. Finally, the selection of an appropriate cracking index is required for data analysis. Quantifications of crack length and minimum preheat temperature are common indexes used for comparison. Critical stress and hydrogen content are other indexes. But how well these indexes actually represent weldability are contentious issues. This paper will examine and quantify these issues in detail, thus providing the reader with an appreciation of all things that must be considered when preparing a standardized procedure <b>for</b> <b>weldability</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The hot {{ductility}} of Allvac 718 Plus {{for different}} solution heat treatments (954 degrees C- 15 h, 954 degrees C- 1 h, 982 degrees C- 1 h and 1050 degrees C- 3 h+ 954 degrees C- 1 h) {{has been investigated}} using Gleeble testing. Substantial variations in the microstructure among the heat treatments affected the Gleeble test hot ductility only to a very limited extent.

40|$|Type 304 {{stainless}} steel is used in various applications where corrosion resistance is required. This material is selected <b>for</b> <b>weldability</b> and corrosion resistance, but it can suffer stress corrosion cracking (scc), corrosion fatigue, pitting and crevice corrosion in chloride environments. The aim of this project was to produce Type 304 containers with intentional stress corrosion cracks, to serve as <b>test</b> samples <b>for</b> future weld repair trials. A test rig was constructed which used thermal stress to crack Type 304 tube samples; a central Type 310 {{stainless steel}} bar contained a heating element, so that the bar serve as a heat source and a stressing element. The rig was filled or half filled with magnesium chloride solution. The elastic strain in the tube sample was {{directly related to the}} temperature difference between the central bar and the sample. The thermal stress was sufficient to cause stress corrosion cracking. The tests were terminated when the first crack extended through the wall thickness of the 304 tube sample. The distribution and depth of cracks were determined after the tests. The test procedure caused the formation of multiple cracks in the tube sample. The temperature controller caused cyclical variation in the bar temperature and hence in the thermal stress. However, the temperature variation did not have an effect on cracking; corrosion fatigue did not contribute to cracking, and the cracks had the classic branched transgranular morphology of chloride cracking.
