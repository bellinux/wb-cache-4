40|$|This study {{involved}} assessments of therapeutant effects on pollination and fruit set; of temperature effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in apples, peaches and kiwifruits; of flowerage effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in kiwifruit styles; and of hand pollination effects on fruit set, fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit vines. From {{the point of}} view of their in vitro effects on pollen germination therapeutants can be listed in order of decreasing inhibitory effect as follows: (a) for apples - mancozeb plus dinocap, <b>triforine,</b> dichlofluanid, bupirimate, bayleton, citowett R captan and mancozeb; (b) for peaches - <b>triforine,</b> vinclozoline, streptomycin plus <b>triforine,</b> mancozeb, captafol, iprodione, dichlofluanid, streptomycin and benomyl; and (c) for kiwifruits - dichlofluanid, captan and vinclozoline. However, it appeared that while in vitro a therapeutant was very inhibitory, the application of a spray to anthers in an intact flower did not affect the germination of pollen subsequently released by those anthers. Fungicides proven to be toxic to pollen in vitro did not necessarily produce similarly toxic effects in vivo. Reasons for such varying effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo are suggested. At 24 hours after pollination the number of pollen tubes growing more than 1 / 2 the style length of kiwifruit (Hayward) flowers one to two days old were 38 % and 27 % higher than in flowers less than one day old and more than three days old respectively. In apples 5 sprays of either bayleton or captan, 3 sprays of either of the therapeutants mancozeb, mancozeb plus dinocap, and <b>triforine</b> and a wetting agent citowett R applied during bloom period caused no effect in fruit set in Golden Delicious trees; and 3 bupirimate sprays during bloom period had no effect on the fruit set in Splendour trees. In peaches 6 sprays of either captafol, or benomyl or iprodione, 5 sprays of either mancozeb or vinclozoline or streptomycin or <b>triforine</b> during bloom period caused no effect on fruit set in Golden Queen trees. Three sprays of streptomycin or dichlofluanid caused no effect but 3 sprays of <b>triforine,</b> <b>triforine</b> plus streptomycin or of ethephon caused 50 %, 70 % and 90 % reduction in fruit set in Red Haven peach trees. In kiwifruits 3 sprays of either dichlofluanid, captan or vinclozoline reduced seed numbers per fruit by 37 % but did not affect fruit set or fruit weight. Thus in vitro and in vivo studies were useful in determining therapeutant effects on pollen but did not necessarily provide information on their effects on fruit set in apple, peach and kiwifruit and on fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit. The germination of both apple and peach pollen was higher at 24 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C, 28 °C and at 32 °C. After 18 hours incubation pollen tubes were longer at 28 °C and at 32 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C and 24 °C. In vivo studies with kiwifruit (Matua) pollen showed that pollen germination at 14 °C, 18 °C, 22 °C and 26 °C did not differ significantly. Temperatures both higher and lower than the temperature range 18 to 22 °C were found to be inhibitory to pollen tube growth in kiwifruit (Hayward) styles. Hand pollination of flowers did not influence percentage fruit set but increased fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit (Hayward) vines. Because fruit weight was positively correlated with seed number per fruit in fruits from both bee pollinated and bee plus hand pollinated flower clusters, supplementary pollination may play an important role in the production of fruit in kiwifruit orchards...|$|E

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp is an {{indigenous}} food legume in Africa, which has great production potential, especially {{in areas with}} low agricultural resources. During surveys of cowpea fields in southern Africa, a new foliar disease was recorded. Alternaria cassiae Juriar&Khan was consistently isolated from diseased plant material. Pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's Postulates. The effect of different culture media, temperature, light and wounding on the growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. A. cassiae grew well and produced conidia abundantly when maintained on V 8 -agar at 25 °C in a 12 h UV-light/ 12 h dark cycle. Sporulation was further enhanced by wounding the cultures. The pre-penetration and infection process of A. cassiae on cowpea leaves was studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Conidia germinated within 2 - 3 h post inoculation (hpi), forming multiple germ-tubes randomly that grew in any direction across the leaf surface. By 8 hpi terminal or intercalary appressoria were formed above epidermal cells or over stomata. Occasionally germ-tubes entered stomata, without the formation of appressoria. Penetration of the plant surface, whether directly through the epidermis or indirectly through stomata was observed 72 hpi. Following penetration bulbous primary hyphae were observed within the sub-stomatal cavities, secondary hyphae developed from the primary hyphae and grew within the intercellular spaces penetrating epidermis and mesophyll cells. A. cassiae is a necrotrophic fungus as the infection process is characterised by a destructive necrotrophic phase where plant cells became necrotic even prior to fungal penetration. Conidial morphology, types {{and development of the}} fungus were studied in vitro on different culture media and in vivo on cowpea leaves. A. cassiae produced a mixed population of three conidial types. Conidia were formed singly or in chains of 2 - 4 conidia. Conidia with long, filiform beaks and conidia with shorter beaks, converted into secondary conidiophores were more frequently produced than mature, beakless conidia on all the media, except on potato dextrose agar. Conidial body and beak sizes were variable when measured in culture and on cowpea leaves. Conidia produced in culture were larger, than those produced in vivo. Conidiophores emerged directly through the epidermis or stomata or were formed when hyphae growing on the leaf surface differentiated into conidiophores. Smooth, bud-like conidial initials were produced at the apex of conidiophores. Conidia matured and became elliptical to obvate and densely verrucose. Once a mature conidium had detached, a small pore was visible at the apex of the conidiophore. A. cassiae was shown to be seed-borne in cowpea. Six fungicides i. e. Benomyl, bitertanol, captab, mancozeb, propiconazole and <b>triforine</b> were evaluated for their efficacy in reducing mycelial growth of A. cassiae in vitro. All fungicides except benomyl proved to be effective. Cowpea seeds were artificially inoculated with A. cassiae and treated with all the fungicides except benomyl. Percentage germination and infection was determined in vitro. Percentage emergence, disease incidence, root and shoot lengths and abnormalities were determined in greenhouse trials. Only bitertanol at l. 5 x the recommended dosage significantly reduced percentage germination. All treatments except <b>triforine</b> l. 0 x and l. 5 x significantly decreased the percentage infection of artificially inoculated seeds. None of the treatments except bitertanol l. 5 x showed a difference in shoot and root length when compared to the control. Captab l. 5 x the recommended rate proved to be the best treatment over all.

40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and pyrazophos in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. <b>Triforine</b> showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use <b>triforine</b> when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to <b>triforine</b> can be regarded as resistance. In the case of bitertanol, fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of cereal powdery mildew is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of cucumber powdery mildew in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of cucumber powdery mildew...|$|E
