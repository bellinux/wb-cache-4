5|$|The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was {{exempt from}} {{requirements}} {{to have a}} federal environmental impact study (EIS) conducted on the Creek Turnpike project. As part of {{their opposition to the}} turnpike, Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right. The group announced in April 1989 that if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies. Tulsans Against Turnpikes, joined by an area homeowners' association, John Reidel (a homeowner whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits as early as the 1950s to stop the turnpike's construction), and several other affected individuals, filed the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on August 10. Defendants in the suit included <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies,</b> state transportation and environmental agencies, and the city of Tulsa. That November, Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike.|$|E

25|$|In a 2002 study {{exploring}} {{the relationship between}} the CRA and lending looked at as predatory, Kathleen C. Engel and Patricia A. McCoy noted that banks could receive CRA credit by lending or brokering loans in lower-income areas that would be considered a risk for ordinary lending practices. CRA regulated banks may also inadvertently facilitate these lending practices by financing lenders. They noted that CRA regulations, as then administered and carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie MAC, did not penalize banks that engaged in these lending practices. They recommended that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies</b> use the CRA to sanction behavior that either directly or indirectly increased predatory lending practices by lowering the CRA rating of any bank that facilitated in these lending practices.|$|E

25|$|The Old Post Office Building was {{slated for}} {{demolition}} during {{construction of the}} Federal Triangle. In 1926, the United States Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act, which authorized the construction {{not only of the}} Federal Triangle complex of buildings but also a new U.S. Supreme Court building opposite the United States Capitol, a major extension of the U.S. Government Printing Office building on North Capitol Street, and significant widening of B Street NW {{on the north side of}} the National Mall. Government officials, other experts, and the press believed that the demolition of the District Building and Old Post Office Pavilion and the closure of many streets in the area would occur. A Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies</b> developing Federal Triangle on how to proceed. By July 1927, the board had fashioned a general plan for the area, but did not address whether the Old Post Office Pavilion, District Building, or the Southern Railway Building should be torn down or not. Planning for the complex was deeply influenced by the City Beautiful movement and the idea of creating a civic center to achieve efficiency in administration as well as reinforce the public's perception of government as authoritative and permanent. For the architectural style of the buildings, the board adopted the McMillan Plan's recommendation of the Neoclassical style. Rather than a mass of tall, imposing buildings, two unifying open spaces (intended for ceremonial use, and under discussion by the Board at least by March 1928) would be utilized. The first would be a Circular Plaza (inspired by the Place Vendôme) bisected by 12th Street NW, and which would require the demolition of the Old Post Office Pavilion.|$|E

Lehman, Jr. to determine if Rainbow's claim under the Cargo Preference Act was valid, and on 8 August 1985, Lehman declared Rainbow's rates to be [...] "excessive and unreasonable." [...] Within four days, Rainbow pressed suits in United States District Court against [...] "the Department of the Navy and various other federal agencies" [...] as well as [...] "the Secretary of the Navy and various other government officials in their personal capacities."

500|$|On September 12, 2009, the EPB commemorated the {{birthday}} of Albizu. Noting that he died after being jailed, the organization insisted that justice was not yet made, expressing chagrin {{at the idea that}} some of the responsible were now regarded as historically influential people. The EBP then drew a parallel between the death of Albizu and Ojeda Ríos, accusing the local and federal authorities of complicity, as well as some pro-independence organization ms due to their silence on the matter. The group closed by claiming that the General Inspector's report tried to blame Ojeda Ríos for the actions of a FBI squad that [...] "wanted to eliminate the real representative of armed resistance [...] " [...] and compared it to the actions taken during the Romero Barceló administration in regards to the Cerro Maravilla murders, and expressed disbelief that despite cooperating with <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agencies</b> the local government, most notably the Police of Puerto Rico, concluded that the scene was not tampered when they only saw photographic evidence provided by the FBI. Noting that the Civil Rights Commission investigating the case questioned if the scene was tampered, the organization lamented that the report concluded that no criminal charges could be presented against the federal agent identified as [...] "Brian" [...] {{or any of the other}} involved.|$|E
