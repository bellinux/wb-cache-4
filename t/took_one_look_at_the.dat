Christofferson, a neighboring farmer, <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> charred remains of this body and {{said that it was}} not the remains of Belle Gunness. So did another farmer, L. Nicholson, and so did Mrs. Austin Cutler, an old friend of Gunness. More of Gunness' old friends, Mrs. May Olander and Mr. Sigward Olsen, arrived from Chicago. They examined the remains of the headless woman and said it was not Gunness.|$|E
500|$|In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter then details Ashenoff's {{first foray}} in to {{professional}} wrestling: [...] "Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), {{where he was}} led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as “Kiss.” De los Santos <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take –– {{what the hell is}} this guy doing here, and, how quickly can I get this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Maxson, who {{had been}} hired to replace Lamphere in February 1908, awoke {{in the early hours}} of April 28, 1908, smelling smoke in his room, which was on the second floor of the Gunness house. He opened the hall door to a sheet of flames. Maxson screamed Gunness' name and those of her {{children}} but got no response. He slammed the door and then, in his underwear, leapt from the second-story window of his room, barely surviving the fire that was closing in around him. He raced to town to get help, but by the time the old-fashioned hook-and-ladder arrived at the farm at early dawn, the farmhouse was a gutted heap of smoking ruins. Four bodies were found inside the house. [...] One of the bodies was that of a woman who could not immediately be identified as Gunness, since it had no head. The head was never found. The bodies of Gunness' children were found still in their beds. County Sheriff Smutzer had somehow heard about Lamphere’s alleged threats; he <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carnage and quickly sought out the ex-handyman. Leliter came forward to recount his tale about Gunness' will and how she feared Lamphere would kill her and her family and burn her house down.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a {{scriptwriter}} {{on the radio}} production of Burns & Allen. She appeared on nineteen episodes of the show that he had written between 1947 and 1951, {{and became one of}} his regular television players with the first two seasons of Burns & Allen, a two-episode guest appearance as Blanche Morton on The Bob Cummings Show in 1956-57, and then her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for The Beverly Hillbillies, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan would win the part; according to Henning, [...] "Bea <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way Irene did the part and said to me, 'There's your Granny!'" [...] He additionally took Benaderet's suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny's rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962-63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts' Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt & Scruggs, who performed the show's opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled [...] "Pearl Pearl Pearl", and Benaderet was pictured with the duo on the single's cover. Benaderet described Pearl's curly hair as [...] "just my mental image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. She could read and write, and the curled hair seemed to Pearl the height of smartness." [...] Her performance as Pearl was well received; author Stephen Cox wrote in his 1993 book The Beverly Hillbillies: From the Small Screen to the Big Screen: [...] "When The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it started to become 'The Bea Benaderet Show.' Every scene that had Cousin Pearl in it was just about stolen by the actress." ...|$|E

60|$|On Gomez {{coming up}} to him, Jasper raised one hand to point at his own throat. Gomez noted the {{somewhat}} soiled state of his white clothes, then <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his face, and fled away to order the drink for which Jasper seemed to be asking.|$|R
60|$|But the {{carriage}} {{did go to}} the Bon Marché, and there also went the cab, the two vehicles arriving at almost the same time. Banker paid his fare with great promptness, {{and was on the}} pavement {{in time to see the}} handsomely dressed lady descend and enter the establishment. As she went in, he <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of her bonnet. It had a little green feather in it. Then he turned quickly upon Cheditafa, who had shut {{the carriage}} door and was going around behind it in order to get up on the other side.|$|E
60|$|The {{men looked}} about them. The bear {{took a couple}} of steps forward, still {{growling}} menacingly. He was exposed to the shoulders now. Tippet <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> monster and bolted for the nearest tree; and then the bear charged. He charged straight for Tippet. The other men scattered for the various trees they had selected--all except Bradley. He stood watching Tippet and the bear. The man had a good start and the tree was not far away; but the speed of the enormous creature behind him was something to marvel at, yet Tippet was in a fair way to make his sanctuary when his foot caught in a tangle of roots and down he went, his rifle flying from his hand and falling several yards away. Instantly Bradley's piece was at his shoulder, there was a sharp report answered by a roar of mingled rage and pain from the carnivore. Tippet attempted to scramble to his feet.|$|E
60|$|She had fondly {{thought that}} when she called on her friends to come at twelve, and {{specially}} begged them {{to believe that she}} meant it, {{she would be able to}} see them comfortably seated in their tents at two. Vain woman--or rather ignorant woman--ignorant of the advances of that civilization which the world had witnessed while she was growing old. At twelve she found herself alone, dressed in all the glory of the newest of her many suits of raiment--with strong shoes however, and a serviceable bonnet on her head, and a warm, rich shawl on her shoulders. Thus clad, she peered out into the tent, went to the ha-ha, and satisfied herself that at any rate the youngsters were amusing themselves, spoke a word to Mrs. Greenacre over the ditch, and <b>took</b> <b>one</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quintain. Three or four young farmers were turning the machine round and round and poking at the bag of flour in a manner not at all intended by the inventor of the game; but no mounted sportsmen were there. Miss Thorne looked at her watch. It was only fifteen minutes past twelve, and it was understood that Harry Greenacre was not to begin till the half-hour.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the general}} public was notably more cynical in its reaction, being unimpressed by what they {{perceived}} as the experts' incompetence, and the law's heavy-handedness.
