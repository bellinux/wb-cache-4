5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following the Custom of the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Blythe's {{defense team}} {{attacked}} {{differences between the}} testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that Nosek and Blythe shook hands or <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> offered hand to another on stage; however, at the court hearing, he testified {{that there was no}} prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior.|$|E

Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would win.|$|E

Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an {{attempt to create a}} lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him {{to use it to}} drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, 1974 {{author and}} {{journalist}} Arthur Koestler published {{a letter from}} reader Nigel Parker in The Sunday Times of a striking coincidence between a scene in Poe's novel and an actual event that happened decades later: In 1884, the yacht Mignonette sank, with four men cast adrift. After weeks without food, they decided <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> should be sacrificed as food for the other three, just as in Poe's novel. The loser was a young cabin boy named Richard Parker, coincidentally the same name as Poe's fictional character. Parker's shipmates, Tom Dudley and Edwin Stephens, were later tried for murder in a precedent-setting common law trial, the renowned R v Dudley and Stephens.|$|E

5|$|One bank {{employee}} {{testified that}} Shakur {{was one of}} the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge's order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur's rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible. In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, {{although}} it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was a son of Popol Hol. Ruler3 is depicted on the 8th-century AltarQ, but his name glyph has broken away. KuIx was the 4thruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on AltarQ.|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women to the point <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E

5|$|In 1021/22, however, Xiphias, now {{posted at}} Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II {{because he was}} not allowed to {{accompany}} the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had risen in revolt {{in the early years of}} Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> should take his place; who it would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming to sow distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics.|$|E
5|$|In late 1940, an {{engineer}} had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group {{wanted to bring}} to the Allied forces. It was decided <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to Stockholm. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in Östmark in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian legation was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British military attaché. He got in contact with Major Malcolm Munthe, who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison. On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war). He was originally scheduled to be deported to Canada via Moscow and China, but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in Öreryd. He was ordered by the British to escape from Öreryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the Swedish Home Guard close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.|$|E
5|$|Jason starts {{work with}} an NGO in Thailand, having left his wife and {{children}} in Canada and abandoned a lucrative job at his father-in-law's legal firm. He communicates with his wife Ali over Skype. Jason's first task is to find witnesses to or survivors from a human-trafficking incident and then to shut down the brothels into which they have been trafficked; his boss Marta sends him into the brothels as she cannot enter herself. His specific focus is an Asia-wide brothel ring's trafficking of girls into Bangkok for prostitution as part of the child sex tourism industry. An abandoned storage truck has been discovered containing the bodies of dead sex workers. Attempting to build a legal case against the brothel ring, Jason pays to see prostitutes in the hope <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> witnessed the incident. The first prostitute he sees is Number 18, whose attempts to seduce him make him uneasy. Thinking Number 18 could be a key witness, he tries to persuade her to testify. The other prostitutes Jason encounters are too afraid to give evidence. Number 18 answers some of Jason's questions about where she is from, where she has worked, and how long she has been working, but only on the condition that Jason pay 100 baht for each response. She reveals that she has been prostituted in Thailand and Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Mick {{encounters}} two vampires who {{are looking}} for Coraline. Once they leave, Mick visits his vampire friend Josef, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> was Lance (Jason Butler Harner), a rich and powerful vampire. Mick finds Coraline at a storage facility working on a compound for the vampire cure. Coraline explains that during the French Revolution there were seven siblings of royal blood who were vampires, two of whom were Lance and Coraline. She then uses the compound to cure Mick's vampirism, although Lance arrives and takes her away. Mick enjoys life as a human, although the cure is only temporary. Beth's boss at BuzzWire is killed, and a new assistant district attorney named Benjamin Talbot (Eric Winter) investigates the murder. Mick and Beth discuss the problems of having a romantic relationship, and although they end up kissing, Mick tells her he needs time to figure things out. Photos of Mick getting hit by a vehicle find their way into the hands of Talbot. Mick and Beth decide to start a romantic relationship, and go to a restaurant for their first date. When Beth quits her job at BuzzWire and becomes unemployed, Talbot offers her a job as a civilian investigator. Talbot receives a list of names of all the vampires in the area, including Mick, from an unknown source. Beth tells Mick that she cannot continue to date him because of their vampire-human situation, but Mick says that he loves her and they kiss.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E
