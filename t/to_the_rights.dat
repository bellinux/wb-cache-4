5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

A Clash of Kings was the first book of the Ice and Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999.

5|$|Following Louisa's {{persistent}} claims {{regarding the}} divinity of Henry Prince, her mother enlisted medical aid and had Louisa certified insane and then placed her in Moorcroft House Asylum, Hillingdon. Her treatment and forced incarceration in the asylum has remained of interest with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of psychiatric patients; Dr Arthur Stillwell, the presiding physician, made notes on Louisa's condition and treatment, recorded in The Lancet. Louisa {{escaped from the}} asylum in January 1848, travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone {{at a hotel in}} Cavendish Square, but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station. Cobbe alerted the Commissioners in Lunacy, whose report by Bryan Procter led to her release in May 1848. Louisa then sued her brother, cousin and brother-in-law, Frederick Ripley, for abduction and false imprisonment in Nottidge v. Ripley and Another (1849); the trial was reported daily in The Times newspaper. In 1860 Louisa's brother, Ralph Nottidge, sued Prince to recoup the money that Louisa had given him {{as a result of his}} undue influence over her, in the case of Nottidge v. Prince (1860). The Nottidges won the case, with costs. After the cases were resolved Louisa Nottidge returned to Spaxton and spent the rest of her life as one of the Agapemonites.|$|E
5|$|From Maryland's {{earliest}} days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists {{to leave}} religious rivalries behind. Along with giving {{instructions on the}} establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, {{so as not to}} disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of man, but did not specifically detail protections for religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.|$|E
5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of such mission.|$|E
