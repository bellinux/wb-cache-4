This paper presents a method by integrating the heating process with <b>thermal-induced</b> mechanical deformations of soft tissues for simulation {{and analysis of the}} thermal ablation process. This method combines bio-heat transfer theories, constitutive elastic material law under thermal loads as well as non-rigid motion dynamics to predict and analyze thermal-mechanical deformations of soft tissues. The 3 D governing equations of thermal-mechanical soft tissue deformation are discretized by using the finite difference scheme and are subsequently solved by numerical algorithms.

40|$|Abstract – The {{conventional}} {{tools for}} mismatch elimination such as geometric symmetry and common centroid technology can only eliminate systematic mismatch, but can {{do little to}} reduce random mismatch and <b>thermal-induced</b> mismatch. As the development of VLSI technology, the random mismatch {{is becoming more and}} more serious. And in the context of Silicon on Insulator (SOI), the self-heating effect leads to unbearable <b>thermal-induced</b> mismatch. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a new model which can estimate the combination effect of both random mismatch and <b>thermal-induced</b> mismatch by mismatch analysis and SPICE simulation. And in order to meet the different sensitivities of different symmetry pairs, an automatic classification tool and a configurable optimization process are also introduced. All of these are embedded in the floorplanning process. The final experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method. I...|$|E

Daily and seasonal temperature fluctuation causes expansion and contraction of pavement material, which then leads to the generation of thermal strain. In this study, field observation and laboratory tests were conducted to investigate seasonal variation of <b>thermal-induced</b> strain in flexible pavement. Field observations were conducted at the Integrated Road Research Facility (IRRF) ’s test road in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which is fully equipped with structural and environmental monitoring instruments. The main objective of the field study was to compare the variation of <b>thermal-induced</b> strain in warm and cold seasons. Field results indicated that <b>thermal-induced</b> strain is 1. 4 – 2. 0 times greater in cold seasons than in warm seasons following the same pavement {{temperature variation}}s; however, strain generation rate was greater in warm seasons. Laboratory testing of asphalt slab and cylindrical samples produced comparable ratios.

The effective dispersion and the suitable {{density of the}} silver nanoparticles in the composite microspheres are demonstrated by the <b>thermal-induced</b> SERS signal and its high reproducibility during thermocycling.

40|$|International audienceAcousto-elastic {{effect is}} an {{observation}} of material's nonlinear elastic properties, which {{are sensitive to}} early stage damages. In a study of acousto- elasticity, stress-induced velocity variation is a key parameter for the understanding of material's mechanical behaviors and a reliable estimation of acousto-elastic coefficient. In heterogeneous material as concrete, Coda Wave Interferometry (CWI) analysis can monitor the variation of the propagation velocity with a high precision (relative resolution of 10 ^- 3 %), which makes it adequate for studying the acousto-elastic effect in concrete. On the other hand, as propagation velocity is also affected by temperature, the <b>thermal-induced</b> velocity variation causes a non-negligible bias to the CWI result of stress-induced velocity variation. In this paper we present a bias control technique for CWI analysis designed for the compensation of: 1) the <b>thermal-induced</b> velocity change due to environmental temperature fluctuation and 2) experimental bias resulting from entire procedures of measurement and signal processing.

40|$|Micro {{residual}} stresses {{of the second}} and third order {{play an important role in}} the fracture mechanical analysis of thermally-cycled materials, and thus in lifetime analysis of such effected components. For example, forming rollers in a rolling plant made of white cast iron can develop cracking due to stress risers caused by <b>thermal-induced</b> {{residual stresses}}. After long-term service exposure of the low-alloy, heat-resistant ferritic steels damage was observed during operation, caused by the precipitation of copper particles ranging from 1 to 3 nm in size which are surrounded by coherent residual microstresses of third order. In multi-phase materials can exist two kind of micro residual stresses: <b>thermal-induced</b> residual stresses of the second order and coherent residual stresses of third order. In multi-phase materials, <b>thermal-induced</b> stresses of the second order appear when individual material phases exhibit different thermal expansion coefficients. Such differences in temperature-related expansion coefficients of cementite and ferrite in steel and white cast iron promote the development of these types of residual stresses. These differences below the Curie point of cementite grow with decreasing temperature and therefore, the largest variations of the residual stresses can be assumed at ambient temperatures. In multi-phase materials, coherent residual stresses of the third order appear when the lattice parameter of the second phase particles embedded coherently in the matrix and the lattice parameter of the matrix are different. Such differences in the ferritic Cu containing materials between the lattice parameters of coherent Cu particles and the lattice parameters of the matrix yield to distortion of the lattice around the Cu particles that causes the coherent residual stresses of third order. The main objective of the here discussed research was to develop a micro-magnetic non-destructive method for quantitative characterisation and separation of microscopic residual stresses of second and third order in multi-phase, iron-based material...|$|E

In order to shed light on these interactions, atomistic simulation by Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been shown to be an invaluable tool. It suffers, however, from severe time-scale limitations. In this work we employ the recently developed Collective Variable-Driven Hyperdynamics (CVHD) method to hydrogen etching of graphite for varying inter-impact times up to a realistic value of 1 ms, which corresponds to a flux of ~ 1020 m- 2 s- 1. The results show that the erosion yield, hydrogen surface coverage and species distribution are significantly affected by the time between impacts. This can be explained by the higher probability for C-C bond breaking due to the prolonged exposure to thermal stress and the subsequent transition from ion- to <b>thermal-induced</b> etching. This latter regime of <b>thermal-induced</b> etching - chemical erosion - is here accessed for the first time using atomistic simulations. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that accounting for long time-scales significantly affects ion bombardment simulations and should not be neglected in a wide range of conditions, in contrast to what is typically assumed...|$|E

Inlet temperatures varied from 373  K to 663  K, with heat flux ranging from 300  kW/m 2 to 550  kW/m 2. Comparative analyses between predicted and experimental results were {{used to evaluate the}} ability of turbulence models to respond to variable thermophysical properties of hydrocarbon fuel at supercritical pressure. It was found that the prediction performance of turbulence models is mainly determined by the damping function, which enables them to respond differently to local flow conditions. Although prediction accuracy for experimental results varied from condition to condition, the shear stress transport (SST) and launder and sharma models performed better than all other models used in the study. For very small buoyancy-influenced runs, the <b>thermal-induced</b> acceleration due to variations in density lead to the impairment of heat transfer occurring in the vicinity of pseudo-critical points, and heat transfer was enhanced at higher temperatures through the combined action of four thermophysical properties: density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat.

30|$|The {{increased}} {{complexity and}} operating frequency in current single chip microprocessors is {{resulting in a}} decrease in the performance improvements. Consequently, major manufacturers offer chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures in order {{to keep up with the}} expected performance gains. This architecture is successfully being introduced in many markets including that of the embedded systems. Nevertheless, the integration of several cores onto the same chip may lead to increased heat dissipation and consequently additional costs for cooling, higher power consumption, decrease of the reliability, and <b>thermal-induced</b> performance loss, among others. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of the thermal issues for the future chip multiprocessor architectures and show that as the number of on-chip cores increases, the <b>thermal-induced</b> problems will worsen. In addition, we present several scenarios that result in excessive thermal stress to the CMP chip or significant performance loss. In order to minimize or even eliminate these problems, we propose thermal-aware scheduler (TAS) algorithms. When assigning processes to cores, TAS takes their temperature and cooling ability into account in order to avoid thermal stress and at the same time improve the performance. Experimental results have shown that a TAS algorithm that considers also the temperatures of neighboring cores is able to significantly reduce the temperature-induced performance loss while at the same time, decrease the chip's temperature across many different operation and configuration scenarios.|$|E
40|$|Insoluble {{aggregation}} or precipitation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common degradation pathways observed for biotherapeutics; despite this, the structural mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood due to difficulties associated with biophysical characterisation of protein particulates. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a solid-state circular dichroism (CD) technique, which allows in situ measurements of the secondary and tertiary structural changes associated with the formation of visible therapeutic protein aggregates. We demonstrate how solid-state CD, in conjunction with other biophysical and computational methods can aid in gaining valuable insights into the mechanisms and pathways of <b>thermal-induced</b> precipitation of Bacillus anthracis recombinant protective antigen (rPA), the primary immunogen of anthrax subunit vaccine. Using these methods, we show the domains d 3 and d 4 are the most labile of the four structurally distinct domains of rPA and play the critical role in nucleating the cascade of unfolding and aggregation. During the assembly process, the domains d 1 and d 2 become kinetically trapped within the insoluble aggregate and reveal previously intractable distinct tertiary structural elements of the rPA native structure. These findings reveal a uniquely detailed insight into the role of rPA domains on protein stability and provide a mechanistic framework for <b>thermal-induced</b> unfolding and precipitation. It also shows that solid-state CD provides a novel approach in characterising protein precipitation that may facilitate rational improvements to the stability of biopharmaceuticals...|$|E
