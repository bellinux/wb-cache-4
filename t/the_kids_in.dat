5|$|All major {{characters}} in the miniseries were played by the five members of <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall, except for the mayor's son, who was played by young actor Landon Reynolds-Trudel. Several of the original <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall characters appear in cameo roles, including Mark McKinney's Chicken Lady as a candidate juror and Paul Bellini clad only in his towel at an ATM; in addition, McCulloch and McKinney's police officers are tweaked variations of their OPP officer characters of the original series.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{proposed}} by Bruce McCulloch during a 2008 <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall comedy tour and {{developed by the}} ensemble into a dark-comedy murder mystery, a departure from their typical sketch comedy format. Inspiration for the series came {{in part from the}} British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. While the members of <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall play all of the major adult characters, a number of other comedic actors appear in supporting roles, including Dan Redican, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Robson, Susan Kent and Mike Beaver. The series was filmed in North Bay, Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario in the summer of 2009.|$|E
5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E

5|$|After working {{odd jobs}} in {{the first months of}} the Great Depression, Hanna joined the Harman and Ising {{animation}} studio in 1930. During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as Captain and <b>the</b> <b>Kids.</b> <b>In</b> 1937, while working at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hanna met Joseph Barbera. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry and live action/animated hybrid films. In 1957, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as The Flintstones, The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn was merged with Time Warner in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.|$|E
5|$|During {{a reunion}} tour in summer 2008, <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall comedy troupe decided {{they would like}} to work {{together}} again. Since their 1996 movie Brain Candy, during which they had a falling out over creative differences, they had only worked together on live comedy tours and had not appeared on television together since the end of their show in 1995. Bruce McCulloch pitched a television story idea which {{the rest of the group}} liked. They spent a couple days together brainstorming and developing characters. The storyline resolved into a murder mystery miniseries – partly inspired by the British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. McCulloch described it as Corner Gas meets Twin Peaks. The format diverged from their typical sketch comedy style by following a continuous narrative – though side-stories explore characters further. Along with producer Susan Cavin in fall 2008, they pitched the concept to CBC executive Fred Fuchs who greenlit the project.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E

25|$|Two of the film's {{characters}} created minor {{waves in}} the media before its release. The first was Don Roritor, which many took to be a jab at producer Lorne Michaels. Michaels is famous for creating Saturday Night Live, and was responsible for bringing <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall to television. He is also known for a demeanor that some interpret as detached, and Mark McKinney mirrors his speech patterns almost exactly as the cold-hearted Roritor. However, Michaels produced the film, so he was fully aware of how he was depicted.|$|E

They were an influence for later Canadian comedians, such as Lorne Michaels (Shuster's son-in-law), the Royal Canadian Air Farce and <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall. In the late 1980s, many of their comedy skits were repackaged in half-hour chunks and syndicated around the world under the title Wayne & Shuster; the comedians filmed new introductions for the series.|$|E

25|$|The VADRS was {{developed}} by Wolraich with the aim to add common comorbid conditions associated with ADHD that was lacking from previous assessments. As public awareness of ADHD has increased, epidemiological studies have found a prevalence rate of 4-12% in children of ages 6–12 throughout the United States. Not only is ADHD the most commonly encountered childhood-onset disorder in neurodevelopment, {{there is also a}} high comorbidity rate linking ADHD with other behavioral, emotional and learning problems and disabilities. As a need to obtain a defined population sample {{due to a lack of}} funds, Wolraich invented the teacher VADRS. The teacher rating scales allowed Wolraich to have all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>in</b> one class be sampled by one teacher and to increase communication between physicians and teachers.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy {{for about a year}} in the Toronto Second City Training Centre, where he began taking improv classes and met Kevin McDonald, who gave him a job as an usher at a local art house movie theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the miniseries Anne of Avonlea. Foley, McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson formed <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall, which debuted on television from 1988 to 1995. Foley played some characters, including Hecubus, one of the Sizzler sisters, the A. T. & Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with , he left the troupe {{in the middle of the}} writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the NewsRadio cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe to get paid for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlit, Foley did the film because he was contractually obligated. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer. Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in <b>the</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall 2010 reunion project Death Comes to Town. Paul Simms, creator of NewsRadio, happened to be a huge fan of Foley's work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom Green Acres.|$|E
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>in</b> the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
