5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All <b>Things</b> <b>Considered</b> on NPR to discuss the site around that time.

5|$|In 1991 Abu-Jamal {{published}} {{an essay in}} the Yale Law Journal, {{on the death penalty}} and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by National Public Radio's All <b>Things</b> <b>Considered</b> program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and US Senator Bob Dole (Kansas Republican Party). Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of Live from Death Row.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd Georgeâ€™s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All <b>things</b> <b>considered,</b> it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
