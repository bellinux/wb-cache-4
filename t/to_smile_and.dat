500|$|A {{second round}} of Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} were also taking place on January 21, and by then, Baird was politically isolated, with no major groups coming to her defense. [...] A growing number of senators came out in opposition to Baird during the day, including two Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and influential centrist Democrats John Breaux of Louisiana and David Boren of Oklahoma. [...] Baird gamely continued <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> testify well into the evening, but as Stephanopoulos later wrote, [...] "She didn't know it yet, but she was toast." [...] Biden called Clinton and told him the nomination was lost.|$|E

500|$|Miranda Seymour in The New York Times {{remarks on}} the [...] "breathless passion" [...] of the narrator's voice as being {{absolutely}} convincing, citing as an example Nancy's statement to her sister {{at the start of}} the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E
500|$|Max Bemis {{was raised}} [...] "in a strong Jewish environment." [...] Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain {{elements}} of Jewish humor. [...] While most of band's earlier songs {{are free of}} any such inspiration, the songs of ...Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage. [...] "Alive with the Glory of Love," [...] Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust, based on Bemis's grandparents, [...] while [...] "Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too" [...] includes mentions of [...] "the old shul" [...] and a rabbi's teachings. [...] A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of [...] "Died a Jew". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of [...] "the murder of God" [...] and Bemis' departures from kosher. [...] References to religion come again in [...] "Fed to Death" [...] on Say Anything, referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> clear your name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in shame.' ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill {{grew up in}} Fullerton, California. She is {{the fifth}} of seven children; {{her mother was a}} dental {{hygienist}} and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls [...] "had <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> do cutesy little routines on the floor". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling [...] "resistant to rules", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: [...] "My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls—the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E
500|$|Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and {{misogyny}} through Kilgrave's {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Smile", calling the season [...] "the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique" [...] from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones <b>to</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> her obliging, to [...] "similar well-meaning scenarios [...] play out {{in the real world}} time and again each day" [...] many in the form of gendered street harassment, that resonates with many women. Hill also added that [...] "Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent," [...] due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that [...] "Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise." [...] Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that [...] "powerlessness is not gendered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three days later, 14 February, Soubirous {{returned}} to the Grotto. She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: [...] "The second time was the following Sunday. ... Then I started to throw holy water in her direction, {{and at the same}} time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go. She started <b>to</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> bowed ... This was the second time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 2013, {{the probe}} was pointed towards Earth to capture {{an image of}} the Earth and the Moon, as part of a natural light, multi-image {{portrait}} of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as {{it was the first time}} NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance. The imaging team said they wanted people <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> wave to the skies, with Cassini scientist, Carolyn Porco, describing the moment as a chance to [...] "celebrate life on the Pale Blue Dot".|$|E
2500|$|While {{being led}} to his execution, Guiteau {{was said to have}} {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> wave at spectators and reporters, happy to {{be at the center of}} attention to the very end. He notoriously danced his way to the gallows and shook hands with his executioner. On the scaffold, as a last request, he recited a poem called [...] "I am Going to the Lordy", which he had written during his incarceration. He had originally requested an orchestra to play as he sang his poem, but this request was denied.|$|E
2500|$|Burr is a {{lead role}} in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton, which was written by playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and {{inspired}} by historian Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of Hamilton. The role of Burr was originated by Leslie Odom, Jr., who won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical {{for his work in}} the role. In Hamilton, Burr is both the main narrator of events as well as a sympathetic yet growing antagonist to Hamilton. He is portrayed as ambitious but indecisive, liking <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> gladhand rather than make any strong commitment or action—something Hamilton constantly questions and calls him out on. Burr's prominent songs include [...] "Wait For It", which explains his willingness to wait for fate to decide his place and what he deserves, and [...] "The Room Where It Happens", which demonstrates his desire for more influence in decision making when he realizes waiting is not getting him where he wants to be. This puts him increasingly at odds with Hamilton, who views Burr as lacking morals or ideals and being willing to change positions for small gain. During the final duel, Burr is shown to have regret and sorrow for the duel and his role in Hamilton's death and his eventual villainous slant in history, rather than the more callous and dismissive regards records tend to show.|$|E
