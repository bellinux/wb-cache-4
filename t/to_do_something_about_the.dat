5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absence {{of peace and}} security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
25|$|To {{conservative}} elements this protest {{seemed to}} flout {{the law and}} as a result the government found itself under increasing pressure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. Private groups of concerned citizens began to form also, many of them formed from returned servicemen, from organisations such as the Returned Soldiers and Citizens Political Federation and the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). As the tension mounted, another demonstration was planned for March.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli, king Henry of Cyprus sent the senechal Jean de Grailly to Europe to warn European monarchs about the {{critical}} situation in the Levant. Jean met with Pope Nicholas IV who shared his worries and {{wrote a letter to}} European potentates <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. Most however were too preoccupied by the Sicilian question to organize a Crusade, as was king Edward I too entangled in troubles at home.|$|E

500|$|Despite this, {{the growing}} numbers of {{settlers}} (very quickly outnumbering Yavapai) began to call for the government <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people occupying the land {{that they wanted to}} occupy and exploit themselves. The editor of a local newspaper, the Arizona Miner, said [...] "Extermination is our only hope, and the sooner it is accomplished the better." ...|$|E
500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at the moment I have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should be the one who, in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E
500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take all the blood they want from me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find out what I am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Geldof {{responded to}} a BBC news report from Michael Buerk about the famine in Ethiopia by mobilising the pop world <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> images he had seen.

2500|$|On November 18, Nkunda ordered rebel {{troops to}} pull back [...] {{from the town of}} Kabasha, citing the need to avoid clashes, get {{humanitarian}} aid to the region and create [...] "separation zones" [...] between the government and rebel forces, which would be patrolled by UN peacekeepers; this was amongst the sacking of General Dieudonne Kayembe, armed forces chief of the Congolese army, after a chain of defeats. His replacement was cited as a bid to bolster military strength. According to MONUC commanders the town had been captured on Sunday, though they could not confirm whether withdrawal had begun. Meanwhile, the French Foreign Ministry circulated a draft asking the UN to reinforce the MONUC garrison in the Congo by 3,000. This move was stated as a possible measure of stability, but not one of peace. UN spokesman Alan Doss said that [...] "Reinforcements are not going to resolve all the problems... Reinforcements will allow us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation, which has deteriorated fast, help us to stabilize the situation a bit, and allow the political and diplomatic process to go forward." [...] While the United Nations Security Council voted on Wednesday, Doss acknowledged that it could take months to get reinforcements in, but wanted to speed the process. Doss also stated that he believed the humanitarian effort was improving.|$|E

2500|$|He {{is listed}} as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, {{dedicated}} to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar. At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass... But they make great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E
