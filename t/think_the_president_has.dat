2500|$|Finnish parliamentarian Kimmo Kiljunen, {{the deputy}} {{president}} of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly {{and a member of}} its election monitoring mission in Russia, questioned the accuracy of the reported Chechen election results in an interview to a Russian radio station, saying that it is [...] "impossible that all voters come and vote for one and the same party." [...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base. And it is a very problematic situation that the president will be a candidate for one party, and will not {{be a member of the}} council, as well as governors of various regions who were candidates of one party - and will not be members of the Duma. This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> the right to be a candidate, the governor has the right to be a candidate - I'm not criticizing it, I just ask - how is this possible?" ...|$|E
5000|$|One of Gates's lawyers, Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr, {{a former}} {{professor}} of Obama, stated that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> taken {{the right approach}} by {{trying to make sure}} we move forward ... He's always had the ability to negotiate difficult conversations, and his steps today are an important step in the right direction. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> given his assessment, which makes a lot of sense, and, however you feel about it, it has reduced the temperature and allowed everyone to move forward in a constructive way." [...] Ogletree has since written a book about the case. Steve Killion, president of the Cambridge patrol officers association, also stated [...] "I'm absolutely pleased with call. I {{think it was a good}} thing for the president to do. .... We all want to see this behind us." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{chairman}} of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (which is tasked with investigating [...] "waste, fraud, and abuse" [...] in the executive branch), Chaffetz {{has been criticized for}} showing a disinterest in investigating President Trump's conflicts of interest and for failing to criticize him for not resolving ethical questions. Chaffetz has said that Trump's global financial ties don’t merit a congressional investigation: [...] "It’s interesting, because under Section 208 of the criminal code, the president is exempt from almost every conflict-of-interest law... I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> a duty and an obligation {{to live up to the}} Constitution and the law. And what he’s required to do by law, it appears he’s done." [...] However, ethics experts have said that Trump's business conflicts and his failure to resolve them are [...] "nakedly unconstitutional." [...] Chaffetz also declined to investigate the circumstances surrounding the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who stepped down amid controversy over his communications with the Russian government before Trump took office. Chaffetz said that [...] "it's taking care of itself" [...] and that any investigation into Flynn was for the House Intelligence Committee to conduct; Chaffetz also asked the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the leaks that brought Flynn's contracts with Russian officials to public light.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of his assertions in his book, McClellan was invited to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.

5000|$|According to a 2006 {{newspaper}} {{column by}} Jack Betts, [...] "When eight Nazis bent on mayhem came ashore on Long Island in 1942, they were soon caught {{and ordered to}} stand trial in a secret military tribunal. President Roosevelt appointed Royall to defend them, but <b>the</b> <b>president</b> didn't want any foolishness. He wanted the Nazis executed, the sooner the better. Royall's orders were {{to stay away from}} civilian courts. Royall wrote Roosevelt that he didn't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> authority to convene a secret court to try his clients, and asked <b>the</b> <b>president</b> to change his order. Roosevelt refused—whereupon Royall appealed to the U.S. District Court, arguing the secret tribunal was unconstitutional.|$|R

[...] Graham continues to say, [...] "Now it's obvious that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> renounced <b>the</b> prophet Mohammed, and he has renounced Islam, and he has accepted Jesus Christ.
