25|$|Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle {{argued that there}} are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not exist.|$|E
25|$|Fraenkel et al. (1973, pp.303304) {{explain why}} Skolem's result was so {{surprising}} to set theorists in the 1920s. Gödel's completeness theorem and the compactness theorem were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated {{the way that}} first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although Gödel's original proof of the completeness theorem was complicated. Leon Henkin's alternative proof of the completeness theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first-order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using higher-order logic with full semantics <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have any countable models, due to the semantics being used.|$|E
500|$|Hendrick Vroom explains, [...] "the term Maya [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} as 'illusion,' but <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' {{does not mean}} that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. Maya means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned." [...] According to Wendy Doniger, [...] "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{explain the}} {{threshold}} effect, Einstein {{argued that it}} takes a certain amount of energy, called the work function and denoted by , to remove an electron from the metal. This amount of energy is different for each metal. If the energy of the photon is less than the work function, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not carry sufficient energy to remove the electron from the metal.

2500|$|For example, if a {{force of}} 10 newtons ( [...] = 10 N) acts along a point that travels 2 meters ( [...] = 2 m), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> the work [...] = (10 N)(2 m) = 20 N m = 20 J.

[...] Then, provided that {{there are at least}} as many alternatives as individuals, an aggregation rule satisfying Arrow's other conditions is collegial. This means that there are individuals who belong to the intersection ("collegium") of all decisive coalitions. If there is someone who has a veto, then he belongs to the collegium. If the rule is assumed to be neutral, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> have someone who has a veto.|$|E

2500|$|In matrix mechanics, the {{mathematical}} formulation of quantum mechanics, any pair of non-commuting self-adjoint operators representing observables {{are subject to}} similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents {{the state of the}} wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable [...] is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate [...] of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable [...] need not be an eigenstate of another observable : If so, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.|$|E
2500|$|With indexed color images, {{the palette}} always stores {{trichromatic}} colors {{at a depth}} of 8 bits per channel (24 bits per palette entry). Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries are assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not need palette entries for all 256 colors).

She stated that [...] "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which {{have nothing to do with}} the facts we have to consider to-day. Even <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse." [...] In New York, Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise told the press after seeing The Birth of a Nation that the film was [...] "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". In Boston, the civil rights activist William Monroe Trotter organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations, while Booker T. Washington wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film. In Washington D.C, the Reverend Francis James Grimké published a pamphlet entitled [...] "Fighting a Vicious Film" [...] that challenged the historical accuracy of The Birth of a Nation on a scene-by-scene basis.|$|E
