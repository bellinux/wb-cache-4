The Republic of <b>Tatarstan</b> passed a law in 1999, which came into force in 2001, establishing an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in <b>Tatarstan</b> since. Unofficially, other scripts are used as well, mostly Latin and Arabic. All official sources in <b>Tatarstan</b> must use Cyrillic on their websites and in publishing. In other cases, where Tatar has no official status, the use of a specific alphabet depends on the preference of the author.|$|E

25|$|The 1921–1922 {{famine in}} <b>Tatarstan</b> {{was a period}} of mass {{starvation}} and drought {{that took place in the}} Tatar ASSR as a result of war communism policy, in which 500,000 to 2,000,000 peasants died. The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921–22 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. According to Roman Serbyn, a professor of Russian and East European history, the <b>Tatarstan</b> famine was the first man-made famine in the Soviet Union and systematically targeted ethnic minorities such as Volga Tatars and Volga Germans. The 1921–1922 famine in <b>Tatarstan</b> has been compared to Holodomor in Ukraine, and in 2008, the All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921-22 <b>Tatarstan</b> famine as genocide of Muslim Tatars.|$|E

25|$|Tatar and Udmurt Jews {{are special}} {{territorial}} {{groups of the}} Ashkenazi Jews, which started to be formed in the residence areas of mixed Turkic-speaking (Tatars, Kryashens, Bashkirs, Chuvash people), Finno-Ugric-speaking (Udmurts, Mari people) and Slavic-speaking (Russians) population. The Ashkenazi Jews on the territory of <b>Tatarstan</b> {{first appeared in the}} 1830s. The Jews of Udmurtia and <b>Tatarstan</b> subdivided on cultural and linguistic characteristics into two territorial groups: 1) Udmurt Jews (Udmurt Jewry), who lived on the territory of Udmurtia and the north of Tatarstan; 2) Tatar Jews or Kazan Jews (Tatar Jewry or Kazan Jewry), who lived mainly in the city of Kazan and its agglomeration.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the Russian Republic of <b>Tatarstan</b> {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} Turkic Tatar language to Latin script {{in order to bring}} it into the modern world of the Internet. There was opposition from both inside and outside <b>Tatarstan,</b> with Tatars arguing it would threaten their national identity and to sever their ties to the past. The Russian State Duma rejected the proposal. President Vladimir Putin said that a Tatar move from Cyrillic to Latin would 'threaten the unity of the Russian Federation'. In 2002, Putin therefore enacted a law that made the use of Cyrillic mandatory for all languages in all autonomous republics of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Outside of <b>Tatarstan,</b> urban Tatars usually speak Russian {{as their}} first {{language}} (in cities such as Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Tashkent, Almaty, and cities of the Ural and western Siberia) and other languages in a worldwide diaspora.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of <b>Tatarstan</b> {{passed a}} law in 1999 that came into force in 2001 {{establishing}} an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in <b>Tatarstan</b> since. In 2004, an attempt to introduce a Latin-based alphabet for Tatar was further abandoned when the Constitutional Court ruled that the federal law of the 15th of November 2002 mandating the use of Cyrillic for the state languages of the republics of the Russian Federation does not contradict the Russian constitution. In accordance with this Constitutional Court ruling, on 28 December 2004, the Tatar Supreme Court overturned the Tatarstani law that made the Latin alphabet official.|$|E
25|$|The region's {{main source}} of wealth is oil. <b>Tatarstan</b> {{produces}} 32 million tonnes of crude oil per year and has estimated oil reserves of more than 1 billion tons. Industrial production constitutes 45% of the Republic's gross regional domestic product. The most developed manufacturing industries are petrochemical industry and machine building. The truck-maker KamAZ is the region's largest enterprise and employs about one fifth of Tatarstan's work force. Kazanorgsintez, based in Kazan, is one of Russia's largest chemical companies. Tatarstan's aviation industry produces Tu-214 passenger airplanes and helicopters. The Kazan Helicopter Plant {{is one of the}} largest helicopter manufacturers in the world. Engineering, textiles, clothing, wood processing, and food industries are also of key significance in <b>Tatarstan.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1939, in <b>Tatarstan</b> (a {{republic}} of Russia where Tatar is most commonly used) {{and all other}} parts of the Soviet Union a Cyrillic script was developed and is still used to write Tatar. It is also used in Kazakhstan.|$|E
25|$|Kazan, {{the capital}} of <b>Tatarstan,</b> shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has {{registered}} a brand The Third Capital of Russia, though {{a number of other}} major cities compete for this status, including Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tatarstan</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} developed regions of Russia. The republic is highly industrialized, and ranks second to Samara Oblast in terms of industrial production per km2. Tatarstan's GDP per capita was $12,000 in 2014, with GDP in 2014 at about $44 billion.|$|E
25|$|Despite a rocky start, Kazan Metro was triumphantly {{opened on}} August 27, 2005 by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, President of <b>Tatarstan</b> Mintimer Shaymiyev, and the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, {{as well as}} the mayor of Kazan and the heads of all {{existing}} Russian Metros.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 census, 69% of Russian Tatars {{who responded}} to the {{question}} about language ability claimed a knowledge of the Tatar language. In <b>Tatarstan,</b> 93% of Tatars and 3,6% of Russians did so. In neighbouring Bashkortostan, 67% of Tatars, 27% of Bashkirs, and 1,3% of Russians did.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as <b>Tatarstan,</b> Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of 1920s and in 1930s, state repressions, {{suppression}} and atheist propaganda against all religions increased. E.g. in 1930, out of the 12,000 mosques in <b>Tatarstan,</b> more than 10,000 were closed, from 90 to 97% mullahs and muezzins were deprived of the right to exercize their profession.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century <b>Tatarstan</b> {{became a}} center of Jadidism, an Islamic {{movement}} that preached tolerance of other religions. Under the influence of local Jadidist theologians, the Bulgars were renowned for their friendly relations with other peoples of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution religion was largely outlawed and all theologians were repressed.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{there are}} six {{independent}} Turkic countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan; There are also several Turkic national subdivisions in the Russian Federation including Bashkortostan, <b>Tatarstan,</b> Chuvashia, Khakassia, Tuva, Yakutia, the Altai Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to Russian).|$|E
25|$|The first {{geological}} survey began in 1984, and by 1989 {{the construction of}} the first stage was drawn up and submitted for final authorisation to begin construction. It was not to be. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up and the economic, as well as political turmoil that rocked <b>Tatarstan</b> and Russia, caused the Kazan Metro project to be axed.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known organized state {{within the}} boundaries of <b>Tatarstan</b> was Volga Bulgaria (c.700–1238). The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus and the Cuman-Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionaries from Baghdad around the time of ibn Fadlan's journey in 922.|$|E
25|$|The {{republic}} has {{a highly}} developed transport network. It mainly comprises highways, railway lines, four navigable rivers— Volga (İdel), Kama (Çulman), Vyatka (Noqrat) and Belaya (Ağidel), and oil pipelines and airlines. The territory of <b>Tatarstan</b> is crossed {{by the main}} gas pipelines carrying natural gas from Urengoy and Yamburg {{to the west and}} the major oil pipelines supplying oil to various cities in the European part of Russia.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an urgent}} need for a law to clearly define the powers of each federal subject. Such a law was passed on 31 March 1992, when Yeltsin and Ruslan Khasbulatov, then {{chairman}} of the Russian Supreme Soviet and an ethnic Chechen himself, signed the Federation Treaty bilaterally with 86 out of 88 federal subjects. In almost all cases, demands for greater autonomy or independence were satisfied by concessions of regional autonomy and tax privileges. The treaty outlined three basic types of federal subjects and the powers that were reserved for local and federal government. The only federal subjects that did not sign the treaty were Chechnya and <b>Tatarstan.</b> Eventually, {{in the spring of}} 1994, President Yeltsin signed a special political accord with Mintimer Shaeymiev, the president of <b>Tatarstan,</b> granting many of its demands for greater autonomy for the republic within Russia; thus, Chechnya remained the only federal subject that did not sign the treaty. Neither Yeltsin nor the Chechen government attempted any serious negotiations and the situation deteriorated into a full-scale conflict.|$|E
25|$|Northern <b>Tatarstan</b> and Bashkortostan were {{in ancient}} times areas of {{settlement}} of the Udmurt people. Many Udmurt villages are divided in these two republics. Over the centuries Udmurts there were subjected to enforced Islamisation by the dominating Tatars and Bashkirs, but they preserved strong national consciousness and Pagan faith. In recent times pan-Udmurt worship services have taken place annually in Bashkortostan, {{and they have been}} subject of repression by Muslim authorities.|$|E
25|$|In the 1910s the Volga Tatars {{numbered}} {{about half}} a million in the Kazan Governorate in <b>Tatarstan,</b> their historical homeland, about 400,000 {{in each of the}} governments of Ufa, 100,000 in Samara and Simbirsk, and about 30,000 in Vyatka, Saratov, Tambov, Penza, Nizhny Novgorod, Perm and Orenburg. An additional 15,000 had migrated to Ryazan or were settled as prisoners in the 16th and 17th centuries in Lithuania (Vilnius, Grodno and Podolia). An additional 2000 resided in St. Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|Tatar: The Tatar {{alphabet}} in Russia {{is officially}} Cyrillic {{due to the}} requirements of Russian federal law. Several Romanization schemes exist, which are used on the Internet and some printed publication. Most of them are modelled in different ways on Turkish and employ dotted and dotless I, while some also use I with acute (Í), although for different phonemes. The only Latin alphabet that ever had official status in <b>Tatarstan,</b> Yañalif, used the character Ь instead of dotless i.|$|E
25|$|Russia holds {{oil sands}} in two main regions. Large {{resources}} {{are present in}} the Tunguska Basin, East Siberia, with the largest deposits being Olenek and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals basins (in and around <b>Tatarstan),</b> which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow permian formation. In Kazakhstan, large bitumen deposits are located in the North Caspian Basin.|$|E
