5|$|Temporary {{brachytherapy}} involves {{placement of}} radiation sources {{for a set}} duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the <b>type,</b> <b>size</b> and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do was}} to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's <b>type,</b> <b>size,</b> speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E

In the voluntary market, a variety of industry standards exist. These include the Voluntary Carbon Standard and the CDM Gold Standard that are implemented to provide third-party verification of carbon offset projects.

500|$|Many mammals {{communicate}} by vocalizing. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals {{to ward off}} other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in {{different regions of the}} ocean. Social vocalizations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the <b>type,</b> <b>size,</b> and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are infrasonic, below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to [...] away at still times near sunrise and sunset.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{dissertation}} won a prize, Columbia University Press, Princeton University Press, Oklahoma University Press, {{as well as}} Yad Vashem all {{declined to}} publish it. It was eventually published by a small publishing company, Quadrangle Books. This first edition was published in an unusually small type. Much of the page count increase of later versions is due to being published in a conventional <b>type</b> <b>size.</b> This was {{not the end of}} Hilberg's publishing woes. It was not translated until 1982, when Ulf Wolter of the small leftist publishers Olle & Wolter in Berlin published a German translation.

2500|$|When Western {{scholars}} {{explored the}} history of Islamic carpetmaking, several types of carpet pattern became conventionally called after the names of European painters who had used them, and these terms remain in use. [...] The classification is mostly that of Kurt Erdmann, once Director of the Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin), and the leading carpet scholar of his day. [...] Some of these types ceased to be produced several centuries ago, {{and the location of}} their production remains uncertain, so obvious alternative terms were not available. [...] The classification ignores the border patterns, and distinguishes between the <b>type,</b> <b>size</b> and arrangement of gul, or larger motifs in the central field of the carpet. [...] In addition to four types of Holbein carpets, there are Bellini carpets, Crivellis, Memlings, and Lotto carpets. [...] These names are somewhat random: many artists painted these types, and single artists often painted many types of carpets.|$|E

2500|$|Many animals {{communicate}} through vocalization. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including mating rituals, warning calls, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. In {{a number of}} species, males perform calls during mating rituals {{as a form of}} competition against other males and to signal females. Examples include hammer-headed bats, red deer, humpback whales, elephant seals, and songbirds. Other instances of vocal communication include the alarm calls of the Campbell monkey, the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of its four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary appropriately according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the [...] "eagle" [...] alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground.
