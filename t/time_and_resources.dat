The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E

40|$|Predictors {{of change}} in the number of sexual topics parents {{discussed}} and responsiveness during sex communication with their preadolescent after participating in a five-session sexual risk reduction intervention for parents were examined. Data were from 339 African American parents of preadolescents enrolled in the intervention arm of a randomized-controlled trial of the Parents’ Matter! Program (PMP). Four categories of predictors of success were examined: <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> constraints, personal characteristics, the parent-child relationship, and parent perceptions of child readiness for sex communication. There were only sporadic associations between success <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> constraints for either outcome. Parent perception of child readiness for sex communication was positively associated with discussions of sex topics (b = 1. 11, confidence interval [CI]: 0. 24 - 1. 97) and parental responsiveness (b =. 68, CI: 0. 22 - 1. 15).

40|$|Design space {{exploration}} during high level synthesis is often conducted through ad-hoc probing {{of the solution}} space using some scheduling algorithm. This is not only time consuming but also very dependent on designer’s experience. We propose a novel design exploration method that exploits the duality between the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> constrained scheduling problems. Our exploration automatically constructs a high quality time/area tradeoff curve in a fast, effective manner. It uses the MAX-MIN ant colony optimization to solve both the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> constrained scheduling problems. We switch between the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> constrained algorithms to quickly traverse the design space. Compared to using force directed scheduling exhaustively at every time step, our algorithm provides a significant solution quality savings (average 17. 3 % reduction of resource counts) with similar run time on a comprehensive benchmark suite constructed with classic and reallife samples. Our algorithms scale well over different applications and problem sizes...|$|R
5|$|The British had {{numerous}} issues {{in dealing with}} the expanding crisis. A defensive battle had been proven unsound by the immense amount of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> expended pursuing a similar course during the twelve year Malayan Emergency that had ended only a few years before, as well as Dutch efforts to quell the Indonesian rebels during the Indonesian War of Independence, but launching an offensive into Indonesian territory to take the initiative would bring the conflict into an all-out war, and this was unacceptable to Cabinet policy-makers. At the same time, an effective solution had to be found that did not cede Malaysia to the Communists, a move that many feared would be the beginning of the 'domino effect' in Asia. The proposal selected as the most effective was presented to the Cabinet in January 1964 by Richard Austen Butler, who recommended that Britain continue fighting without declaring war, with the conflict contained in Borneo, a strategy designed to weary the Indonesians of battle until the necessity of economic reform overcame them and peace was made.|$|E
5|$|Honduras was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to Honduras desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest {{was based on the}} distribution of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up until the middle of the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established in Honduras were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. In Honduras, the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by mining activities. This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels in Honduras, with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to invest <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas in Honduras.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{appreciated}} that constant patrols by destroyers was both wasteful of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> of those ships, {{and left them}} open to attack. Instead, they designed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships approaching and freed up the destroyers for duties escorting larger ships. In the future, ships were never to be sent out one by one. The British realised it was foolish to have sent Arethusa into battle with inadequate training and jammed guns. British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect: this criticism later proved counter-productive when at the Battle of Dogger Bank, ships became excessively cautious of wasting ammunition and thus missed opportunities to damage enemy vessels.|$|E

Better economy also allowed for higher running distances without stops for resupply and higher speeds made for more efficient running of the expresses on which the P class served, primarily on the Great Southern and Eastern Goldfields railways to Albany and Kalgoorlie respectively. Experiments into engine pooling with the P class on the Great Southern Railway in 1932 led to the adoption of this practice across the system, freeing up further locomotives for other duties.|$|E

30|$|The {{system is}} {{implemented}} {{on a single}} FPGA chip of type xc 3 sd 3400 a-fgg 676 - 5 c. The developing environment is ISE 11.5. Very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL) is used in our project for unit implementation to achieve special function, while C language {{is used in the}} MicroBlaze soft core. The system clock is 40 MHz (offered by camera board), and clock frequency is doubled by DCM clock manger for some special units such as line detection unit and the MicroBlaze soft core. The <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage of each unit is shown in Table 1. As previously discussed, we choose ρ[*]∈[− 23, 23] as the range of the parameter space and n[*]=[*] 8 in our experiment. Parallel parameter n[*]=[*] 8 is chosen for two reasons. One is that the θ of a lane is laid between [10 ∘, 170 ∘]; thus, the improved parallel Hough transform divides the range of θ into eight pieces. In each piece, the ranges of θ are 20 ∘. Therefore, only one lane marking is detected as the candidate in each piece. The other reason for n= 8 {{is that it is a}} compromise between <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage. The <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage for the proposed system is illustrated in Table 1.|$|R

25|$|While in an organization, it is {{important}} to focus on traits and functionalities of leaders from within, it is also key to focus on the relational side of leadership. Being relational with leaders/followers allows for relationships to be built. While looking at the two different models (vertical dyad linkage theory and leader–member exchange theory), different perspectives from each side are gained. For an organization to be democratic, the LMX theory supports the claims of it. The influence of VDL model helped get LMX theory to where it is today. Usually the assumption is leaders can only build close relations with trusted assistants due to lack of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources.</b> Leaders developing relations usually results in partnerships with certain followers, but leaders have the responsibility to make relations and offer partnerships to all of the followers (Hackman & Johnson, 2009, pg. 94). Making partnerships with all of the followers will increase the performance of the organization as a whole. Once this relation is built a relation trust is built and more information is able to be revealed to the organization leader.|$|E

40|$|One typical {{use case}} of {{large-scale}} distributed computing in data centers is to decompose a computation job into many independent tasks and run them in parallel on different machines, sometimes known as “embarrassingly parallel ” computation. For {{this type of}} computation, one challenge is that the time to execute a task for each machine is inherently variable, and the overall response time is constrained by the execution time of the slowest machine. To address this issue, system designers introduce task replication, which sends the same task to multiple machines, and obtains result from the machine that finishes first. While task replication reduces response time, it usually increases resource usage. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the trade-off between response <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage. We show that, while in general, there is a tension between response <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage, there exist scenarios where replicating tasks judiciously reduces completion <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> usage simultaneously. Given the execution time distribution for machines, we investigate the conditions for a scheduling policy to achieve optimal performance trade-off, and propose efficient algorithms to search for optimal or near-optimal scheduling policies. Our analysis gives insights on when and why replication helps, {{which can be used}} to guide scheduler design in large-scale distributed computing systems. ...|$|R
