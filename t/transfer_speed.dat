5|$|Thunderbolt {{combines}} PCI Express and Mini DisplayPort {{into a new}} {{serial data}} interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of 10Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20Gbit/s.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Titan used Jaguar's 10 PB of Lustre storage with a <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of 240 GB/s, but in April 2013, {{the storage}} was {{upgraded}} to 40 PB with a transfer rate of 1.4 TB/s. GPUs {{were selected for}} their vastly higher parallel processing efficiency over CPUs. Although the GPUs have a slower clock speed than the CPUs, each GPU contains 2,688 CUDA cores at 732 MHz, resulting in a faster overall system. Consequently, the CPUs' cores are used to allocate tasks to the GPUs rather than directly processing the data as in conventional supercomputers.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that operates at 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel, the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of memory, which allows the game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
50|$|Current {{wireless}} <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> are 10 Mbit/s.|$|R
5000|$|File sharing {{protocols}} {{have been}} completely rewritten. They now allow much higher <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> and better performance, and <b>transfers</b> feature a <b>speed</b> graph to track download/upload.|$|R

25|$|However, as of 2011, Seagate {{specifies}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of {{some hard}} disk drives with IEC binary prefixes {{in addition to}} decimal units.|$|E
25|$|Another {{benefit is}} its {{prefetch}} buffer, which is 8-burst-deep. In contrast, the prefetch buffer of DDR2 is 4-burst-deep, and the prefetch buffer of DDR is 2-burst-deep. This advantage is an enabling technology in DDR3's <b>transfer</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Opera Mini {{was derived}} from the Opera web browser. Opera Mini {{requests}} web pages through Opera Software's compression proxy server. The compression server processes and compresses requested web pages before sending them to the mobile phone. The compression ratio is 90% and the <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> is increased by two to three times as a result. The pre-processing increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones. However, interactive sites which depend upon the device processing JavaScript do not work properly.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 2004 fiber-optic {{and satellite}} Internet connections permitted <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> up to a gigabit per second.|$|R

5000|$|The UDP tracker {{is better}} {{optimized}} and puts less {{strain on the}} tracking server. Neither tracker has any effect on <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|Corporate {{computer}} environments {{may still}} {{make use of}} floppy disks for older machines that {{do not support the}} current company networks and, in the case of laptops, where Wi-Fi is not considered secure. The floppy disk provides for a controlled means of file transfer by permitting only a few files to be transmitted. This is as USB ports on enterprise computer terminals/workstations are often disabled in order to prevent employees from using a flash memory drive to take large amounts of data for unauthorized use. The capacity limit and low <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of the floppy disk are advantages in this case. In addition, the loss of a floppy disk has less consequence than the loss of any modern piece of removable flash storage, and furthermore, the floppy disk, being much larger than most flash memory card formatssome of which are smaller than a fingernailis harder to lose.|$|E
25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 {{enables the use of}} up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E
25|$|When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer {{displays}} the full source and destination path, size {{and number of}} items and the <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped {{and the rest of}} the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to apply the same action to further conflicts, if any. Also, for the first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until now, every folder and subfolder obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.|$|E
50|$|SAS {{connectors}} {{are much}} smaller than traditional parallel SCSI connectors, allowing for small 2.5 in drives. Commonly, SAS provides for point data <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> up to 12 Gbit/s.|$|R
50|$|DCH (Dedicated Channel) - The {{state that}} allows for maximum data {{connectivity}} throughput data <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds,</b> hence allowing for full power consumption as if Fast Dormancy was completely turned off.|$|R
50|$|Because of Amazon's USB driver implementation, the first-generation Kindle Fire {{suffered}} from slow USB <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds.</b> For example, <b>transferring</b> an 800MB video file {{may have taken}} more than three minutes in 2011.|$|R
2500|$|By default, Opera Mini opens one {{connection}} to the proxy servers, which it keeps open and re-uses as required. This improves <b>transfer</b> <b>speed</b> and enables the servers to quickly synchronize changes to bookmarks stored in Opera Mini server.|$|E
2500|$|After {{determining}} that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card {{to switch to}} a higher <b>transfer</b> <b>speed.</b> Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a [...] "Default Speed" [...] clock rate of 25MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power. Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.|$|E

50|$|The {{shift to}} VTL also {{eliminates}} streaming problems that often impair efficiency in tape drives as disk technology does {{not rely on}} streaming and can write effectively regardless of data <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 3490E tape drives were {{available}} {{from a variety}} of manufacturers with bus and tag, ESCON, or high voltage SCSI interfaces, and were capable of data <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> up to 20MB per second.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{computers}} {{based on}} Intel's Ultrabook specifications became available. These specifications dictate that Ultrabooks use an SSD. These are consumer-level devices (unlike many previous flash offerings aimed at enterprise users), {{and represent the}} first widely available consumer computers using SSDs aside from the MacBook Air. At CES 2012, OCZ Technology demonstrated the R4 CloudServ PCIe SSDs capable of reaching <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> of 6.5 GB/s and 1.4 million IOPS. Also announced was the Z-Drive R5 which is available in capacities up to 12 TB, capable of reaching <b>transfer</b> <b>speeds</b> of 7.2 GB/s and 2.52 million IOPS using the PCI Express x16 Gen 3.0.|$|R
