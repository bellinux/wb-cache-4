40|$|<b>The</b> {{determination}} of <b>consolidation</b> characteristics forms {{an important aspect}} {{in the design of}} foundations and other earth-retaining structures. <b>The</b> conventional <b>consolidation</b> test as originally proposed by Teaaghi takes considerable time (more than 15 days in highly compressible soils with low coefficient of consolidation) and effort. Any effort to reduce the duration of testing will be desirable from several considerations. In this paper, an attempt has been made to propose a rapid method of <b>consolidation</b> testing. In <b>the</b> proposed method, the next load increment is applied as soon as the necessary time required to identify <b>the</b> percent <b>consolidation</b> is reached and to evaluate <b>the</b> coefficient of <b>consolidation</b> by one of the popular curve-fitting procedures. The rectangular hyperbola method has been used to identify <b>the</b> percent <b>consolidation</b> reached after any load increment, and to determine <b>the</b> coefficient of <b>consolidation,</b> before making <b>the</b> next load increment. The time required to complete the test using <b>the</b> rapid <b>consolidation</b> method could be as low as 4 - 5 h compared with 1 or 2 weeks in the case of <b>the</b> conventional <b>consolidation</b> test...|$|R
