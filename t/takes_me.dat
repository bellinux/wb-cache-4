500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you." ...|$|E
500|$|In Charlotte, Benjamin {{stayed in}} the home of a Jewish {{merchant}} as surrender negotiations dragged. [...] Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. [...] When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, [...] "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone". When he bade John Reagan goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going. [...] "To the farthest place from the United States, if it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to the middle of China." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Say It Right" [...] is {{performed}} with a moderate techno groove and {{is written in}} F minor. It is set in common time; in 4/4 count. The chord progression is Fm–E♭–D♭–B♭m. Furtado's vocal range spans from Ab3 to F5. Furtado has cited the [...] "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" [...] of the band Eurythmics, particularly their 1983 song [...] "Here Comes the Rain Again", as an influence on [...] "Say It Right" [...] and other tracks on Loose. [...] "I'm not 100 percent sure what [...] about, but it always <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> away to another place, and I love it", she said. In fact the song deals with mystic or transcendental experiences as she explains {{in an interview in}} 2007. [...] "It {{is a kind of a}} magical song. It has a mystery to it, that I have not quite figured out. It has a haunting twist to it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first episode}} (1:41+) begins disjunctively with an abrupt tape splice. The refrain's B, which had {{received}} a dominant (V) charge, is now maintained as a tonic (I). There is harmonic ambiguity, in that the chord progression may be either interpreted as I–IV–I (in B) or V–I–V (in G). Stebbins says that this section [...] "might be called a bridge under normal circumstances, but the song's structure takes such an abstract route that traditional labels don't really apply." [...] A new sound is created by tack piano, jaw harp, and bass relegated to strong beats which is subsequently (1:55) augmented by a new electric organ, bass harmonica, and sleigh bells shaken on every beat. [...] The lone line of vocals (aside from non-lexical harmonies) is [...] "I don't know where, but she <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> there" [...] sung in Mike Love's upper-register baritone. [...] This section lasts for ten measures (6 + 2 + 2), which is unexpectedly long in light of previous patterns.|$|E
500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} slept for over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> a lifetime".|$|E
500|$|Atkins's thirteenth single, [...] "It's America", was {{released}} in November 2008. It was the first single from his third album, It's America, released in March 2009. Atkins promoted the album through appearances on Larry King Live and a pre-sale promotion on his website. On the chart dated May 2, 2009, [...] "It's America" [...] became his fifth number 1 hit. Its followup, [...] "15 Minutes", {{was released}} in May 2009 and peaked at number 20 in September. Atkins re-wrote the album's third single, [...] "Chasin' Girls", for his wife {{to make it more}} applicable to their life at the time. After executives at Curb saw the lyrics, the re-written version was released as the album's third single, but did not make top 40. [...] "Farmer's Daughter" [...] followed in early 2010, and after it reached top 5 late in the year, Curb added it and the re-recording of [...] "Chasin' Girls" [...] to a re-issue of It's America. The label also re-released If You're Going Through Hell for exclusive sale at Cracker Barrel restaurants, with [...] "Farmer's Daughter" [...] and the previously-unreleased song [...] "More Like Your Memory (Always <b>Takes</b> <b>Me</b> Back)" [...] added to the track listing.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McCown-Levy graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', calling it [...] "a {{fast-moving}} and fun adventure, {{the kind of}} race-against-time scenario that remains the series’ strong suit [...] played to the show’s strengths on numerous levels". He highlighted Johnson's fight against the prisoners, and Woods' direction of that scene, {{as well as the}} heart-to-heart between Johnson and May. McCown-Levy also felt [...] "the show is having the most narratively efficient season yet, effectively balancing mission-of-the-week adventures with the longer plots", but was critical of Lucy and the low stokes of the villains. Terri Schwartz at IGN scored the episode an eight out of ten, indicating a [...] "great" [...] episode, and said the highlight was the action and choreography. Schwartz also noted character-focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, [...] "Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> out of the episode whenever they appear. Because of that ... "Lockup" [...] didn't pop as much as last week's [...] "Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire".|$|E
500|$|For the costumes, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{designer}} Marlene Stewart. She expanded {{on the idea}} of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". For [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna reused the Stewart designed black bustier worn by her in the video, complete with tassels, golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg. Stewart's other designs included a Flamenco style dress for [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and a gold lamé jacket for the [...] "White Heat" [...] sequence. On the medley sequence, Madonna used a dress that was visually amusing and, according to Madonna, was for [...] "anyone that <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> too seriously, or imagined and I take myself too seriously." [...] Inspired by Dame Edna Everage, the dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. The knickers were inscribed with the word [...] "Kiss". Continuing her tradition of message clothes, she spelt out the phrase [...] "You Can Dance" [...] on her jacket, using the letter U, a can of soup and the word [...] "dance" [...] at the back.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine {{called it}} [...] "a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy, 'Roxanne'-esque new-wave groove to a soulful, synth-driven chorus." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters further {{explained}} the track, writing, [...] "It starts out like an early Police single, with some straight-up Reggatta de Blanc syncopation and a shockingly good Sting vocal impression. But the chorus opens up {{to turn into}} something less Police-y and more, dare I say it, Bruno Mars-y." [...] Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the song [...] "channels the Police, but its 21st-century builds owe as much to rave-pop as they do to producer Mark Ronson. It's an ill-omened meeting that somehow gels." [...] Jason Lipshut of Billboard gave a very positive review, stating that [...] "'Locked out of Heaven' is Mars' best solo single to date, with the singer-songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading-man act. Sometimes, the perfect lead single is hard to find; other times, it walks right {{up to you and}} delivers a big, cozy hug." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix praised [...] "Mars' singing and the catchy little background vocals," [...] which according to her, [...] "keep the song moving downstream at a rapid pace." [...] She also noted that [...] "Even clumsy lyrics like 'your sex <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to paradise' can’t diminish that joy that the beats and melody bring." ...|$|E

500|$|Bell {{was drafted}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Bell did not get much playing time early in the 1976 season with the Giants. [...] In late November, {{columnist}} David Bushnell wrote an article, [...] "Are Giants missing the boat on Gordon Bell?," [...] questioning the team's lack of utilization of Bell. [...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays." [...] The Giants' starting running back in 1976 was Doug Kotar, though Bushnell opined that Bell was the superior back: [...] "Bell is quick, with speed to break any play for a long gain, and he can catch the ball[...] [...] [...] If the Giants are trying to break Bell in gradually, they might just miss the boat totally, breaking Bell instead." [...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> about a quarter or so to get going, break a sweat and get the legs loosened up. [...] I really don't like being shuffled in and out so much, but as a rookie I can't do much about it." [...] Bell also added, [...] "Sure it's been hard for me to be a spot player, especially because my body isn't ideal for that type job. [...] I think it's better for me to play a lot, but then again I'm not the coach." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Yolande Geralds, who also directed the clip for Songz's previous single. [...] "I Invented Sex." [...] The video was filmed on October 7, 2009. Wynter Gordon, DJ Clue as well as Jessica White performing {{the owner of the}} Party make appearances in the video. Stills from the clip were released on the following day, October 8, 2009. A combination video was released for the dual clips of [...] "Say Aah" [...] and [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] and the videos were also released separately. Songz confirmed to MTV News in November 2009 that the latter would be a continuation of the previous. On the video, Songz said that he wanted the video to be [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "adult" [...] in which everyone had fun. He further explained, [...] "The song speaks on more so a club atmosphere, but the video is more lofty — sexy women all over the place, adults having fun. This one lady in particular, she's representing the independent women without taking it over the top. She's got her own. She <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> back to her crib — so we invent sex together." [...] In a review of the video, calling the song itself [...] "ballerific", Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy said, [...] "the video keeps it pretty grown in sexy", commenting the choice of button down shirts as attire and commending Fabolous's part, which he said, [...] "has a very plain-spoken feel to it, and because his blue-framed shades are matching his shirt.".|$|E
500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that is so good that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
