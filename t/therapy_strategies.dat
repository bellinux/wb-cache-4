50|$|Treatment {{is similar}} to that for other forms of {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular. ERP is {{based on the idea that}} deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person obsessed by blasphemous thoughts while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible. However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. Cognitive therapy may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible. Other <b>therapy</b> <b>strategies</b> include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP. Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.|$|E

He is highly regarded in the fields of hepatology and stem cell biology {{for the development of the}} [...] "Fah mouse model", a transgenic mouse with an inactivating mutation (exon 5 deletion) in sequence encoding fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah). This mouse strain has been a useful model of hereditary tyrosinemia, a human genetic disease caused by inactivating mutations in the Fah gene. The primary result of FAH deficiency is liver failure. Dr. Grompe made the important discovery that transplantation of even small numbers of hepatocytes to the liver of a Fah mutant mouse could lead to liver regeneration. In this context the survival and growth of cells able to contribute to liver function is positively selected, because the mutant hepatocytes in the recipient are unable to divide and are functionally impaired. The transplantation of cells to Fah-deficient mice has been and continues to be a critical test of hepatocyte-like function. In addition, it has been a useful model for gene therapy; if the mutated Fah gene is be repaired or replaced in a sufficient number of cells, liver function is restored. More recently, Dr. Grompe's lab has shown that if the Fah mutation is combined with mutations conferring immune deficiency (the FRG or Fah-/- / Rag2-/- / Il2rg-/- mouse), human hepatocytes can be transplanted successfully. These xenografted animals can contain >95% human cells, and have been used to model diseases such as malaria and to optimize human gene <b>therapy</b> <b>strategies.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA more {{effective}} gene <b>therapy</b> <b>strategy</b> for lung cancer using sequential cisplatin administration and adenovirus-mediated p 53 gene transfer was developed {{on the basis}} of our previous observation of enhanced expression of a reporter gene in malignant cells exposed to cisplatin before gene transfer. Transfer of the normal (wildtype) p 53 gene into cisplatin-treated H 1299 cells, in which p 53 is homozygously deleted, resulted in up to a 60 % further inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro than p 53 transfer into untreated H 1299 cells. The cisplatin plus p 53 gene transfer strategy yielded significantly greater apoptosis and tumor growth suppression in an animal model of subcutaneous H 1299 tumor nodules than wildtype p 53 gene transfer alone. The timing of cisplatin administration and p 53 gene transfer was shown to be critical: cisplatin administration simultaneous with or subsequent to p 53 gene transfer was less effective than cisplatin-first sequential treatment. Moreover, the in vivo inhibition of tumor growth was maintained by repeated cycles of treatment. This gene <b>therapy</b> <b>strategy</b> has been incorporated into a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of lung cancer and provides a basis for the development of improved therapeutic protocols.
