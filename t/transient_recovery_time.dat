40|$|When {{breaking}} large {{currents in}} switching devices, arcs are created, which continue {{to carry the}} current. It is desirable to extinguish these in order to break the current. In this master thesis {{a model of the}} arcs behavior during current zero-crossings was made and put into a module, which is to be used when simulating electrical AC arcs. The module will be used when designing switches, e. g. contactors. When the current falls to 0 A there is a race between the <b>transient</b> <b>recovery</b> voltage and the dielectric strength, which determines if the arc will extinguish or restrike. The arc is extinguished if the dielectric strength is greater than the <b>transient</b> <b>recovery</b> voltage through the whole cycle.

30|$|Two {{previous}} studies [23, 50] show that longer traffic incident duration {{can result in}} longer <b>recovery</b> <b>times,</b> leading to severe congestion.

Detecting the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> was previously difficult because of the limitations in the fixed traffic detectors; few studies consider the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> [23]. The development of several emerging traffic-condition detection techniques currently provides an opportunity to detect or infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> duration. For example, INRIX or Baidu in China can provide real-time traffic conditions mostly based on floating car data of taxis, trucks, coaches, and other vehicle types. Such information can be used to infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> duration of an incident, and sometimes the simulation dynamic traffic assignment tool is also needed. One of the difficulties with this inference is how to identify the congestion cause, that is, whether the congestion is due to the incident independently or caused by other factors (e.g., recurrent congestion). Investigating the significant factors that influence the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> are possible with the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> data, which can be helpful in adopting appropriate traffic management strategies to reduce the incident influence. Thus, determining a proper method to infer or detect the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and corresponding method to analyse and predict it can be a future topic. An appropriate traffic theory model or method based on simulations may provide effective means to infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> of traffic flow conditions.|$|R
