5|$|In {{the absence}} of the resting Bradman, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Attendance was 17,000 {{on the first day of}} this two-day non-first-class match. Rain {{prevented}} any play on the second day. After a poor start that saw <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> to 22/3, McCool (64) and Miller (55) made half-centuries for the Australians. Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20, but none went on. Paceman Keith Jackson took 5/76 for the hosts. Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 1814, {{upon the}} arrival of the Sixth Coalition armies at Paris, Sérurier {{publicly}} destroyed the 1,417 captured enemy flags and personally burned the sword and sash of Frederick the Great as to not let <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> into the Allies' hands. The restored King Louis XVIII made Sérurier a Peer of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power. This caused him to lose his post at Les Invalides and his marshal's salary after Napoleon's second downfall. Despite his Bonapartist sympathies, as Peer Sérurier voted in favour of the death penalty for Marshal Michel Ney.|$|E

Dumas, Jani and Lieb's performance saw <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> from second to fourth place and Bernhard, Hartley and Webber's second-place result allowed them to move into fifth on 53 points. Porsche were the new leaders in the Manufacturers' Championship with 140 points; Audi were 16 points behind their nearest rivals and Toyota maintained third place on 71 points with five races left in the season.|$|E

While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol on a steep face. All of <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> down the cliff, but are rescued by firemen with a trampoline, and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E

Feeling his family should not go through so much trouble to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E

5|$|The Storm's 2012 season started very {{strongly}} with nine consecutive wins, the club's best start to a season {{up to that}} time. A five-game losing streak between Rounds 16 and 21, (the club's second worst losing streak to that time) saw <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> {{from the top of}} the ladder. However, from Round 22 forward they recovered their winning form and finished the regular season with five straight wins, ending the regular season in second place on the table. Storm began their finals campaign with a 24-6 win over South Sydney Rabbitohs. Storm played its fifth Preliminary Final in six years, this time defeating Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles 40-12 at AAMI Park, following this they then went on to claim their second official Premiership defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 14 – 4 in the Grand Final.|$|E
5|$|The coins of Ælfwald's reign are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} that were minted in East Anglia. The coinage of silver pennies known as sceattas expanded {{in his time}} and several types are attributed to East Anglian production. Most of <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> into two main groups, known as the 'Q' and 'R' series. Neither group bears a royal name or title and the authority by which they were issued cannot not established. The 'Q' series, which has some Northumbrian affinities, is most densely distributed in western East Anglia, along the Fen edge between the Wash and Cambridge. The R series, with bust and standard, derived from earlier Kentish types, is more densely distributed {{in central and eastern}} East Anglia, including the Ipswich area. According to Michael Metcalf, the 'R' series was also East Anglian, being minted at Gipeswic.|$|E
5|$|The {{two men are}} {{haunted by}} the fate the girl will suffer and {{formulate}} a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over {{what appears to be}} a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercrafts are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three of <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> into the abyss.|$|E

5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
25|$|SLOW RACE (50 metres of the track); six competitors. This {{race was}} very amusing; the riders tried their {{best not to}} go fast, without stopping; their {{contrary}} movements made <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> except for Mr. J. Darenty, student of the Grand Gymnasium, who won the prize.|$|E
25|$|Porter {{now had to}} {{consider}} the possibility that his vessels would be trapped. Although they were in no immediate danger, the Rebels could starve him out. He sent a message to Sherman outlining his predicament and urging him to hasten to the rescue.

25|$|Some {{chimpanzees}} use {{tools to}} hunt large bees (Xylocopa sp.) which make nests in dead branches {{on the ground}} or in trees. To get to the grubs and the honey, the chimpanzee first tests for the presence of adults by probing the nest entrance with a stick. If present, adult bees block the entrance with their abdomens, ready to sting. The chimpanzee then disables them with the stick to make <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> out and eats them rapidly. Afterwards, the chimpanzee opens the branch with its teeth to obtain the grubs and the honey.|$|E
25|$|With his vessels {{effectively}} trapped, Porter sent {{an urgent}} appeal {{for help to}} the Army, and then issued orders to his captains to prepare to destroy their ships rather than let <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> into enemy hands. The soldiers, with the personal prodding of Major General William T. Sherman, made a forced march that got to the flotilla on March 22. They easily drove off the Confederate patrols that were blocking the retreat, so Porter and his vessels were able to move back into Steele's Bayou. By March 27, the entire expedition {{was back on the}} Mississippi, having accomplished nothing.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies {{began in}} similar fashion but a top-order {{collapse}} saw <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> to 6/76 through the bowling of Madan Lal and Kapil Dev. However, from there on the pair of Jeff Dujon and Malcolm Marshall combined to take the West Indies past the 100 mark. However, Amarnath came in to bowl and took both of their wickets, leaving the West Indies at 8/124, before he trapped Michael Holding leg before wicket to take India to a 43 run victory. Amarnath had innings-best figures of 3/12 and he was commended for his all-round performance with the Man of the Match award.|$|E

25|$|Territorial {{authority}} {{districts are}} not subdivisions of regions, {{and some of}} <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> within more than one region. Taupo District has the distinction of straddling the boundaries of four different regions. Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Regional councils {{are responsible for the}} administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the territorial authorities administer local roading and reserves, sewerage, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters. Some activities are delegated to council-controlled organisations.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} display is the behavior of breaking branches, which {{all members of the}} group carry out. Even infants break small branches (or twigs), letting <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> to the soil, but the most spectacular is the alpha male who chooses large, dry branches which he hits with his hands and feet in spectacular jumps, so that they fall. Usually such branches make a tremendous sound as they fall through the other branches, {{and the members of the}} group become very excited and chatter loudly. This behavior is quite commonly discharged towards an observer when the animals have lost their fear.|$|E
25|$|United were {{expected}} to do well when Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for Barcelona, but the 1988–89 season was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th {{in the league and}} losing 1–0 at home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup Sixth Round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw <b>them</b> <b>fall</b> down to mid-table.|$|E
