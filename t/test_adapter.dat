40|$|Abstract—UML {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} in designing real-time systems. However, UML tools often lack support for verification. This paper describes an approach and a tool in which UML models used for designing real-time systems are translated into UPPAAL timed automata {{in order to}} take advantage of validation and verification support in the UPPAAL tool. This allows one to increase the quality of the UML models by complementing static validation via OCL with behavioral validation and verification using the UPPAAL model-checker. Having an implementation of the system under consideration, the obtained UPPAAL timed automata serve as input of the UPPAAL-TRON tool to perform online model-based conformance testing. The proposed approach also generates a skeleton of the <b>test</b> <b>adapter</b> required to interface the testing tool and the implementation under test. The approach and the tool are exemplified with a telecommunication case study. Keywords—UML; UPPAAL; model verification; model-based conformance testing; real-time systems. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} and coordinated usage of distributed resources for problem solution within dynamic virtual organizations {{can be realized}} with the Grid computing technology. For distributing and solving a task, a Grid application involves a complex workflow of dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks, scheduling and submitting jobs for solving those sub-tasks, and eventually collecting and combining {{the results of the}} sub-tasks into a final result. The quality assurance of Grid applications is a challenge due to the highly distributed nature of the Grid environment in which the Grid application is deployed. This paper investigates the applicability of the Testing and Test Control Notation (TTCN- 3) for testing the workflows of distributed Grid applications. To this aim, a case study has been created that consists of a distributed Grid application which includes a typical Grid application workflow; as the main contribution, this case study contains a corresponding distributed TTCN- 3 test suite that tests the correct execution of the Grid application TTCN- 3 test suite to a specific Grid environment, corresponding reusable <b>test</b> <b>adapters</b> have been implemented for the Grid middleware Globus Toolkit 4 (GT 4).

40|$|Product {{information}} exchange {{has been described}} by a number of standards. The 9 ̆ 3 Standard for the Exchange of Product model data 9 ̆ 4 (STEP) is published by ISO as an international standard to cover this exchange. 9 ̆ 3 Product Life Cycle Support 9 ̆ 4 (PLCS) is a standard developed as an extension to STEP, covering the complete life cycle information needs for products. PLCS uses Data Exchange Sets (DEXs) to exchange information. A DEX is a subset of the PLCS structure applicable for product {{information exchange}}. A DEX is specified in a separate document form the PLCS standard, and is published under OASIS. The development of DEXs is ongoing and changing, nine DEXs have been identified and are being developed within the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Each of the nine DEXs covers a specific business concept. Implementations based on the DEX specifications are necessary in order to send and receive populated DEXs with product information. The implementations add contents to a DEX structure in a neutral file format which can be exchanged. Interoperability between senders and receivers of DEXs can not be guaranteed, however, conformance testing of implementations can help increase the chances of interoperability. Conformance testing is the process of testing an implementation against a set of requirements stated in a specification or standard used to develop the implementation. Conformance testing is performed by sending inputs to the implementation and observing the output. The output is then analysed with respect to expected output. STEP dedicates a whole section of the standard to conformance testing of STEP implementations. This section describes how implementations of STEP shall be tested and analysed. PLCS is an extension of STEP, and DEXs are subsets of PLCS. Conformance testing for STEP is used as a basis for DEX conformance testing, because of the similarities between PLCS and STEP. A testing methodology based on STEP conformance testing and DEX specifications is developed. The testing methodology explains how conformance testing can be achieved on DEX implementations exemplified with a test example on a specific DEX. The thesis develops a proposed set of test methods for conformance <b>testing</b> DEX <b>adapter</b> implementations. Conformance <b>testing</b> of Export <b>adapters</b> <b>tests</b> the <b>adapter</b> 9 ̆ 2 s ability to populate and output a correct DEX according to the specifications in the applicable DEX specification. Conformance testing of the Import adapter verifies that the content of the populated input DEX is retrievable in the receiving computer system. A specific DEX, 9 ̆ 3 Identify a part and its constituent parts 9 ̆ 4, is finally used as an example on how to test a specific DEX specification. Test cases are derived from a set of test requirements identified from the DEX specification. Testing of these requirements is explained explicitly...|$|R
