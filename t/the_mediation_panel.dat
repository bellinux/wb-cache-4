40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> {{as one of the}} methods of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The main reason for choosing this topic was topicality of issues because in the last years <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> has been developing in our country. A relatively recent adoption of <b>The</b> <b>Mediation</b> Act No. 202 / 2012 Sb., which is effective since 1 st September 2012, contributed to this development. The thesis involves seven chapters that are further subdivided. In the Chapter One, basic information relating to an alternative dispute resolution are summarized. Characteristic features are shown there and there are more details of each method of ADR. Chapter Two examines basic characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> as a method of ADR. This chapter consists of four subchapters that analyze in more detail historical development of <b>the</b> <b>mediation,</b> basic characteristic features of <b>the</b> <b>mediation,</b> basic principles of <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> and finally also advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>mediation.</b> <b>The</b> status of the mediator is discussed in the Chapter Three of this thesis. The main focus is on the question of impartiality and independence of the mediator, as well as its duty of confidentiality.

40|$|Workplace {{mediation}} {{is increasingly}} used to mediate hierarchical labor conflicts face-to-face {{as well as}} online. Few studies however, have investigated such mediations. Therefore, {{little is known about}} the implications of parties' hierarchy and power on <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> process, its outcome as well as parties' satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> or perceptions of its effectiveness. This is even more so for the effects of (partly) online mediation in hierarchical labor conflicts. In the present dissertation, we wish to respond to these lacunae. The aims of the dissertation are threefold. First, we investigate the impact of formal hierarchical position on parties' experience of anger recognition on the part of the mediator and parties' evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>mediation.</b> Second, we examine whether <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> type used (face-to-face versus the use of an online intake) affects subordinates' and supervisors' satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>mediation.</b> Third, we explore whether parties' perceived power (both relational power and situational power) mediates the relation between hierarchical position and parties' satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>mediation.</b> Finally, we explore whether subordinates' and supervisors' perceptions of power experienced during <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> are affected by the use of an online intake. In sum, we investigate how hierarchical position, perceived power and <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> type used relate to parties' perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>mediation.</b> To answer these questions, we bring together three streams of literature: theories of power, mediation and computer-mediated communication. We adapt <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> model of Herrman (2006) to the context of workplace mediation and use this as an heuristic model for our research (Chapter 2). Then, we explore literature on computer-mediated communication and its potential relation to mediation (Chapter 3). After these theoretical investigations, we present empirical research. We use data from real mediation cases dealing with hierarchical labor conflicts. Both face-to-face mediations and mediations in which an online intake is used before joint sessions in <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> are included. Our data show that when involved in face-to-face mediations, hierarchical position affects parties' perceptions and evaluations of the mediation: Although both subordinates and supervisors perceive <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> as effective and feel satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>mediation,</b> supervisors perceive <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> as more effective (Chapter 4) and feel more satisfied (Chapter 5). Our findings reveal different processes for subordinates as compared to supervisors that relate to perceived effectiveness: whereas subordinates' perceptions of mediation effectiveness are affected by anger recognition (Chapter 4), this is not so for supervisors. However, when an online intake is used in <b>the</b> <b>mediation,</b> subordinates and supervisors feel equally satisfied, suggesting that the use of an online intake mitigated the effects of hierarchy (Chapter 5). We further show that perceived power acts as a mediator in the relation between hierarchical position and satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>mediation</b> (Chapter 6). We conclude the dissertation with a summary of our key findings and a discussion of theoretical and practical implications of our research. Then, we formulate some practical implications that may help to mediate hierarchical labor conflicts and outline valuable paths for future research (Chapter 7). <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  nrpages: 270 status: publishe...|$|R
