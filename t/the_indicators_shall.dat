40|$|The {{worldwide}} university rankings rank universities {{based on}} a set of indicators. However, each ranking system makes use of criteria and metrics of measurement defined according the purpose for which it was created. Thus, this paper aims to identify the indicators presented in the international literature on "university rankings". The selection of papers was conducted by the intervention instrument called Knowledge Development Process- Constructivist (ProKnow-C) which identified 32 articles published in the Web of Science and Scopus databases and freely available on the internet, aligned to the subject, and thus, composed the Bibliographical Portfolio (BP). Based on the analysis of the BP, it was found the existence of 19 university rankings. The most common indicators are related to infrastructure and reputation of the university and make use of bibliometric information, such as published articles, number of citations of articles and researchers and articles indexed in databases. It was also found that there are many different metrics used by rankings, however it should be noted that, from the purpose of the rankings, <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> <b>shall</b> be construct...|$|E
40|$|ENGLISH: 1 -page key {{messages}} Indicators {{are one of}} {{many sources}} to knowledge about patient safety. Which indicators we choose to use, determine the picture we are painting. How these choices are made and documented, are important sources of information when the results of <b>the</b> <b>indicators</b> <b>shall</b> be interpreted and comprehended. Many nations and international organizations use one or another form for formalized consensus processes {{in the development and}} choice of quality indicators for the health services. In this report we examine the principle behind the formalized consensus processes and describes one American method and two European tools which have been used for this purpose. In Norway, there are little or no tradition for conducting formalized consensus processes when choosing indicators within the health services. By building on the knowledge from other land and organizations within this field, we can implant this method by relative simple means. Developing medical quality registries and national indicators can profit from implementing formal consensus processes. There will be an extra cost by introducing this technique, but in the long term, the knowledge base will be sounder and less time used on developing and validating the indicators. Documentation of consensus processes provide extensive information about each single indicator and how it is considered within the medical environment. Strength and weaknesses for the indicators are documented, and are important background information for interpreting the results when the indicators are used. High cost for data collection may lead to exclusion of indicators, this is important knowledge to get the whole picture of information about sets of indicators. Transparency about indicator selection and the consequences of them are important factors in improving the understanding and use of quality indicators for the health services...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to achieve}} the {{pentagon}} analysis of macroeconomic stabilization in Romania, Czech Republic and Hungary in the period 2000 to 2013. It is a comparative analysis of the countries above mentioned {{in terms of the}} five key targets of economic policy, aiming the increasing, dynamic balance of each economy: economic growth rate, unemployment rate, inflation rate, the budget deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the current account deficit of the balance of payments as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. The main objective of each economy which passes from planned to market economy should be to cease the economic decline, followed by the elimination of internal and external imbalances and only after that it should be followed by a continuous growth process. All <b>the</b> above mentioned <b>indicators</b> <b>shall</b> be represented on an ad hoc graduated scale. The period of research was chosen so as to obtain a view of the macroeconomic policies in transition from one period to another, in order to highlight the common as well as the main differences in the approach used for economy stabilization. Therefore I have computed the graphical analysis of macroeconomic stabilization pentagon for the three countries in the period 2000 - 2013 to captures the dynamics of the economic policy mix. This benchmark tool shows the interdependence which exists between inflation and other important economic <b>indicators.</b> <b>The</b> events occurred in the period starting with 2007 / 2008 have raised the interest of economics researchers, highlighting the need for significant improvements in the surveillance of the economic and financial system. The global fragility generated concerns regarding the vulnerabilities and causes which led to the occurrence of such events, thus generating different measurement techniques. Despite all its advantages, this approach has a significant limitation consisting in the fact that it can only reveal a picture without surprising other imbalances that can create un-sustainability in the economy...|$|R
