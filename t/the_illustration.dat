5|$|Rothschild {{featured}} {{an illustration}} of the Guadeloupe amazon in his 1907 book Extinct Birds by the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans, based on the early descriptions. In 1916, the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway criticised <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> for differing from Du Tertre's description; Du Tertre supposedly only meant that the proximal primary feathers were yellow, whereas all the covert feathers are yellow in <b>the</b> <b>illustration,</b> apart from a red edge, and the head and underparts are slate.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> found in five different Geography textbooks in Romania. The analysis is based on several criteria: number, size, clarity, pedagogical usefulness. The following conclusions have been drawn: <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> are numerous; most of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> are too small and unclear to be efficiently used in the teaching activity; the purpose of some materials is purely illustrative; some illustrations are overcharged with details, which prevent children from understanding them. Authors and publishing houses are advised to choose <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> in <b>the</b> fourth class Geography textbooks more carefully...|$|R

5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see <b>the</b> <b>illustration)</b> is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.|$|E
5|$|Faramir {{appears in}} several {{illustrations}} created by John Howe, Ted Nasmith and Anke Eißmann for The Lord of the Rings and related products. One {{of the scenes}} from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting {{at the top of}} Minas Tirith. Eißmann apparently follows the book in presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising his recent recovery in <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> for the dialogue with Éowyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired.|$|E
50|$|Botticelli renders {{vertically}} {{the ground}} planes of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> of <b>the</b> {{second and third}} rounds of Inferno. Although <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> for <b>the</b> first three rounds depict different imagery, the vertical perspective links them into a single unit. The third round consists of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> for cantos XV, XVI and XVII, which depict the punishment of those who sinned by violence against God, nature and art.|$|R

5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} {{waterspout}} {{can occur in}} the same vicinity at the same time.

5|$|Placed in {{the family}} Rallidae—the rails—this species was {{originally}} described as Fulica Cajanea by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller, in his 1776 Vollständiges Natursystem. Müller based his description on <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> “Poule d’Eau de Cayenne” (Cayenne’s water hen) by French naturalist and artist Edme-Louis Daubenton in his Planches Enlumineés d’Histoire Naturelle. It was eventually moved to the new genus Aramides, the wood rails, by Jacques Pucheran in 1845, and the specific epithet was changed to cajaneus.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorphoses of Ovid {{has been}} {{illustrated}} by several artists through time. In 1563 in Frankfurt, a German bilingual translation by Johann Posthius was published, featuring the woodcuts of renowned German engraver Virgil Solis. <b>The</b> <b>illustration</b> of Myrrha depicts Myrrha's deceiving her father {{as well as}} her fleeing from him. In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of Metamorphoses was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard Picart. <b>The</b> <b>illustration</b> of Myrrha was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured Myrrha as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, the depiction of Myrrha showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles.

5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E
5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
