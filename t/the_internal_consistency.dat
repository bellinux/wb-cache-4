25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.|$|E

To improve ease of use, the [...] "a and b statements" [...] described above were removed, and respondents were instructed to endorse how they had been feeling during the preceding two weeks. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> for the BDI-IA was good, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of around 0.85, meaning that {{the items on the}} inventory are highly correlated with each other.|$|E
30|$|By observing <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> of <b>the</b> {{different}} subscales, it {{is observed}} that the most of them exceed the value of 0.60 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1995).

For this reason, it is recommended to exclude it from the analyses when its alpha value is less than 0.60.|$|R

30|$|Although {{the subscales}} {{contained}} {{only a few}} items, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> of <b>the</b> situation-specific subscales of motivation were all acceptable. The invested effort subscale assessed students’ test-taking motivation defined according to Baumert and Demmrich’s ([2001]) definition—willingness to engage on test items. We assigned the other subscales to the test-related facets (test attractiveness, usefulness of the test) and to the person-related facets (emotional state, worry, distraction) of test-taking motivation.|$|R
500|$|Dirac {{described}} the quantization {{of the electromagnetic}} field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators {{with the introduction of}} the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, {{it would be possible to}} perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, [...] in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} to the UCC caused a dual system in Soviet copyright law, with {{the effect that}} foreign works published after May 27, 1973, were actually granted a stronger copyright protection than Soviet works because for foreign works {{the definition of the}} UCC of [...] "publication" [...] applied, which was narrower than the definition of [...] "publication" [...] in Soviet law, which continued to be applied to Soviet works. The duality was also emphasized by the new licensing scheme. In the years following the {{accession to}} the UCC, considerable doctrinal confusion ensued amongst Soviet scholars on how to reconcile such dual treatment with the Soviet ideology or ideals. Scholars proposed further changes and clarifications beyond the changes necessary to conform to the UCC. Elst concludes that the accession to the UCC questioned <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of Soviet law and undermined several of its basic principles, and that the myriad of improvement suggestions by scholars actually caused new legal uncertainties.|$|E
2500|$|For many believers, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of the Jewish and Christian scriptures is {{important}} because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin. On {{the subject of the}} Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the Torah that [...] "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the Hebrew Bible or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that [...] "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected rabbinic leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies." [...] However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this [...] "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".|$|E
30|$|Before {{proceeding}} with the canonical correlation analysis, the study determined {{the extent to}} which the items in the questionnaire were related to each other. In this regard, an overall index of <b>the</b> repeatability or <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of <b>the</b> scale as a whole was computed to identify problem items that should be excluded from the scale.

40|$|Although {{coefficient}} alpha {{is the most}} widely used measure of <b>internal</b> <b>consistency,</b> it does not optimally describe <b>the</b> unidimensional <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> of a composite.

When <b>the</b> 1 -factor model does not fit the data, however, the meaning of such a coefficient is unclear.

40|$|Background: A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} describes the performance of dental fear questionnaires in various countries. We describe {{the psychometric properties of}} Greek versions of the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) and the Dental Fear Survey (DFS) in adult Greek patients. Methods: Greek versions of the MDAS and DFS were administered to two samples of adult dental patients. In the first sample, 195 patients attending one of three private practice dental offices in a large city in Greece completed the questionnaires in the waiting room before dental treatment. After treatment, their dentists (who did not know how the patients had answered the questionnaire) rated their anxiety during dental treatment. In the second sample, 41 patients attending a Greek university dental school clinic completed the questionnaire twice at two separate visits, in order to provide test-retest data. Cronbach's alpha was used to compute <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies,</b> while Spearman's rho was used to compute the testretest reliabilities. Construct validity was assessed by correlating the responses to the MDAS and DFS by Spearman's rho. Spearman's rho was also used to examine the criterion validities, by comparing the questionnaire responses with the dentists' ratings of anxiety. Results: <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> for <b>the</b> MDAS were 0. 90 and 0. 92 in the two samples; for <b>the</b> DFS, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> were 0. 96 in both samples.

30|$|Motivating {{potential}} of work This dimension was surveyed {{at the age}} of 52 with {{a modified version of the}} Job Diagnostic Survey from Hackman and Oldham (1975, considering the modification see Häfeli et al. 1983). The scale consists of the four subscales “skill variety”, “task identity”, “autonomy” and “task significance” with three items each. The response format reached from 1  = “never” to 5  = “always”. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> of <b>the</b> main scale proved to be good (. 77).|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is the number of items per subscale.

Due to the restricted testing time and the large number of questions in the student questionnaire, more items could not be implemented. However, good and substantial reliabilities confirmed the homogeneity of these scales.|$|R
30|$|Instrument {{reliability}} (stability) was assessed. <b>Internal</b> <b>consistency</b> {{reliability was}} examined by calculating the Cronbach’s coefficient {{for the total}} scales and for each factor.
