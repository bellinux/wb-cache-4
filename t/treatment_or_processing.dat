40|$|Surprising {{results have}} shown the {{formation}} of a secondary phase of hematite in co-ferrite. Co-ferrite based materials have been increasingly studied for magnetoelastic and magnetoelectric applications. Enhancement of the properties for such applications can be made by cation substitution, heat <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> <b>processing.</b> Often, samples whose compositions deviate from stoichiometry or targeted compositions are made.

This study shows that, when samples are made by the ceramic method, a secondary hematite phase forms with the spinel Co-ferrite phase. The origin of the hematite phase is related to the processing temperature, sintering environment and deviation from stoichiometric composition. Consequently, deviation from targeted or stoichiometric compositions may explain why properties of co-ferrite reported in literature vary...|$|E

Manufacturers of diffused aeration systems claim that converting from coarse bubble to fine bubble system should yield a 50 percent energy cost savings.

A 3 D-printed compact package for enclosing radio frequency (RF) electronics is built, that features on-package antennas for RF signal reception (for harvesting or communication) at orthogonal orientations. Conventional 3 D printing technologies often require significant amounts of time and supporting material to realize certain structures, such as hollow packages. In this work, instead of fabricating the package in its final 3 D form, it is 3 D-printed as a planar structure with “smart” shape-memory hinges that allow origami folding to a 3 D shape after heating. This significantly reduces fabrication time and effectively {{eliminates the need for}} supporting material, thus minimizing the overall manufacturing cost. Metallization on the package is performed by directly inkjet printing conductive inks on top of the 3 D-printed surface with a modified inkjet-printed process without the need for surface <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> <b>processing.</b> Inkjet-printed on-package conductive features are successfully fabricated, that are combined with RF energy harvesting electronics to showcase the proof-of-concept of utilizing origami techniques to build fully 3 D RF systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Process {{industry}} involves large plants; mainly {{operating in}} continuous form, to achieve economic mass production output. However {{in some situations}} process vessels and tanks are used, where batch processes, take place. These tanks often contain reactants and products in the liquid state. After <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> <b>processing,</b> valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the valve closing element and the tank or vessel, especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel. Moreover, no matter how accurately this amount is estimated to be isolated from the processed amount leaving the vessel, it will still contaminate with the processed product. From hygiene point of view, this may not be accepted. In this work a valve design is introduced; where no fluid is trapped between a process tank and the valve closing element. When the valve is opened the fluid flows to the outlet flow line without any contamination with unprocessed fluid. Thus a contamination free valve design is utilised to achieve hygiene design tanks or vessels used in batch based processes. Thus cheap equipment acquiring the hygiene requirements necessary for food and some other products that only can be achieved using expensive mass production lines is obtained...|$|E

The results of scanning were plotted in a form of contact potential difference (CPD) distribution map. Additionally, a histogram of CPD values distribution and statistical characteristics including the expectation of CPD mean value and histogram half-width were calculated either for the whole distribution or for each individual mode in a case of multimodal distribution. The spatial CPD distribution of A 99 aluminum and AMG- 2 alloy surfaces after electrochemical polishing and diamond finishing was studied. An additional study was held for AMG- 2 surface after the formation of 30 microns thick specific nanostructured alumina oxide surface layer. Higher quality surfaces have characterized as more homogeneous distribution of the physical properties (at half-width distribution histogram). Surfaces with higher mechanical strength and overall better mechanical properties found to have lower CPD values that correspond to higher electron work function and surface energy. The presence of the second mode in the CPD distribution histogram indicates the significant proportion of defect areas on the sample surface. Analysis of visualized CPD distribution maps using defined criteria allows detecting and characterizing such defects as residual stress areas, areas with reduced microhardness, surface contamination spots, corrosion defects. This provides the possibility of rapid nondestructive testing and diagnostic of precision metal surfaces, in particular the starting substrates for sensitive elements and sensory devices manufacture.  </p...|$|E

40|$|The goal in {{the heat}} <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> {{thermomechanical}} <b>processing</b> of steel {{is to improve the}} mechanical properties. For structural steel applications the general aim is to refine the ferrite grain size as this is the only method that improves both the strength and toughness simultaneously. For conventional hot rolling and accelerated cooling processes, it is difficult to refine the grain size below 5. μm without extensive alloying. However, it has been found that inducing transformation during deformation (i. e. dynamic transformation) can lead to grain sizes of the order of 1. μm, even in very simple steel compositions. The exact mechanism(s) for this transformation process are still being debated, and this has also been complicated by recent studies where such grain sizes can be obtained by static transformation from austenite that has been heavily deformed at low temperatures prior to the transformation. This chapter reviews the various major studies related in particular to dynamic transformation and considers the contributions from the deformed austenite structure developed prior to the transformation and the potential for dynamic recrystallisation of the ferrite. A key factor is proposed to be the early three-dimensional impingement of the ferrite which also provides an insight into cases where ultrafine grains are achieved statically. <br /...|$|R

However, a large number of studies in recent years have shown that microstructural stability is an unavoidable and very important issue for nc materials when they are practically used [2 – 4]. As one of the most common microstructural features, grain size is always given first priority during the production and processing of nc materials.

These results seem to be direct and visible, but it is inevitably being questioned due to the fact that such local observation is too microcosmic.

40|$|AbstractMany common {{foods like}} salad {{dressings}} or milk products are processed by high-pressure homogenization. Compared to conventional treatments, dynamic high pressures {{have been found}} to induce significant changes in the protein layer at the interface of these emulsions. But until now the influence of high-pressure homogenization on the functionality of proteins itself has only been scarcely studied. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the influences of high-pressure homogenization on the functional properties of lupin proteins of different lupin species because these proteins exhibit good functionality and can be applied as natural emulsifiers in food systems. Especially, the influences on the emulsifying and gelling properties of lupin proteins were studied. The gel strength and the emulsifying capacities of L. albus proteins were increased significantly after high-pressure homogenization with pressures up to 150 MPa at 35 and 60 °C, respectively. The protein solubilities were only barely influenced by homogenization. Completely different results were obtained for L. angustifolius proteins. The emulsifying properties could not be enhanced by high pressure homogenization, which might be due to the presence of different protein fractions in protein isolates of these two species. These results imply that high-pressure homogenization has interesting potential for enhancing functional properties of lupin proteins of L. albus L., while the functional properties of L. angustifolius proteins after homogenization remained similar. High-pressure homogenization is therefore likely to be a tool for enhancing protein functionality, especially for proteins having inferior functionality due to heat <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> prior <b>processing...</b>|$|R
