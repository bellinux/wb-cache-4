5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with what}} had gone before and what {{followed}} it was a small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever be persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E
25|$|And {{even more}} bands ceased <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> two {{successful}} albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy {{three of the}} greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: Invisible, Durazno Sangrando and Jardin de los Presentes. Pastoral, {{one of the last}} acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.|$|E
25|$|The match {{began with}} a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was {{seemingly}} {{the result of a}} defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the clock on the scoreboard runs out.|$|E

25|$|Following Tibet's {{unexpected}} offer, the Mount Everest Committee {{decided on}} an {{attempt on the}} summit for 1936 but preceded by a reconnaissance in the current year. Tom Longstaff had been very praising of the Nanda Devi trek and so this approach {{would be used for}} 1935 on Everest. The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 so that all the new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval. He {{would not be able to}} reach the region before July which was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the start of the monsoon but this would allow the team to find out whether the monsoon snow had sufficiently consolidated.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Let Me Down" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo (2009). Lewis co-wrote the song with Mike Elizondo, James Fauntleroy, Justin Timberlake and Robin Tadross. It was produced by The Y's and co-produced by Elizondo. Lewis and Timberlake carried out the vocal production. Having {{wanted to work with}} Timberlake for a long time, the collaboration came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>after</b> he had asked Lewis to perform at a charity concert he was holding in Las Vegas in October 2008. It was reported {{that they were going to}} cover Dolly Parton's song [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a duet, however they worked together on new songs for Echo instead, and [...] "Don't Let Me Down" [...] was created.

[...] "The Open Boat" [...] was published in the United States by Doubleday & McClure in April 1898 as part of the book The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure, which included additional works by Crane such as [...] "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", [...] "Death and the Child", and [...] "The Wise Men". The English volume, published simultaneously with the American one, was titled The Open Boat and Other Stories and published by William Heinemann.

500|$|The show's {{original}} three lifelines were [...] "50:50", {{in which}} the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers; [...] "Phone-a-Friend", which allowed the contestant to make a 30-second call to {{one of a number}} of friends (who provided their phone numbers in advance) and read them the question and answer choices, after which the friend provided input; and [...] "Ask the Audience", in which audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>after</b> which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant. 50:50 was eliminated at the end of the show's sixth syndicated season, only to be restored in season fourteen. Phone-a-Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11, 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using search engines and other Internet resources, unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what they already knew. From 2004 to 2008, there was a fourth lifeline called [...] "Switch the Question", earned upon answering question ten, {{in which the}} computer replaced, at the contestant's request, one question with another of the same monetary value; however, any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question.

Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being [...] "a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars and a half, writing [...] "It’s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarkson’s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original ‘American Idol’ may have found her niche." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of New York Post gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for [...] "getting completely into character" [...] and successfully delivering the emotion of the song. Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as [...] "a good song", he concluded his review by writing [...] "Even better, it’s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kelly’s heartbroken rage." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked [...] "Don't Rush" [...] at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing [...] "One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while.

2500|$|The Divine Comedy {{consists}} of 100 cantos, and the printed text left space for one engraving for each canto. However, only 19 illustrations were engraved, and most {{copies of the}} book have only the first two or three. [...] The first two, and sometimes three, are usually printed on the book page, while the later ones are printed on separate sheets that are pasted into place. [...] This suggests that {{the production of the}} engravings lagged behind the printing, and the later illustrations were pasted into the stock of printed and bound books, and perhaps sold to those who had already bought the book.

Faber also began placing light and shadow more calculatingly, achieving enhanced visual and spatial effects. His heightened conception of space showed itself in his Title Page Border with Greek and Roman Philosophers and Authors of Antiquity in 1522 and reached a peak in the last metalcut he executed for Holbein in Basel, the Title Page Border with Christ as Intercessor before God the Father, the Four Symbols of the Evangelists and the Mission of the Apostles, in 1523.
