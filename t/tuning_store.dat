50|$|The {{collector}} {{and publisher of}} Irish traditional music Breandán Breathnach visited Sliabh Luachra {{for many years and}} collected music from O'Leary. He intended to publish this material because he regarded O'Leary's playing as preserving the style and repertoire of the area. After Breathnach's death in 1985, Terry Moylan took up the work and published his collection of O'Leary's music in 1994.

40|$|Thanks {{to recent}} {{evolution}} of multimedia technology, to-day we often use computers as music recorders and players. Number of <b>tunes</b> <b>stored</b> in our computers is monotonically increasing, and therefore users often face difficulty while se-lecting tunes which {{they want to}} listen. To solve the problem, we aim visual selection of tunes based on their impression. This paper proposes a technique for automatically select-ing icons for music files. Main problem of the proposed tech-nique is matching of tunes and images based on their impres-sions, where the images are used as icons. The technique first extracts features from images and tunes, and calculate fitness of sensitivity words using Neural Network (NN). Forming multi-dimensional vectors from the fitness values, the tech-nique calculates Euclidian distances from tunes to images. The technique finally selects the closest images as the most matched images for each tune. We think users can visually recognize impressions {{of a set of}} tunes, and easily select preferable tunes, if the icons selected by the technique are displayed in folders of file systems. ...|$|R

50|$|John J. Thompson {{founded in}} 1998 True Tunes News {{out of his}} Wheaton, Illinois Christian record shop, True <b>Tunes.</b> The <b>store</b> itself, founded in 1989, with Chris Langill, was {{relatively}} unique because it focused exclusively on alternative Christian music {{at a time when}} Christian bookstores wouldn't carry products based on rock, hip hop, or other hard forms of music. In 1995 Thompson founded a live music club for Christian acts called True Tunes Upstairs. In 1997 the store, magazine, and related assets were bought by the Charlottesville, VA based company Journey Communications. Journey closed the shop in early 1998 citing lagging sales due to the spread of alternative Christian music to larger retailers, and turned operations to the printed magazine and the internet.|$|R
40|$|The fast tuner {{system for}} the two superconducting RFQs of the LNL heavy ion high current {{injector}} PIAVE was studied. The fast tuners (FT) correct the frequency variations, caused mainly by mechanical vibrations. The design, which was proposed by ANL (Argonne, USA), uses the fast switching of two capacitances by means of PIN diodes to change the total impedance at the coupling loop. The FT power dissipation depends on frequency <b>tuning</b> range, <b>stored</b> energy of the resonator and a coupling loop design. We estimated the power dissipation and the frequency variations using the MAFIA code, varying the position and {{the shape of the}} coupling loop. Analytical estimates are shown, that agree well with the results of the simulations. These results laid the groundwork of the fast tuner model measurements. ...|$|R

50|$|Between 1997 and 2002, the US based Christian Reggae group Christafari enjoyed notable {{popularity}} in Kenya through KTN, Family FM (now Radio 316) and <b>Tune</b> in Music <b>Stores.</b> During {{one of their}} visits to Kenya, they witnessed the tragic state of the Kibera slums {{in the capital city}} of Nairobi and composed the song Nairobi. Christafari's music is liked by Kenyan reggae fans but most them do not realize that Christafari's music is fundamentally Christian and not Rastafarian. This is probably because many Kenyan roots reggae listeners are poorly educated and do not understand English content in reggae songs.|$|R

5000|$|In an LC {{oscillator}} circuit, {{the filter}} is a tuned circuit (often called a tank circuit; the tuned circuit is a resonator) consisting of an inductor (L) and capacitor (C) connected together. [...] Charge flows {{back and forth}} between the capacitor's plates through the inductor, so the <b>tuned</b> circuit can <b>store</b> electrical energy oscillating at its resonant frequency. There are small losses in the tank circuit, but the amplifier compensates for those losses and supplies the power for the output signal. LC oscillators are often used at radio frequencies, when a tunable frequency source is necessary, such as in signal generators, tunable radio transmitters and the local oscillators in radio receivers. Typical LC oscillator circuits are the Hartley, Colpitts and Clapp circuits.|$|R
40|$|The LEP Q-meter {{allows the}} {{excitation}} and observation of transverse beam oscillations. The instrument {{is used for}} continuous tune measurements but also for single shot precision measurements of spectra which contain all resonances. As the repetition rate of signals at LEP is low the Q-meter has been conceived around two fast processors treating the beam data on-line at {{the pace of the}} LEP revolution frequency. The continuotis tune measurement is based on a phase-locked loop, implemented as an algorithm on the fast processors. The beam is excited sinusoidally and the frequency of the excitation is forced to follow the tunes by a phase lock. The measured <b>tunes</b> are <b>stored</b> into tables at fixed time intervals and are available for further analysis. The principal application of this mode is the monitoring of the machine tunes during critical procedures uch as energy ramping or beta squeezing. In order to keep the tunes constant deviations of the measured tunes from reference values are used to compute online corrections for the currents of the main quadrupole chains. Further applications of the continuous tune measurement are the observation of magnetic coupling between the CERN SPS and LEP and a dynamic measurement of chromaticity by using a RF modulation and calculating the chromaticity from the observed tune changes. 1...|$|R

The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. In South Africa, Store brands {{are sold}} {{throughout}} retailers {{in the country}} and categories are widespread - from beverages (milk, coffee, water, etc); including most confectionary categories; most household and toiletry categories; and from premium brands, to the more cost effective. Compared to the U. S and Europe, the South African market for store brands is not well developed; however, there are still mega opportunities in the own brand category, as the market is far from being saturated. Even though South African retailers are utilizing own brands as a means of differentiation, some studies are also indicating the lack of well <b>tuned</b> major <b>store</b> brand strategies and own brands were not perceived as of value by consumers as well. Therefore, this study is undertaken to establish a greater insight into consumer perceptions toward The No Name Brand food items by investigating the influence of selected economic, psychosocial and demographic variables. Without a solid understanding of the consumer, the available growth opportunities in the store brand category are likely to be missed. For retailers {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities in the store brand category a greater understanding of consumer behaviour is required. For that purpose, relevant theories and concepts of consumer behaviour are included in the literature review for the study...|$|R

5000|$|In 1982 the {{flagship}} Dub Vendor Record Store in Clapham Junction opened replacing the market stall with Papa Face and Phillip ‘Godfather’ Wilks controlling the counter, its familiar Lion logo proving a lasting landmark in the Junction for years after. In {{the early days}} the A-Class studio was {{in the basement of}} the shop and a successful dub cutting business owned by Chris Lane ran alongside the 4 and then 8 track recording facility before Fashion Records moved to Forest Hill. The larger premises at Clapham Junction enabled the shop and mail order to finally operate under one roof and the business continued to flourish. The eighties and nineties were the golden years for reggae sales in the UK and both stores and the mail order thrived. Shipments of fresh stock were coming in weekly from Jamaica and almost as frequently from the US and customers couldn’t get enough of the hot <b>tunes.</b> The <b>stores</b> adapted to the changing market in the new millennium, stocking more R&B and Hip Hop as the younger generation wanted other genres to go with their dancehall. We also catered for the resurgence in popularity of roots and dub, bringing respected UK roots pioneer Lol [...] "Disciple" [...] Bell-Brown in to the fold. Under his stewardship the mail order operation moved into the digital age with the launch of www.dubvendor.co.uk The growth of the online business meant that in 2011 the decision was made to close the store at Clapham Junction and concentrate solely online.

30|$|All these {{previous}} {{studies by the}} database community were based on static workloads, which restricts their use for constantly changing workloads [53, 54]. Dynamically adaptive variations of these concepts have been explored thoroughly {{in the design of}} modern datastores [53, 54, 61]. These methods are used in online data partitioning such as O 2 P, H 20 [60], etc., and disk based analytical databases [54, 63, 65]. In the Big Data ecosystem, most prominently the concepts of [56 – 59] have laid strong footing for the data layout design on HDFS [54, 65, 66]. Another use case has been in <b>tuning</b> of data <b>stores</b> [53, 67], such as a multi-store with HDFS and RDMS together, where every parameter of the datastore is not known apriori. Integration of both horizontal and vertical partitioning together [55] have led to the design of modern Column stores and NoSQL datastores, most popularly, Hbase [23], WideTable [54], RCFile [65], etc. There {{has been a lot of}} prior work done on caching and partitioning, which are the predecessors of multi-tier storage.

40|$|Multistore systems utilize {{multiple}} distinct data {{stores such as}} Hadoop’s HDFS and an RDBMS for query processing {{by allowing}} a query to access data and computation in both stores. Current ap-proaches to multistore query processing fail to achieve the full po-tential benefits of utilizing both systems due to {{the high cost of}} data movement and loading between the <b>stores.</b> <b>Tuning</b> the physical de-sign of a multistore, i. e., deciding what data resides in which store, can reduce the amount of data movement during query processing, which is crucial for good multistore performance. In this work, we provide what we believe to be the first method to tune the physical design of a multistore system, by focusing on which store to place data. Our method, called MISO for MultISstore Online tuning, is adaptive, lightweight, and works in an online fashion utilizing only the by-products of query processing, which we term as opportunistic views.

We propose a multidimensional data structure that contains a novel combination of a grid array and several bitmaps. The base data is clustered in an order matching that of the index structure. The bitmaps contain one bit per block of data, motivating the term "blockmap. " The proposed data structures are compact, typically taking less than one bit of space per row of data. Partition boundaries can be chosen in a way that reflects both the query workload and the data distribution, and boundaries are not required to evenly divide the data if there is a bias in the query distribution. We examine the theoretical performance of the data structure and experimentally measure its performance on three modern CPUs and one GPU processor. We demonstrate that efficient multidimensional access can be achieved with minimal space overhead...|$|R

40|$|In a {{merchandise}} depth test, {{a retail}} chain introduces new products {{at a small}} sample of selected stores for a short period prior to the primary selling season and uses the observed sales to forecast demand for the entire chain. We describe a method for resolving two key questions in merchandise testing: (1) which stores to use for the test and (2) how to extrapolate from test sales to create a forecast of total season demand for each product for the chain. Our method uses sales history of products sold in a prior season, similar to those to be tested, to devise a testing program that would have been optimal if it had been applied to this historical sample. is defined as minimizing the cost of conducting the test, plus the cost of over- and understocking of the products whose supply is to be guided by the test. To determine the best set of test stores, we apply a -median model to cluster the stores of the chain based on a store similarity measure defined by sales history, and then choose one test store from each cluster. A linear programming model is used to fit a formula that is then used to predict total sales from test sales. We applied our method at a large retailer that specializes in women's apparel and at two major shoe retailers, comparing results in each case to the existing process used by the apparel retailer and to some standard statistical approaches such as forward selection and backward elimination. We also tested a version of our method in which clustering was based on a combination of several store descriptors such as location, type of store, ethnicity of the neighborhood of location, total store sales, and average temperature of the store location. We found that relative to these other methods, our approach could significantly improve forecasts and reduce markdowns that result from excessive inventory, and lost margins resulting from stockouts. At the apparel retailer the improvement was enough to increase profits by more than 100 %. We believe that one reason our method outperforms the forward selection and backward elimination methods is that these methods seek to minimize squared errors, while our method optimizes the true cost of forecast errors. In addition, our approach, which is based purely on sales, outperforms descriptor variables because it is not always clear which are the best store descriptors and how best to combine them. However, the sales-based process is completely objective and directly corresponds to the retailer's objective of minimizing the understock and overstock costs of forecast error. We examined the stores within each of the clusters formed by our method to identify common factors that might explain their similar sales patterns. The main factor was the similarity in climate within a cluster. This was followed by the ethnicity of the neighborhood where the store is located, and the type of store. We also found that, contrary to popular belief, store size and location had little impact on sales patterns. In addition, this technique could also be used to determine the inventory allocation to individual stores within a cluster and to minimize lost demand resulting from inaccurate distribution across size. Finally, our method provides a logical framework for implementing micromerchandising, a practice followed by a significant number of retailers in which a unique assortment of merchandise is offered in each store (or a group of similar <b>stores)</b> <b>tuned</b> to maximize the appeal to customers of that store. Each cluster formed by our algorithm could be treated as a "virtual chain" within the larger chain, which is managed separately and in a consistent manner in terms of product mix, timing of delivery, advertising message, and store layout.
