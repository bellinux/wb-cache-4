40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{measurements}} of contrast sensitivity {{at a distance}} in patients submitted <b>to</b> <b>penetrating</b> keratoplasty versus patients submitted to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus treatment. METHODS: Contrast sensitivity of 15 subjects submitted <b>to</b> <b>penetrating</b> keratoplasty and 15 subjects submitted to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty have been analyzed through the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (F. A. C. T®) 301. RESULTS: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the measurements for penetrating keratoplasty and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity was similar among the subjects submitted <b>to</b> <b>penetrating</b> keratoplasty and <b>to</b> deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus treatment...|$|R

5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, {{the adoption of}} ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs are too small <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely {{not strong enough to}} break human skin.|$|E

5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|The Mk.8 APC (Armor-Piercing, Capped) shell weighed 2,700lb (1225kg) and was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships.

5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E

5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially undamaged, the Italian shells having been unable <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> her armor.|$|E
5|$|As Roman {{troops were}} spread {{increasingly}} thin over its long border, the Empire's territory continued to dwindle in {{size as the}} population of the empire declined.

In 451, the Romans defeated Attila the Hun, but only with assistance from a confederation of foederatii troops, which included Visigoths, Franks and Alans. As barbarian incursions continued, some advancing as far as the heart of Italy, Rome's borders began to collapse, with frontier forces swiftly finding themselves cut off deep in the enemy's rear.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>penetrate</b> the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
40|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} due to diaphragmatic injury after penetrating thoracic trauma Diaphragmatic injuries due <b>to</b> <b>penetrating</b> traumas <b>to</b> the thorax progress insidiously.
