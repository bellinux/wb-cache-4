Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had {{to contend}} with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.|$|E

25|$|Towards an Anthropology of Women (1975), which Rapp edited {{under the}} name Rayna Reiter, brings {{together}} articles that examine the historical structures that influence gender and inequity across cultures, but does so without <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the universality of womanhood, according to June Nash. Nash views the collection as simultaneously promoting the study and understanding of both women and anthropology.|$|E
25|$|Note that Opel prices {{appear to}} be {{inherently}} higher than Ford ones. A common mistake {{in a lot of}} examples <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that VAT rebates form as a trade barrier is, to set retail prices equal for both Ford and Opel. This way, prices are initially equal, but become different after all the additional VAT taxes and rebates described below. Such an approach {{does not take into account}} the simple fact that Opel prices in the table above always include VAT while Ford prices never include it. That's exactly why additional adjustments are made in VAT taxation.|$|E
25|$|The {{age of the}} Swedish-speaking {{population}} in the territory that today constitutes Finland was a subject of fierce debate in the early 20th century {{as a part of}} the Finland's language strife. Some Finland-Swede scholars like Ralf Saxén, Knut Hugo Pipping and Tor Karsten used place names <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the Swedish settlement in Finland dates back to prehistoric times. Their views where opposed mainly by Heikki Ojansuu in the 1920s. In 1966, the historian Hämäläinen (as referenced by McRae 1993) addressed the strong correlation between the scholar's mother-tongue and the views on the age and continuity of the Scandinavian settlement history of Finland.|$|E

25|$|Mathematical {{induction}} {{is a form}} {{of direct}} proof, usually done in two steps. When <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a given statement for a set of natural numbers, the first step, known as the base case, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the inductive step, is to prove that, if the statement is assumed to be true for any one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number as well. Having proved these two steps, the rule of inference establishes the statement to be true for all natural numbers. In common terminology, using the stated approach is referred to as using the Principle of mathematical induction.|$|E

Discovering that Madame Masque is {{displaying}} symptoms of demonic possession, Doom has Tony trap her in the Iron Man Armor then proceeds to exorcise the demon from her. Doom disappears before Tony regains consciousness. Doom appears once again and interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara.

25|$|The American lawyers’ {{argument}} can be summarized as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that “invisible injury” occurred in the region. Large sums of money rested {{on the results of}} this case as the decision would affect various other smelting projects across North America; as such, the lawyers representing Cominco successfully limited the definition of damage to the actual, observable, economic damage. Lawyers on both sides were well practiced with substantial experience. R.C. “Judge” Crowe, VP of Cominco and a Montreal Corporate Lawyer, and John E. Read represented Cominco. The U.S. hired Jacob G. Metzger, a State Department attorney with experience in negotiating international claims. Metzger had a habit of not writing his arguments down, and when he died in 1937 the American scientists and lawyers went into the hearing unprepared.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} legal dramas (e.g., The Defenders, Matlock, Perry Mason and L.A. Law), the court {{proceedings}} are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the arraignment of defendants,the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond {{the testimony of}} witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually {{as a result of}} plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.|$|E
25|$|Clarissa Hailsham-Brown is {{the second}} wife of a Foreign Office diplomat, Henry, and {{stepmother}} to his teenage daughter, Pippa. They are currently living at Copplestone Court, a large house they are renting at a very cheap price in Kent. There are three guests staying with them: Sir Rowland Delahaye, a local Justice of the Peace in his fifties, Hugo Birch, an irascible man in his sixties and a young man called Jeremy Warrender. Sir Rowland and Hugo are {{taking part in a}} contest devised by Clarissa to test three different types of Port whilst Jeremy is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the timing achieved by a previous guest to the house in running to the lodge gates and back three times. Both contests however are spoofs designed by the fun-loving Clarissa to occupy her guests' time as their golf match has been rained off.

25|$|While {{dialogue}} {{can involve}} {{two or more}} people having conversations about opposing view points, it is not dialectical {{because there is no}} thesis or antithesis. In dialetical debates, all parties engaged are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the other wrong (which is what modern day psychotherapy boils down to). Rather, dialogue is more of a fusion of horizons, to use Gadamer’s term. When Dasein engages in dialogue with others, his horizon effectively fuses with the horizons of others. These horizons are polyphonic (multi-voiced) and fuse {{for the sole purpose of}} achieving higher truth and understanding. Put differently, the horizons of two polyphonic individuals are fused together during dialogue in such a way that both horizons are influenced and edified as opposed to one winning out over the other, and as opposed to one horizon remaining the same while the other that is judged to be wrong, or could be, is changed. Hermeneutics states that fusing horizons with others involves memory and imagination. It is through dialogue that memory and imagination enables therapists to empathically envision (intropathy) the horizon of their clients and further fuse it with their own.|$|E

25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as fallacious.|$|E
25|$|The society held {{monthly meeting}} to discuss new books, share folklore, deliver presentations, debate on ways to stop Germanization. The {{meetings}} took place not only in Tilsit, but also in Memel (Klaipėda), Coadjuthen (Katyčiai), Kaukehmen (Jasnoje), Ragnit (Neman), Lasdehnen (Krasnoznamensk), Schmalleningken (Smalininkai). The number of attendees grew from a dozen to 300. However, the quality of presentations and discussions was limited by lack of education among Birutė's members, most of whom only had primary education. In {{one of the early}} meetings, Vilius Bruožis, future chairman of the society, spoke for three hours <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the Lithuanian language was spoken in the Garden of Eden. The society considered and took tentative steps to establish Lithuanian-language schools, publish books (including a history of Lithuania that would incorporate the history of Lithuania Minor), its own newspaper, or calendars, but those plans were not realized. The society considered but rejected the idea of taking over the publication of bankrupt Aušra. Instead, it financially supported (15 marks per month) the short-lived newspaper Garsas published by Jankus. In 1888, the society officially dropped book publication from its goals and reduced the number of meetings to once a quarter. In total, between 1885 and 1888, the society held about 30 meetings.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
