5|$|Although the {{tradition}} declined in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-twentieth century, {{in part due}} to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century.

5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed {{in the city and}} suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th {{century the}} reach and {{influence}} of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. <b>The</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the Baltic coast, the north German and Polish regions, the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland. At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments. The mid-century saw the development of art dealership as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{arose in}} Cappadocia {{relatively}} late with {{no evidence of}} a Christian community before the late second century AD. Alexander of Jerusalem was the first bishop of the province in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities. The community remained very small throughout the third century: when Gregory Thaumaturgus acceded to the bishopric in c. 250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea.|$|E

Internationally, he gained three England caps between 1926 and 1931. In total he played 407times for Manchester City, putting him 12th in terms of all-time appearances. In 1935, he transferred to Bradford City, and subsequently moved to Mossley as player-manager.|$|E

5|$|French chemist Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, {{a combination of the}} thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown's fight song is rare among U.S. {{university}} fight {{songs for}} mentioning other colleges by name.

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore {{is characterized by a}} noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Hensley {{married for}} the third time, but his wife, Inez Hutcheson, left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage. After their separation, Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga. During services, he began asserting that he had been {{miraculously}} healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal-mining accident. Kimbrough disputes his claim, noting that there is no one-year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering. Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s; he moved to Athens, Georgia, in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{while living}} in Los Angeles, Mitchell bought a home in Blue Hill, Maine.

In the 1993 film Gettysburg, set during the American Civil War (1861–65), he portrayed the real-life Union Army flag bearer Sergeant Andrew Jackson Tozier. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> mid-2000s, he survived three cancers and then moved back to Blue Hill with his family, where he semi-retired while occasionally appearing in local stage productions.|$|E
