25|$|A {{week before}} his 69th birthday, he was {{bedridden}} and infirm. His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> was by his bedside {{next to a}} radio tuned to ABC Radio National. I leaned over to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 {{model year}} VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico {{were just a}} {{facelift}} {{due to the lack}} of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> and over the top right corner of the glovebox door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a sliding lever instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger's side one over the top left corner of the glove box door and driver's side one integrated to the cover under the steering column, could only be obtained with the A/C system.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1975, a {{base model}} called the 2CV Spécial was {{introduced}} with the 435cc engine. Between 1975 and 1990 {{under the name}} of AZKB [...] "2CV Spécial" [...] a drastically reduced trim basic version was sold, at first only in yellow. The small, square speedometer (which dates back to the Traction Avant), and the narrow rear bumper was installed. In order to keep the price as low as possible, Citroën removed the third side window, <b>the</b> <b>ashtray,</b> and virtually all trim from the car. It also had the earlier round headlights. From the 1978 Paris Motor Show the Spécial regained third side windows, and was available in red and white; beginning in mid-1979 the 602cc engine was installed. In June 1981 the Spécial E arrived; this model had a standard centrifugal clutch and particularly low urban fuel consumption.|$|E

2500|$|The Majestic's new format was {{an instant}} hit with {{sophisticated}} film-goers and Madison's counterculture at large. As the city's only art house cinema, it cultivated a fiercely loyal patronage that appreciated the herbal tea, cider and fresh popcorn with real butter for sale at its concessions stand. Midnight shows were often preceded by announcements of coming attractions delivered from the floor by the manager, along with the policy that [...] "we don't care what you smoke" [...] {{as long as it}} was smoked near <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> at the top of the balcony stairs. The outdated equipment was dismissed as a concern, with manager Bob Strong saying their loyal patrons [...] "come for what's on the screen and not to hear a new sound system." [...] Projectionist Bob Monshein fondly dubbed the non-automated 1939 projectors [...] "Neandermation." [...] During a 1983 appearance to benefit Madison Repertory Theatre, film critic Roger Ebert called the Majestic [...] "a temple of art and sacred to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{was embarrassed}} by her bedroom: the broad couch {{with a cover}} of violet silk, mauve {{curtains}} striped with gold. Chinese Chippendale bureau, and an amazing row of slippers, with ribbon-wound shoe-trees, and primrose stockings lying across them. His manner of bringing the ash-tray had just the right note of easy friendliness, he felt. [...] "A boob like Verg Gunch would try to get funny about seeing her bedroom, but I take it casually." [...] He was not casual afterward. The contentment of companionship was gone, and he was restless with desire to touch her hand. But whenever he turned toward her, the cigarette was in his way. It was a shield between them. He waited till she should have finished, but as he rejoiced at her quick crushing of its light on <b>the</b> <b>ashtray</b> she said, [...] "Don't {{you want to give}} me another cigarette?" [...] and hopelessly he saw the screen of pale smoke and her graceful tilted hand again between them. He was not merely curious now to find out whether she would let him hold her hand (all in the purest friendship, naturally), but agonized with need of it.|$|E

25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was the first}} to permit smoking in rooms on the State floor. To accommodate smoking, Jacqueline Kennedy wanted portable <b>ashtrays</b> for <b>the</b> East Room. She initially considered modified versions of <b>ashtrays</b> seen at <b>the</b> home of her friend, Bunny Mellon, but rejected this idea in favor of a unique design. Maison Jansen designed stands which featured brass legs shaped like bamboo, brass handles, and Carrara glass tops. <b>The</b> <b>ashtrays</b> cost $280, were manufactured in Maison Jansen's New York City office, and delivered in January 1963. Finding the cost too high (and without any economy of scale cost-savings), Kennedy then designed her own portable standing ashtrays. Twenty were eventually manufactured out of dark wood by White House carpenters, although the gray granite tops for <b>the</b> Kennedy-designed <b>ashtrays</b> were made by Jansen at a cost of $310.|$|R

5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust.

Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in <b>the</b> <b>ashtrays</b> to kill <b>the</b> smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|R

50|$|In 2004, to {{mark the}} 20th anniversary of the release of Rattlesnakes, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions {{reformed}} to perform a one-off tour of the UK and Ireland which generated some media interest, mostly in UK broadsheets. The reformation was never intended to be permanent, and Cole released another solo album in 2006, Antidepressant, using his usual home recording outfit by playing all the instruments himself with friends like Sobule, Derby and the guitar work of former Commotion Neil Clark on some tracks. The follow-up Broken Record, released in September 2010, marked a departure from his solo recordings, as it was performed by a band of longstanding friends and working partners, including Fred Maher, Joan Wasser, Rainy Orteca, Dave Derby and Blair Cowan - {{as well as two}} musicians, Matt Cullen (guitar; banjo) and Mark Schwaber (guitar; mandolin), with whom Cole tours, billed as Lloyd Cole Small Ensemble. The recording of the album was entirely financed by advance purchases by his fans and contributions from Tapete Records, which later distributed the album and also oversaw and negotiated the rights to release a boxed set with his complete collection of b-sides, alternative takes and previously unreleased material, under the title Cleaning Out <b>the</b> <b>Ashtrays.</b>|$|R

While cleaning up after their final party before returning to their unhappy lives, Alabama remarks — an interesting contrast to the closing lines of The Great Gatsby — that emptying <b>the</b> <b>ashtrays</b> is [...] "very expressive of myself.

50|$|Hamilton Basso wrote {{two novels}} looking at Long, Cinnamon Seed (1934) and Sun in Capricorn (1942). Perry (2004) says Basso was a slashingly witty {{critic of the}} {{moonlight}} and magnolia romanticism of the Old South that dominated the Southern mind before 1920. Like many proponents of a New South, he wanted modernizers to take over. Cinnamon Seeds Harry Brand incorporates more details from the historical Long than any other fictional portrayal does, {{and much of the}} novel is so lightly fictionalized that only a single letter separates the names of characters and places from their real-life counterparts. Brand is a representative of the grasping and vulgar kind of new leadership which has rightly understood that the values of the Old South are played out but has replaced them with nothing but ambition and cunning. He is a greedy climber, not a demonic leader of the masses, and in fact he is ultimately not much more than an obnoxious and sticky-fingered lout, the kind who spits tobacco juice on the marble floors of his predecessors and pockets <b>the</b> <b>ashtrays.</b> In portraying his Long figure this way, Basso finds himself between the stools, critical of the spent aristocrats who cannot imagine a modern South, but disgusted also by the figures who represent the wrong kind of newness, the kind of modern South that comes to be if its development is left to default.|$|R
