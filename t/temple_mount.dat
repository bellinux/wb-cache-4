5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> Because of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E

5|$|The {{destruction}} of Robinson's Arch {{occurred during the}} events surrounding the Roman sacking of Jerusalem in 70CE. It has traditionally been blamed on the Roman legions which destroyed the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> enclosure and eventually {{set fire to the}} entire city. More recently, this has been attributed to the Zealot factions which had wrested control of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> and fortified it prior to its fall. Some of these continued to hold out in Jerusalem's Upper City for a month after the city had been breached by the Romans. By wrecking the overpass, as well as the viaduct at Wilson's Arch to the north, the defenders made access to the Temple platform much more difficult for besieging forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the Muslim Wakf {{authority}} {{controlling the}} Islamic structures atop the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> began illegally excavating {{large amounts of}} fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf would put it, restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque.

Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E

50|$|Baron <b>Mount</b> <b>Temple</b> was a {{title that}} was created twice in British history, both times in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first {{creation}} came on 25 May 1880 when the Liberal politician the Honourable William Cowper-Temple was made Baron <b>Mount</b> <b>Temple,</b> of <b>Mount</b> <b>Temple</b> in the County of Sligo. He was born William Cowper, the second son of Peter Clavering-Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper (see Earl Cowper for earlier history of the family) by his wife the Honourable Emily, sister of The 2nd Viscount Melbourne. Emily married as her second husband The 3rd Viscount Palmerston, {{a man who would}} serve as British Prime Minister. Lord Palmerston, an Anglo-Irish peer, died in 1865 when the viscountcy and his junior title of Baron <b>Temple,</b> of <b>Mount</b> <b>Temple,</b> became extinct. Emily died 11 September 1869, leaving her second husband's estates, including Broadlands in Hampshire, to her second son, William, who thereupon adopted by Royal licence the surname Cowper-Temple, in whose favour the <b>Mount</b> <b>Temple</b> title was revived in 1880.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that Robert Hamilton, an archaeologist who worked on the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations.

5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount.</b> It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

5|$|Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against {{inserting}} {{fingers into}} the cracks of the Wall as {{they believe that the}} breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially raised {{portion of the}} <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom of}} the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables just beneath the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had {{been a matter of}} lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> platform as a clue to the Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> and north-west of the City of David.|$|E
