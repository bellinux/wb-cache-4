5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} depression and Tropical Storm Alda, Tropical Disturbance D2 developed in the Mozambique Channel, initially subtropical in nature. On February20, a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique, spawning an area of convection. A weak low pressure area developed on February23, which proceeded to move southeastward. Due to unfavorable wind shear, the system failed to organize much, although initially it produced strong wind gusts. On February28, much of the convection {{was removed from the}} circulation, which looped over southwestern Madagascar to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. On March4, when Tropical Storm Davina was named, the disturbance was renamed E1. The next day, the circulation executed a small loop, dissipating on March6 over eastern Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had {{turned back to}} the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Rita was {{the most}} {{damaging}} typhoon to affect northern Japan since 1965. A tropical depression developed on August9, 1975 over the South China Sea. The depression initially meandered offshore Taiwan, but after turning west, it was upgraded into a tropical storm on August19, only to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. While growing considerably in size, Rita strengthened into a typhoon during the afternoon hours of the August21. Rita then accelerated to the north-northeast {{in response to a}} shortwave trough. Midday on August22, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145km/h (90 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 965mbar (28.5inHg). That evening, the typhoon weakened slightly before making landfall 55km (35mi) west of Osaka, with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Quickly crossing central and northern Honshu, Rita veered slightly northward before weakening into a tropical storm early on August23. On the next day, Rita merged with a cold front before transiting into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection to wax and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease in shear allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest. Moving back beneath an anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, with the small structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E

25|$|After {{traveling}} {{east for}} , SH-38 {{is forced to}} <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north by Kegelman Air Force Auxiliary Field, a secondary airfield of Vance Air Force Base. As the highway continues north, it forms the boundary between Kegelman AFAF {{to the east and}} the Great Salt Plains State Park to the west. Upon crossing the Salt Fork Arkansas River, the road turns back to the west, entering the park. Within the park boundaries, SH-38 is again forced to change course by the Great Salt Plains Lake, and turns back to a due north heading. One mile (1.6km) north of the turn, the highway passes through the unincorporated place of Vining. SH-38 continues north, coming to an end at SH-11.|$|E

25|$|In the May 1994 election, the Socialists won a {{plurality}} of votes and 54% of the seats (with the new Prime Minister, Gyula Horn) after a campaign focused largely on economic issues and the substantial decline in living standards since 1990. This signaled a wish to <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relative security and stability of the socialist era, but voters rejected both right and left-wing extremist solutions – no such party gained seats in parliament. After its disappointing result in the election, leadership of the Fidesz party opted for an ideological shift from a liberal to a conservative party. This caused a severe split in the membership and many members left for the other liberal party, the SZDSZ, which formed a coalition with the socialists, leading to a more than two-thirds majority.|$|E
25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached the MAC VOR from the north, the pilot turned right, {{heading out to}} sea, 1.0 to 1.5nm before reaching the MAC VOR. This {{made it difficult to}} establish {{the aircraft}} on the proper outbound course, though this was eventually done. The aircraft began its descent on this outbound leg, but it failed to level off at the minimum altitude of 1,540 feet. At 2416:22, the last radar contact was recorded with the aircraft 200 feet below that altitude, still outbound, and still descending at 1,050 feet per minute. At 2418 (approximately 100 seconds after the last radar return) the pilot made his last call to the controller (who did not have radar), saying he had completed his base <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airport. Investigators believe the aircraft hit the water very soon after that transmission.|$|E
25|$|Not far to {{the east}} of US219, US219 Business and NY417 leave Salamanca upon {{crossing}} over Great Valley Creek, which serves as the boundary between Salamanca and the town of Great Valley.
