5|$|Contemporary Muslim astronomers also {{constructed}} {{a variety of}} highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and observatories, such as the water-powered astronomical clock by Al-Jazari in 1206, and the astrolabic clock by Ibn al-Shatir in the early 14th century. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> timekeeping astrolabes were the geared astrolabe mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century. These devices functioned as timekeeping devices and also as calendars.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with small}} bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Colorado River basin {{for at least}} 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large agricultural civilizations – some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> indigenous cultures in North America – which eventually faded due {{to a combination of}} severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. Europeans first entered the Colorado Basin in the 16thcentury, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence in 1821. Early contact between Europeans and Native Americans was generally limited to the fur trade in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> and highly developed writing system {{of more than a dozen}} systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalized and consistent writing system.|$|E
5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
5|$|Islamic mathematicians gathered, {{organised}} and clarified {{the mathematics}} they inherited from ancient Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia and Persia, {{and went on}} to make innovations of their own. Islamic mathematics can be divided into algebra, geometry and arithmetic. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate, soon after Baghdad was founded in the mid-eighth century, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary trigonometrical techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as Ptolemy's Almagest and Euclid's Elements were translated into Arabic. By {{the second half of the}} ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticated</b> parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most mathematical works were written in Arabic, others in Persian.|$|E

5000|$|Historian of African American {{folk art}} practices, John Michael Vlach, has called carved walking sticks [...] "perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>sophisticate</b> form in <b>the</b> Georgia tradition." [...] Cooper carved thin canes, {{especially}} elegant in silhouette and design. As with other cane carvers in the African American tradition, Cooper frequently featured reptiles in his designs. His turtles, lizards, alligators, and snakes appeared on his canes in graphic relief, which he achieved {{through a combination}} of deeply carved outlines and staining techniques. His carved figures, which he polished, stood out above the grain of the wood, which he left natural.|$|R
