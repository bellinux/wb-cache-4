40|$|Abstract—The {{manufacturing}} of the non-circular pipes made by reshaping {{process is}} becoming more and more important because of their utilizations as in different industries. In this work, a reshaping process is presented with cold rolling of a circular thick tube into a square cross section between four flat rolls in different passes. The influence of the amount of roll gap reduction in each pass on the final rolled product was investigated. Quantities such as separated force energy, wall thickness, and corner radius of the tube were observed and measured.

40|$|The {{laryngeal}} articulator, {{consisting of}} the glottal mechanism, the supraglottic tube, the pharyngeal/ epiglottal mechanism, and including three levels of folds: the vocal folds, the ventricular folds, and the aryepiglottic folds, is shown {{to be responsible for}} the generation of multiple source vibrations and for the complex modification of the pharyngeal resonating chamber that accounts {{for a wide range of}} contrastive auditory qualities. Laryngoscopic evidence drawn from Tibeto-Burman, Semitic, Cushitic, Kwa, and Gur languages demonstrates the distinctive use of the laryngeal articulator in pharyngeal trilling combined with glottal voicing, voiceless pharyngeal trilling, and epilaryngeal <b>tube</b> <b>shaping</b> to create opposing vocal register series. One such series is the [ATR/–ATR] contrast...|$|E

50|$|The {{resonance}} of {{a tube of}} air {{is related to the}} length of the <b>tube,</b> its <b>shape,</b> and whether it has closed or open ends. Musically useful <b>tube</b> <b>shapes</b> are conical and cylindrical (see bore). A pipe that is closed at one end is said to be stopped while an open pipe is open at both ends. Modern orchestral flutes behave as open cylindrical pipes; clarinets and lip-reed instruments (brass instruments) behave as closed cylindrical pipes; and saxophones, oboes, and bassoons as closed conical pipes.Vibrating air columns also have resonances at harmonics, like strings.|$|R

40|$|A Galerkin=nite element and a pseudo-spectral method, in {{conjunction}} with the primitive (velocity-pressure) and streamfunction-vorticity formulations, are tested for solving the two-phase ow in a tube, which has a periodically varying, circular cross section. Two immiscible, incompressible, Newtonian uids are arranged so that one of them is around the axis of the tube (core uid) and the other one surrounds it (annular uid). The physical and ow parameters are such that the interface between the two uids remains continuous and single-valued. This arrangement is usually referred to as Core-Annular ow. A non-orthogonal mapping is used to transform the uneven <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> and the unknown, time dependent interface to xed, cylindrical surfaces. With both methods and formulations, steady states are calculated rst using the Newton–Raphson method. The most dangerous eigenvalues of the related linear stability problem are calculated using the Arnoldi method, and dynamic simulations are carried out using the implicit Euler method. It is shown that with a smooth <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> the pseudo-spectral method exhibits exponential convergence, whereas the nite element method exhibits algebraic convergence, albeit of higher order than expected from the relevant theory. Thus the former method, especially when coupled with the streamfunction-vorticity formulation, is much more ecient. The nite element method becomes more advantageous when the <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> contains a cusp, in which case the convergence rate of the pseudo-spectral method deteriorates exhibiting algebraic convergence with the number of the axial spectral modes, whereas the convergence rate of the nite element method remain...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike dhotis (Mundu), {{which are}} linear like sheets, lungis are {{sometimes}} sewn into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape</b> like a skirt. They are especially worn in hot regions. There are also cheaper [...] "open" [...] lungis, in identical dimensions but not sewn into a <b>tube</b> <b>shape.</b> The standard adult lungi is 115 cm in height and 200 cm in length, when open. Children's lungis {{are available in}} approximately 2/3 of this size. They are normally woven from cotton and {{come in a variety}} of designs and colors. Silk lungis are available for ceremonial purposes such as weddings. The most common styles are either solid-colored or plaid, reflecting the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of producing these patterns on a power loom. Blue is particularly popular, since it fades to pleasant tones in contrast to other colors. Regardless of the design or color, lungis are often lined at the top and bottom with a black/white stripe containing reinforced weaving to prevent fraying.|$|R

40|$|A {{circular}} {{tube bundle}} {{is one of}} the simplest geometries that is widely used for heat transfer applications. However, in the recent years, cross-flow heat exchangers with non-circular tube arrangement have been receiving increased attention. The main purpose of this work is to gain insight into the characteristics of heat transfer and fluid flow in different tube bundles arrangements: circular, ellipsoidal and wing-shaped, for heat exchangers taking into account local and bulk entropy generation. All <b>tube</b> <b>shapes</b> are investigated under similar operating condition. This could provide a new way for engineers to design an optimal network of heat exchangers allowing the enhancement of heat transfer and recovery in industrial applications. We conduct a two-dimensional numerical CFD model using finite volume discretization to evaluate the performance of these systems. The effects of pressure drop, exergy and enthalpy balances are both investigated. Entropy generation is sought in order to find the best tube bundles arrangement. Heat transfer correlations are obtained for different situations of <b>tube</b> <b>shapes</b> and suggestions are made for the best geometry that minimizes the total entropy generation (i. e. the irrevesibilities) ...|$|R
