40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{speculate}} the possible relationships between “word,” “text,” “textile,” and “clothing”. Many {{of the terms}} we use to describe our interactions with words are derived from the common linguistic root and numerous other expressions associated with reading and writing are drawn from the rich vocabulary of cloth. Textiles {{are one of the}} most ubiquitous components of material culture and they are also integral to the material history of texts. The intersection between texts and textiles locates the relationship between language and dress, as together they structure the fashion scene over the century. We compare these texts and storytelling with the process of making clothes, they go from fibers that are spun and then create the fabric or the material out of which the clothes are made. Besides the similitude of the words “text” and “textile” that have four similar letters there is also the resemblance in the way they transmit a message. While texts are meant <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the reader, to enchant and to create emotions in so various ways, just in the same way clothes are also meant to transmit emotions and feelings to the wearer or to the people watching them...|$|R
40|$|A presente tese estabelece um confronto entre dois textos literários: Os novos sofrimentos do jovem W. (1973), de Ulrich Plenzdorf, e Vermelho (2001), de Uwe Timm, o primeiro da antiga RDA e o segundo da Alemanha Ocidental, embora escrito e publicado após a reunificação. Eles retratam o conflito da juventude com a geração dos pais e a sociedade por volta de 1968. Apesar de contextos supostamente opostos ideologicamente, economia de mercado e Socialismo, constatam-se várias semelhanças no percurso dessas gerações dos dois lados da Cortina de Ferro. O narrador de Os novos sofrimentos do jovem W. faz seu relato após a morte enquanto o de Vermelho (2001) repassa sua vida nos vagos instantes entre acidente e morte. Suas narrativas resultam em um balanço de vida que apresenta as gerações do século XX em ambos os estados alemães e as relações entre elas. A opção dos autores por uma perspectiva {{post mortem}} é justificada pelas vantagens retóricas que a voz de um morto oferece junto ao leitor: a autoridade de quem concluiu a vida e possui experiência a transmitir aos que ficam. This thesis offers a {{comparison}} between two literary texts: The new sufferings of young W. (1973) by Ulrich Plenzdorf and Red (2001) by Uwe Timm. The first one is of the ancient GDR, and the second one, although written and published post-reunification, is of the Federal Republic of Germany. Both texts show the conflict of the young with the generation of their parents and society in the period around 1968. In spite of alleged contrary ideologies and politics – market economy versus socialism – one establishes many similarities {{in the development of}} these generations {{on both sides of the}} iron curtain. While the narrator of The new sufferings of young W. makes his speech after death, the narrator of Red (2001) has his entire life flash through his thoughts in his last instances between accident and death. Their narratives result in a reflection on life, which presents the inter-relationships between the generations of the 20 th century in both German States. The choice of a post mortem perspective by the authors can be explained by the rhetoric advantages, which has a dead voice with the reader: the authority of whom has finished his life on earth and has experience <b>to</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> those who stay...|$|R

50|$|On {{account of}} the poor {{survival}} rate of materials (cloth, leather) used for clothing, {{there is only a}} little archaeological evidence; contemporary images are rare.

5000|$|Joan Tuset, {{talks about}} {{connecting}} {{to a world}} allowing him to “express his ideas and thoughts”, art serving “to express and communicate our innermost feelings, emotions, thoughts and experiences”. [...] Our exchange, the power of art to communicate complex ideas and feelings transpired, by the strong impulse it can provide to the human being, aiming to “create freely and <b>transmit</b> <b>something</b> {{that can only be}} understood from the need to think and live as an artist”. Concepts found, as put by Tuset, in the essence of art, as it consists of “learning to see, to be aware that we are here, that we are alive”, [...] and art helps to link our inner world with the outside world.|$|R

30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{observation is}} that {{it is possible that the}} constraint ∑ _n= 1 ^Nρ _n≤ N' may not be equity, i.e., we would like to give up some sensing opportunity. This seemingly weird conclusion arises from our assumption that the transmitter always <b>transmits</b> <b>something</b> when it finds that the channel is idle. Consider an extreme example: suppose N′=N and q_n^*= 1, i.e., the transmitter has full sensing capability and the channel is always idle. If In,max are all sufficiently small and we sense all sub-channels (thus transmitting signal over all sub-channels), little information can be conveyed since In,max are all small. Therefore, it may increase the channel capacity to design a rule to determine whether to transmit over an idle and sensed sub-channel. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper.|$|R
