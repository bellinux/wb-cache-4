40|$|A {{key feature}} of the biscuit {{manufacture}} is {{the combination of the}} raw ingredients. Different oils are likely to change the quality of dough. The factors important in agglomeration of starch materials are poorly understood and therefore work was carried out to try and establish the behaviour of oil and water on the material properties of starches. An understanding of particle-particle behaviour in the presence of oils and water is relevant to a food production process such as biscuit making, that requires preparation and mixing of these ingredients at ambient conditions. The way these powders pack and flow could {{have a significant impact on}} the final quality of the product. Powder flow analyser was used to measure the caking and cohesion properties for different type of starches. Besides the powder type as a variable, three levels of water and four types of oils at 5 % (d. b) concentration were also tested. The presence of water with the powder plays an important role for the way the cereals powders pack and flow. Although <b>tapped</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> did not vary much the water had a great impact on the powder caking strength and cohesion index. For samples without oil, the results showed that these parameters were increased significantly as the water level increased for all starches.

30|$|The Carr's {{compressibility}} and Hausner indices {{were estimated}} as {{the ratios of}} the difference between <b>tapped</b> and <b>bulk</b> <b>densities.</b> The Carr's compressibility index gives an idea of how much a powder can be compressed, while Hausner index measures/estimates cohesion between particles; the values for both varies inversely with particle flow (Carr 1965; Wells 1988). For Carr's index, values in the ranges 5 to 10, 12 to 16, 18 to 21 and 23 to 28 indicate excellent, good, fair and poor flow properties of the material, respectively (Carr 1965). In the study, the indices for all the microcrystalline cellulose samples are approximately in the range 15 to 20 (fair-good flowability). On the other hand, for the Hausner ratio, a value of less than 1.20 indicates good flowability, whereas a value of 1.50 or higher suggests that the material will have poor flow properties. In our case, the Hausner ratio for the microcrystalline cellulose samples lie around the threshold of 1.20 (≈good flowability). Therefore, the values obtained for the Hausner ratio are consistent with those of the Carr's index. However, in both cases, the MCCA showed a little superior flow properties compared to microcrystalline cellulose samples obtained from maize cobs.|$|R

However, despite the automation of modern test equipment, it can be time consuming and expensive. In contrast, measurement of bulk density is straightforward and less laborious, and tapping devices are cheaper. Here we explore the relationship between Hausner ratio and cohesion and also examine correlation between Hausner ratio, σc/σy, and σpre for a suite of 13 milled and 2 spray-dried lactose powders, 3 sand samples and 3 samples of refractory dust; Hausner ratio is the ratio of <b>tapped</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> to loose bulk density, σc is major consolidation stress, σy is unconfined yield stress and σpre is preconsolidation stress. Cohesion and flow function were measured with an annular shear cell at values of σpre up to 5 kPa. Loose poured bulk density was measured following a modified New Zealand standard and tapped density measurement {{was based on a}} method for dry dairy products and the European Pharmacopoeia; Hausner ratio at 1250 taps was used. Our results show that cohesion at σpre of 0. 31 kPa, 0. 61 kPa, 1. 20 kPa, 2. 41 kPa, and 4. 85 kPa correlates linearly with Hausner ratio; the slope and intercept of the correlation are functions of σpre. A plot of σc/σy against Hausner ratio shows an exponential decay trend and regression yields two fitting parameters that correlate well with σpre. These correlations are potentially useful for assessing flow characteristics when shear testing cannot be performed...|$|E
40|$|In {{agglomeration}} using liquid binders, powders are agitated in {{the presence}} of liquid to form structured products but the detailed flow fields during processing have not been investigated. Systematic experiments have been performed in a mechanical mixer (diameter 250 mm) with ploughshare impellers to examine the effect of processing variables on the velocity fields and torque during agglomeration. Liquid to powder ratio, impeller rotation speed and initial powder volume fill were varied and agglomerate properties were measured. Coincident transitions of the mechanism of agglomeration and type of flow were induced by varying the impeller speed. At around 4 Hz the mode of the agglomerate size distribution increased rapidly together with an increase in <b>tap</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> a weakening of the agglomerates, and a change in the relationship between torque and time. Tracers were used to show that there was an associated change in the size enlargement mechanism from crushing and layering to coalescence. Detailed velocity information, obtained using a positron camera, showed that at around 4 Hz the particle angular velocity increased rapidly while mean axial velocity and the axial dispersion coefficient were greatest. Some particles left the bed as the transition from gravity-dominated to centrifuging flow occurred. For all conditions around 90 % of the agglomerates were moving at less than 30 % of the impeller tip speed and {{it is likely that the}} impeller Froude number (Fr) is not the appropriate criterion to designate the transition from gravity-dominated to centrifuging flow. For instance at 4 Hz (Fr= 8), around 5 % of the agglomerates and none of the sand had a particle Froude number (Fr p) greater than 1. At 6 Hz (Fr= 18), 20 % of the agglomerates and 5 % of the sand had Fr p >l. Hence the particle Froude number is a better criterion to determine the onset of centrifuging flow. Taken together, the agglomerate properties and velocity distributions were consistent with the current binary collision model for agglomeration. In order to further improve knowledge of agglomeration it is essential to conduct integrated studies of agglomerate properties and flow fields using well-defined systems together with physically-based approaches to modelling.

Meanwhile, flow properties measured by shear testing principle based on Jenike’s method simulated bulk wheat under pressure in bins/hoppers. The dynamic properties tested quantify the energy required to flow, compressibility and permeability at dynamic handling situations. Due to the presence of impurities and moisture content differences, <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose of wheat varied from 801. 54 kg/m 3 to 718. 36 kg/m 3, and 23. 6 ° to 38. 4 °, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of formulation excipients and physical characteristics of inhalation particles on their in vitro aerosolization performance, and thereby to maximize their respirable fraction. Dry powders were produced by spray-drying using excipients that are FDA-approved for inhalation as lactose, materials that are endogenous to the lungs as albumin and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC); and/or protein stabilizers as trehalose or mannitol. Dry powders suitable for deep lung deposition, i. e. with an aerodynamic diameter of individual particles < 3 microm, were prepared. They presented 0. 04 [...] 0. 25 g/cm(3) <b>bulk</b> <b>tap</b> <b>densities,</b> 3 [...] 5 microm geometric particle sizes, up to 90 % emitted doses and 50 % respirable fractions in the Andersen cascade impactor using a Spinhaler inhaler device. The incorporation of lactose, albumin and DPPC in the formulation all improved the aerosolization properties, in contrast to trehalose and the mannitol which decreased powder flowability. The relative proportion of the excipients affected aerosol performance as well. The lower the <b>bulk</b> powder <b>tap</b> <b>density,</b> the higher the respirable fraction. Optimization of in vitro aerosolization properties of inhalation dry powders can be achieved by appropriately selecting composition and physical characteristics of the particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{formulate}} the oral modified release tablets of Trimetazidine dihydrochloride by using Polyethylene oxide (Polyox WSR 303 LEO) (35 - 55 %) as a rate controlling polymer. The tablets were prepared by direct compression method and coated by using film coating polymers. The powder mixtures were evaluated for angle of repose, loose bulk density, <b>tapped</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and compressibility index and showed satisfactory results. All the ingredients were lubricated and compressed using 8. 5 mm circular shaped standard concave plain punches. The tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, content of active ingredient, thickness, friability, hardness and In-vitro dissolution studies. Drug content in the formulation was determined by UV- Visible Spectrophotometric method. All the formulations showed compliance with Pharmacopoeial standards. The in vitro release study of matrix tablets were carried out in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer for 12 hours. The prepared matrix tablets showed 100. 00 % release over a period of 12 hours. The dissolution profile of Formulation, F 5 was similar to Innovator product in three different media such as pH 1. 2, pH 4. 5 acetate buffer and pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer. It was observed that the amount of polymer in the tablets influences the drug release. In vitro release study results revealed that the release of the drug was retarded with the proportional increase in polymer concentration. It was indicated that the using a hydrophilic non-cellulose polymer in an appropriate concentration in tablet could control the rate of drug release...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{formulate}} the nicorandil sustained release matrix tablets by using Mangifera indica gum as rate controlling factor and to evaluate drug release parameters as per various release kinetic models. The Mangifera indica gum is extracted and evaluated for physicochemical and phytochemical property using official procedures. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. The granules were evaluated for angle of repose, loose bulk density, <b>tapped</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and compressibility index, showed satisfactory results. All the granules were lubricated and compressed and were evaluated for uniformity of weight, content of active ingredient, thickness, friability, hardness and In-vitro dissolution studies. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study revealed that there was no chemical interaction between drug and the gum used. All the formulation showed compliance with Pharmacopoeial standards. In-vitro drug release studies were carried out using USP 35 /NF 30 dissolution apparatus type II at 50 rpm (rate per minute). The in-vitro release study of matrix tablets were carried out for 12 h. The prepared matrix tablets were shown 97. 8 %, 96. 5 %, 96. 8 %, 90. 7 % and 86. 5 % release over a period of 12 h. A better sustained drug release of 96. 8 % was obtained with formulation F 3 at the end of 12 h. Optimized formulation F 3 was subjected to stability studies for three months, which showed stability with respect to release pattern. Mathematical analysis of the release kinetics indicated that the nature of drug release from the matrix tablets was dependent on gum concentration and it was found to be diffusion coupled with erosion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a sustained release matrix tablet of aceclofenac using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K 15 M and HPMC K 100 M CR) in various proportions as release controlling factor by direct compression method. The powders for tableting were evaluated for angle of repose, loose bulk density, <b>tapped</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> compressibility index, total porosity and drug content etc. The tablets were subjected to thickness, weight variation test, drug content, hardness, friability and in vitro release studies. The in vitro dissolution study was carried out for 24 hours using United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) 22 paddle-type dissolution apparatus in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4). The granules showed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility index and drug content etc. All the tablets complied with pharmacopoeial specifications. The results of dissolution studies indicated that the formulations F- 2 and F- 3 could extend the drug release up to 24 hours. By comparing the dissolution profiles with the marketed product, it revealed that the formulations exhibited similar drug release profile. From this study, a decrease in release kinetics of the drug was observed when the polymer concentration was increased. Kinetic modeling of in vitro dissolution profiles revealed the drug release mechanism ranges from diffusion controlled or Fickian transport to anomalous type or non-Fickian transport, which was only dependent on the type and amount of polymer used. The drug release followed both diffusion and erosion mechanism in all cases. The drug release from these formulations was satisfactory after 3 months storage in 40 0 C and 75 % RH. Besides, this study explored the optimum concentration and effect of polymer(s) on acelofenac release pattern from the tablet matrix for 24 hour period.

40|$|A flat die {{pellet mill}} {{was used to}} {{understand}} the effect of high levels of feedstock moisture content {{in the range of}} 28 – 38 % (w. b.), with die rotational speeds of 40 – 60  Hz, and preheating temperatures of 30 – 110  °C on the pelleting characteristics of 4. 8  mm screen size ground corn stover using an 8  mm pellet die. The physical properties of the pelletised biomass studied are: (a) pellet moisture content, (b) unit, <b>bulk</b> and <b>tapped</b> <b>density,</b> and (c) durability. Pelletisation experiments were conducted based on central composite design. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that feedstock moisture content influenced all of the physical properties at P  0. 88. The other pellet quality attributes such as unit, <b>bulk,</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>density,</b> were maximised at feedstock moisture content of 30 – 33 % (w. b.), die speeds of > 50  Hz and preheating temperature of > 90  °C. In case of durability a medium moisture content of 33 – 34 % (w. b.) and preheating temperatures of > 70  °C and higher die speeds > 50  Hz resulted in high durable pellets. It can be concluded from the present study that feedstock moisture content, followed by preheating, and die rotational speed are the interacting process variables influencing pellet moisture content, unit, <b>bulk</b> and <b>tapped</b> <b>density</b> and durability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>density</b> {{changes during}} {{alternative}} wetting and drying processes in soils, {{as well as}} during measurement of soil hydraulic properties, especially the soil water characteristic curve. However <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> is usually assumed to be constant. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> changes during water desorption measurement and the effects of these changes on soil hydraulic properties. Soil water characteristic curves were measured by a pressure plate technique for five soils with textures ranging from silt loam to clay loam. <b>Bulk</b> <b>densities</b> of the soils were determined at all equilibrium pressure values during the water desorption measurements. Measured water characteristic curves for the soils were described by the Brooks and Corey model. Measured water characteristic curves with changing <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> were compared with those derived from using four characteristic bulk densities-assigned, packing, averaged, and optimal-for five soils. Results showed that there were measurable changes in <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> during the pressure plate tests. For the four characteristic <b>bulk</b> <b>densities,</b> the differences between fitted Brooks and Corey soil water characteristic curves and those derived from measured <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> data at each pressure were the smallest for the optimal <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> The optimal <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> were associated with a pressure of about 0. 7 m. For each soil, estimated hydraulic conductivities and water diffusivities were smaller for larger characteristic <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> values. The hydraulic conductivities and water diffusivities estimated using measured <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> were smaller than those derived from any of the four characteristic <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> at volumetric water contents less than 30 %. The consideration of <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> change during measurement of soil water characteristic curves and its effect on soil hydraulic properties will be important for bridging the knowledge gap between water flow in hypothetical soils and water flow in real soils...|$|R

Previous studies (Potter et al. 2001; Reeder et al. 2004) have reported the positive correlation between <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and SOCS. A very small increase in <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> has increased the SOCS (Bolstad and Vose 2001). On the contrary, the negative correlation of <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> with SOCS was reported (Dar and Somaiah 2015). In the present study, temporal livestock trampling, particularly in the grassland, could have increased the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> but never affected the SOCS to decline. Experimental research in temperate and subtropical grasslands of South America by Pineiro et al. (2009) showed that an exclusion of cattle has decreased <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b>|$|R
