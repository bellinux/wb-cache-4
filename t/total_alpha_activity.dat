40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in numerous experiments that oscillatory EEG responses in the alpha frequency band (8 - 12 Hz) increase with memory load during the retention interval in working memory tasks. However, the findings diverge with respect to which measurement of alpha activity is influenced by memory processes. Here, we differentiate between evoked and <b>total</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in order to separate effects of phase-locking and amplitude modulation. We present data from a delayed-matching-to-sample task (S 1 -S 2 paradigm) for which we compared EEG alpha responses between a perception and a memory condition. Increased <b>total</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> {{was found in the}} retention interval for the memory as compared to the perception condition. Evoked alpha activity, however, did not differentiate between memory and perception conditions but, instead, was increased for the more complex condition of processing non-Kanizsa figures as compared to Kanizsa figures. Thus, our results demonstrate a functional differentiation between evoked and <b>total</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity.</b> While alpha phase locking seemed to be influenced mainly by task complexity, alpha amplitude clearly reflected memory demands in our paradigm...|$|E

40|$|Focusing one's {{attention}} by external guiding stimuli towards a specific {{area of the}} visual field produces systematical neural signatures. One of the most robust is the change in topological distribution of oscillatory <b>alpha</b> band <b>activity</b> across parieto-occipital cortices. In particular, decreases in <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> over contralateral and/or increases over ipsilateral scalp sites, respect {{to the side of}} the visual field where attention was focused. This evidence comes mainly from experiments where an explicit cue informs subjects where to focus their attention, thus facilitating detection of an upcoming target stimulus. However, recent theoretical models of attention have highlighted a stochastic or non-deterministic component related to visuospatial attentional allocation. In an attempt to evidence this component, here we analyzed <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in a signal detection paradigm in the lack of informative cues; in the absence of preceding information about the location (and time) of appearance of target stimuli. We believe that the unpredictability of this situation could be beneficial for unveiling this component. Interestingly, although <b>total</b> <b>alpha</b> power did not differ between Seen and Unseen conditions, we found a significant lateralization of <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> over parieto-occipital electrodes, which predicted behavioral performance. This effect had a smaller magnitude compared to paradigms in which attention is externally guided (cued). However we believe that further characterization of this spontaneous component of attention is of great importance in the study of visuospatial attentional dynamics. These results support the presence of a spontaneous component of visuospatial attentional allocation and they advance pre-stimulus alpha-band lateralization as one of its neural signatures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the alterations in central and peripheral psychophysiological measures and psychometric variables after experimental manipulation of the most important inhibitory transmitter system of the CNS, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. Vigabatrin (GVG), a new enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, which increases cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of GABA and other substrates of GABA transaminase, was given in single oral doses of 1 g, 2 g and 3 g to 10 normal healthy volunteers. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, 3 mg lorazepam was given as reference compound. Blood sampling for vigabatrin kinetics, EEG recordings and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at the hours 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24, and psychometric tests at the same times (except the first hour). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated good absorption of GVG with peak plasma concentrations found within the first two hours, dose-dependent areas under the plasma concentration-time curves and about 65 % recovery in the 24 -h urine. Computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG suggested that GVG produces only small changes in the normal CNS, characterized by an augmentation of total power, absolute and relative power of the beta activity and acceleration of the centroid of the total activity. There was also a trend towards an increase of <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> and of the absolute and relative power of the dominant frequency, decrease in the alpha centroid and increase of the centroid of the combined delta and theta activity. Lorazepam 3 mg, in contrast, produced highly significant changes characterized by a decrease of <b>total</b> power, <b>alpha</b> <b>activity,</b> absolute and relative power of the dominant frequency and centroid of the combined delta and theta activity, while beta activity as well as the centroid of the <b>alpha,</b> beta and <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> increased. In the resting condition an additional augmentation of slow activity suggested hypnotic properties of 3 mg lorazepam. The latter changes are typical for anxiolytic sedatives and were also reflected at the behavioral level where psychometric data demonstrated a deterioration in the noo- and thymopsychic parameters and sedative effects in psychophysiological variables.

40|$|Objective. To {{characterize}} {{the patterns of}} alpha electroencephalographic sleep and their associations with pain and sleep in patients with fibromyalgia. Methods. Pain and sleep symptoms of 40 female patients with fibromyalgia and 43 healthy control subjects were studied before and after overnight polysomnography, Blinded analyses of <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in nonrapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep were performed using time domain, frequency domain, and visual analysis techniques. Results. Three distinct patterns of <b>alpha</b> sleep <b>activity</b> were detected in fibromyalgia: phasic alpha (simultaneous with delta activity) in 50 % of patients, tonic alpha (continuous throughout non-REM sleep) in 20 % of patients, and low <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in the remaining 30 % of patients. Low <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> was exhibited by 83. 7 % of control subjects (P < 0. 01). All fibromyalgia patients who displayed phasic <b>alpha</b> sleep, <b>activity</b> reported worsening of pain after sleep, compared with 58. 3 % of patients with low <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (P < 0. 01) and 25. 0 % of patients with tonic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (P < 0. 01). Postsleep {{increase in the number}} of tender points occurred in 90. 0 % of patients with phasic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity,</b> 41. 7 % of patients,vith low <b>alpha</b> <b>activity,</b> and 25. 0 % of patients with tonic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (P < 0. 01). Self ratings of poor deep were reported by all patients with phasic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity,</b> 58. 3 % of patients with low <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (P < 0. 01), and 12. 5 % of patients with tonic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (P < 0. 01). Patients with phasic <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> reported longer duration of pain than patients in other subgroups (P < 0. 01). Additionally, patients with phasic <b>alpha</b> sleep <b>activity</b> exhibited less total sleep time than patients in other subgroups (P < 0. 05), as well as lower sleep efficiency (P < 0. 05) and less slow wave sleep (P < 0. 05) than patients with a tonic alpha sleep pattern.

40|$|Most {{hypotheses}} {{about the origin}} of the occipital alpha rhythm stress the specific influence of ocular activity. In this study, the influence of eye-movement frequency and extreme upward deviation of the eyeballs (enlarging the corneo-retinal potential) on occipital <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> and basal skin resistance is investigated. Eye-movement frequency did not significantly influence <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> and basal skin resistance.

40|$|The role of oscillatory <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (8 - 13 Hz) in {{cognitive}} processing {{remains an open}} question.

Recent electroencephalography (EEG) {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> increases parametrically with load during retention in working memory paradigms. While it is known that the parieto-occipital cortex is involved in the generation of the spontaneous alpha oscillations, it remains unknown where the sources of the memory-dependent <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> are located.

The results obtained revealed that, in most samples, gross alpha and gross beta were lower than the parameter value indicated in the international regulations. An attempt was also made to find a correlation between these results and the chemical parameters of waters. The results indicate, as expected, a good correlation between gross beta activity and 40 K concentration. In all samples uranium isotopes represent the principal radioactivity source.

It decreased within and across REM sleep episodes. Selective REM sleep deprivation resulted in a reduction of <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in the REM sleep EEG. However, the topographical distribution and the time course were not affected. It is suggested that <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in the REM sleep EEG is a marker of REM sleep homeostasis...|$|R
