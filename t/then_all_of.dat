5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} every Winter Paralympics since the inaugural games in 1976. Their sole {{participant}} in 1976 was Ron Finneran, {{although he was}} not an official entrant. In 1980, alpine and cross-country skier Kyrra Grunnsund and cross-country skier Peter Rickards became the first official competitors for Australia. The number of Australian athletes increased to three, five, five and six at the next four games, respectively, and all of the athletes were alpine skiers. The participation decreased to four in 1998 and climbed back up to six in 2002. Australia won its first Winter Paralympic medals in 1992, and has medalled at every games since <b>then.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> the medals have been won in alpine skiing.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, one with low and one with high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. <b>Then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

The event is scored not by time but {{by the number of}} solved cubes minus the number of unsolved cubes after one hour has elapsed.|$|E
25|$|Chern–Simons {{theories}} {{are related to}} many other field theories. For example, if one considers a Chern–Simons theory with gauge group G on a manifold with boundary <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the 3-dimensional propagating degrees of freedom may be gauged away, leaving a 2-dimensional conformal field theory known as a G Wess–Zumino–Witten model on the boundary. In addition the U(N) and SO(N) Chern–Simons theories at large N are well approximated by matrix models.|$|E

Following the Arab capture of the Old City of Jerusalem in October 1938, the army effectively took over Jerusalem and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Palestine.|$|E

Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|After viewing a question, the {{contestant}} {{can leave}} the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer. If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their winnings are lost, except that the £1,000 and £32,000 prizes are guaranteed: if a player gets a question wrong above these levels, then the prize drops to the previous guaranteed prize. Answering the £2,000 and £64,000 questions wrong does not reduce the prize money. The prizes are generally non-cumulative; that is, answering a question correctly does not result in the amount being played for being added to the amount already won, rather the amount already won is written off and replaced by a larger sum, usually twice as large. The game ends when the contestant answers a question incorrectly, decides not to answer a question, or answers all questions correctly.|$|E
25|$|Each contest has its {{own rules}} {{regarding}} content and contestant judging/scoring. In the International Speech Contest, the contestant selects the subject and type of speech to give, and the speech is judged on the overall presentation using a point system for various categories of skills. In a Humorous Speech Contest the speeches are judged using {{a different set of}} categories, which include how well humor was used. In a Tall Tales Contest, judging is based on speaking skills and use of exaggeration for humorous effect. In an Evaluation Contest (2–3 minutes with 30 seconds overtime grace period), a test speaker gives a speech, and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the contestants leave the room, returning one at a time to evaluate the same speech. In the Table Topics Contest (1–2 minutes with 30 seconds overtime grace period), contestants are led into the room one at a time and presented with a topic they have not previously been informed of and are judged on how well they respond; each contestant is given the same topic.|$|E

500|$|The two studios made a {{trade-off}} in March 1999; Columbia relinquished its rights {{to create a}} new 007 series in exchange for MGM's giving up its claim to Spider-Man. Columbia acquired the rights to all previous scripts in 2000, but exercised options only on the [...] "Cameron Material", i.e., both the completed multi-author screenplay and the subsequent [...] "scriptment." [...] After {{more than a decade of}} attempts, Spider-Man truly went into production and since <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Spider-Man films were distributed by Columbia Pictures, the primary film production holding of Sony.

500|$|Two or more {{consecutive}} axles may {{not exceed}} the weight computed by the bridge formula, even if the gross weight of the truck (or the weight on one axle) is below otherwise legal limits. Although this means that any two axles must comply with the formula, experience has shown that axles 1 through 3, 1 through 5, and 2 through 5 are critical and must be checked. This means that the axle group which comprises the entire truck (known as the [...] "outer group") and the interior axle groups (known as the [...] "tractor group" [...] and [...] "trailer group") must also comply with the bridge formula. If these combinations {{are found to be}} satisfactory, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the other axle groups on this type of vehicle will usually be satisfactory.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked.

[...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's going to go away, and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, [...] "I think there's a little self-examination in those songs, {{something}} {{that a lot of}} my friends are going through too, as they approach 30." [...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together. Vedder has said that he wrote the song [...] "Off He Goes" [...] about himself and how he is a [...] "shit friend," [...] adding, [...] "I'll show up and everything's great and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the sudden I'm outta there..." [...] "Lukin" [...] is about the [...] "pretty intense stalker problem," [...] Vedder faced during the mid-1990s.

500|$|Co-executive {{producer}} David Munk {{said that}} {{the idea for the}} record started after his suggestion that Cole [...] "return to her R roots by recording an intimate, classic soul CD {{with a small group of}} sidemen and simple production". Munk served as an executive producer for the album. He viewed the recording sessions in Atlanta as eclectic and described Cole's ambition: [...] "he shared with me her hope of making a country-soul record in Memphis; she also spoke of doing a piano-voice album and of recording in Spanish". In an interview with American Songwriter, Cole said the album [...] "was born out of desperation" [...] to record a pop and urban project rather than a jazz one. She sought to avoid being typecast as a jazz singer by returning to R and demanding more artistic control. As an arranger on the album, she said the recording sessions reminded her of how she: [...] "missed the freedom ... ad-libbing, you know, and being able to holler every now and <b>then</b> ... <b>all</b> <b>of</b> that energy".|$|E
