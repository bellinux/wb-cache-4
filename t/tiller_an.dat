5000|$|Three-dimensional art using a {{still image}} is {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} following: computer-generated imagery (which can be used to create sculptural art, as in 3D printing); trompe l’oeil, also known as [...] "fool the eye" [...] street art (sometimes executed in chalk); or stereo-optic visuals that require special glasses with a double image. Distinctive from the above types of 3D work, Ken Gidge, developed a new form of three-dimensional art: an abstract fine art treatment referred to as [...] "Gidge 3D Spectral Illusions", which gives the viewer the impression that shapes on the flat surface of the painting are projecting outward, floating in space or receding into the surface. The viewer needs to look through special 3D glasses that have bifocal vision for the optical illusion to be perceived. This treatment was first shown at the Chimera Gallery in Nashua, NH by Nancy Ferrier on October 29, 2011. David <b>Tiller,</b> <b>an</b> early collector of Gidge 3D art is credited for describing the work as “Spectral Illusions".|$|E
