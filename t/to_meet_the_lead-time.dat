A uniform <b>lead-time,</b> which is <b>the</b> maximum time span a customer has to wait before receiving the required service, is quoted to all customers. We present quadratic integer programming {{model for the}} problem of scheduling jobs <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> promised <b>lead-time</b> with objective of workload balancing across time. Since in practice, solving such a problem to optimality can be very dicult, two variants of a variable neighborhood search heuristic are proposed. Extensive computational tests show that our approaches are able to provide high quality solutions efficiently...|$|R
