In {{relativistic}} transformation the bremsstrahlung trajectories are forward-leaning, moving along the e-beam; if the X-ray fluence is {{collected from the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>target</b> in the forward direction and integrated over the azimuth angles, fluence could be several-hundredfold enhanced compared with the Coolidge tube. The e-beam range in an X-ray target {{is only a few}} micrometres; for a 30 μm thick transmission X-ray target, most of the target thickness would absorb low-energy photons and transfer high-energy photons into the fluorescent K- or L-lines characteristic of the target element. Monochromatic line emissions are emitted from the refined X-ray focal point.

One of the promising mass spectrometry imaging techniques that may be used to accomplish this is Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), using MeV energy heavy ions for excitation. MeV ions have the ability to desorb large intact molecules with a yield that is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional SIMS using keV ions. In order to increase the spatial resolution of the MeV TOF-SIMS system, we propose an independent TOF trigger using a STIM (scanning transmission ion microscopy) detector that is placed just behind the thin <b>transmission</b> <b>target.</b> This arrangement is suitable for biological samples in which the STIM detector simultaneously measures the mass distribution in scanned samples.

By optimization and application of our Industrial High Resolution Micro Computer Tomograph (microCT, Fraunhofer IZFP), we achieve an image quality known so far only from synchrotron X-ray tomography. To improve the generation of X-ray photons, the micro focus X-ray tube was equipped with a high performance <b>transmission</b> <b>target</b> with diamond carrier to achieve a higher photon flux at the same focal diameter. Additionally, our new alignment tool allows post-acquisition correction of adjustment incorrectness which {{plays a key role}} in reconstruction of high resolution microCT-data. However, an accurate segmentation of the cochlea is still problematic due to the low X-ray absorption contrast of the inner membranes of scalae.

40|$|Structural {{investigation}} and characterization of objects below the micrometer-scale level often require either big efforts in experimental setup and critical time schedules {{as is the}} case with synchrotron sources or a big effort in test object preparation including destructive methods (e. g. grinding) for the investigation within an electron microscope. The limiting factor for high-resolution imaging with conventional X-ray sources is the focal spot size of the X-ray tube used. Focal spot sizes down to 500 nm can be achieved with double-focusing X-ray tubes and transmission targets. To be able to use X-ray transmission imaging for structural investigation with highest resolution in everybody's laboratory, we modified an electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) to be used as an X-ray source. With this it is possible to obtain electron beam diameters below 200 nm and to produce X-rays using a special <b>transmission</b> <b>target.</b> Due to the low X-ray intensity and in order to profit from the high magnification, a high- resolution, low-noise detector is to be used.

40|$|Recently, we {{demonstrated}} that projective X-ray microscopy is feasible with a twodimensional spatial resolution down to 100 nm by using laboratory nanofocus X-ray sources and a geometric magnification {{of up to}} 1000 x. Based on these previous results, we developed a high-resolution X-ray laminography system which uses an optimized thin-film X-ray <b>transmission</b> <b>target</b> together with a modified electron probe micro analyzer. Unlike conventional axial computed tomography (CT), 3 D laminography imaging involves a linear translation of both detector and object {{with respect to a}} stationary point source. In this contribution we present a detailed characterization of the setup concerning especially the laminographic imaging mode. The quality of the volume reconstruction is assessed by simulating an ideal setup with an analytical model including features down to 200 nm which are resolved in the setup given a high enough SNR in the projections. We further address the issue of a drop in the detector resolution under oblique X-ray illumination which is a common problem to such systems. The finite penetration depth of the X-rays into the detector pixels causes an anisotropic blurring of the detector point spread function (PSF) under oblique irradiation. We tested the influence of this blurring by calculating the illuminationdependent modulation transfer function (MTF) of the detector. Our measurements are supported by numerical simulations of the detector MTF. Both simulations and measurements show a drop in spatial resolution (20 % of the MTF) from 12. 5 lp/mm (irradiation perpendicular to the detector screen) down to 5. 2 lp/mm (irradiation 30 degrees oblique to the screen).

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} WDXRFS {{analysis}} of {{rare earth element}} (REE) compounds and monazite, a radioactive phosphate mineral with very variable composition and high concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) and thorium. The evaluation considers the use of K or L series REE, Nb and Y lines, L or M series lines for Th, U and Pb, and K series lines for common major elements. It is shown that {{the selection of the}} K or L line series for the REEs will determine whether powder briquettes (K series) or fusion disks (L series) must be used. For the light REEs (La through Gd) a Au target tube operated at 100 kV will give the best results, while a Au tube operated at 60 kV 45 mA will give the best results for all of the L series lines. It is suggested that a light REE, determined with the Ka line, {{could be used as a}} variable internal standard for the heavy REEs (L series lines), and thus solve particle size and mineralogical problems in powder briquettes. Since most users have only a single x-ray tube, Rh target, which is the third best tube for REE K lines and the fourth best for REE L lines, it is suggested that instrument suppliers consider the possibility of providing a Ge secondary <b>transmission</b> <b>target</b> on the tube filter support. This could increase considerably the excitation efficiency of the REE L lines, since GeKcl is ideally placed just short of the REE L series absorption edges. Problems of infinite thickness, mineralogical and particle size effects, spectral line overlap, crossing of major element absorption edges, lack of suitable of standards and lack of influence coefficient software to handle up to 32 elements in a single run are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The natural {{function}} of dendritic cells (DCs) is {{to capture and}} degrade pathogens for Ag presentation. However, HIV- 1 can evade viral degradation by DCs and hijack DCs for migration to susceptible CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes. It is unknown what factors decide whether a virus is degraded or transmitted to T cells. The interaction of DCs with HIV- 1 involves C-type lectin receptors, such as DC-specific ICAM- 3 -grabbing nonintegrin, which bind to the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env), which is decorated heavily with N-linked glycans. We hypothesized that the saccharide composition of the Env N-glycans is involved in avoiding viral degradation and Ag presentation, as well as preserving infectious virus for the <b>transmission</b> to <b>target</b> cells. Therefore, we studied the fate of normally glycosylated virus versus oligomannose-enriched virus in DCs. Changing the heterogeneous N-linked glycan composition of Env to uniform oligomannose N-glycans increased the affinity of HIV- 1 for DC-specific ICAM- 3 -grabbing nonintegrin and enhanced the capture of HIV- 1 by immature DCs; however, it decreased the subsequent <b>transmission</b> to <b>target</b> cells. Oligomannose-enriched HIV- 1 was directed more efficiently into the endocytic pathway, resulting in enhanced viral degradation and reduced virus transfer to target cells. Furthermore, Env containing exclusively oligomannose N-glycans was presented to Env-specific CD 4 (+) T cells more efficiently. Taken together, our {{results showed that the}} HIV- 1 N-glycan composition plays {{a crucial role in the}} balance between DC-mediated Ag degradation and presentation and DC-mediated virus <b>transmission</b> to <b>target</b> cells.
