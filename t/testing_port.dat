40|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaboration}} between Durham University and ESO, an experimental platform is presented whose purpose is for testing generic laser-based wavefront sensors (WFS) for adaptive optics. The Rayleigh Technical Demonstrator (RTD) {{has been designed to}} allow a laser launch and Rayleigh back-scatter collection by installing components solely on a Nasmyth platform of the William Herschel Telescope, La Palma. The aim is to provide a WFS <b>testing</b> <b>port</b> within the RTD, permitting new WFS concepts to be tested rapidly in conjunction. This means that the RTD only requires small modifications for each concept to be tested. The second goal is to permit near-contemporaneous comparison of WFS data with that from a tomographic WFS. Currently, the RTD is planned to trial with three “cone effect-free ” WFS concepts as part of the CALDO project. Presented here is an overview of the RTD design with detailed information on novel components and design choices...|$|E
50|$|The {{receivers}} {{make the}} measurements. A network analyzer {{will have one}} or more receivers connected to its <b>test</b> <b>ports.</b> The reference <b>test</b> <b>port</b> is usually labeled R, and the primary <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> are A, B, C,.... Some analyzers will dedicate a separate receiver to each <b>test</b> <b>port,</b> but others share one or two receivers among the ports. The R receiver may be less sensitive than the receivers used on the <b>test</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>test</b> <b>port</b> {{designed}} {{as part of}} a fiber optic coupled laser altimeter receiver optical system allows for the back-illumination of the optical system for alignment verification, as well as illumination of the detector(s) for testing the receiver electronics and signal-processing algorithms. Measuring the optical alignment of a laser altimeter instrument is difficult after the instrument is fully assembled. The addition of a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> in the receiver aft-optics allows for the back-illumination of the receiver system such that its focal setting and boresight alignment can be easily verified. For a multiple-detector receiver system, the addition of the aft-optics <b>test</b> <b>port</b> offers the added advantage of being able to simultaneously test all the detectors with different signals that simulate the expected operational conditions. On a laser altimeter instrument (see figure), the aft-optics couple the light from the receiver telescope to the receiver detector(s). Incorporating a beam splitter in the aft-optics design allows for the addition of a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> to back-illuminate the receiver telescope and/or detectors. The aft-optics layout resembles a T with the detector on one leg, the receiver telescope input port on the second leg, and the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> on the third leg. The use of a custom beam splitter with 99 -percent reflection, 1 -percent transmission, and a mirrored roof can send the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> light to the receiver telescope leg as well as the detector leg, without unduly sacrificing the signal from the receiver telescope to the detector. The ability to test the receiver system alignment, as well as multiple detectors with different signals without the need to disassemble the instrument or connect and reconnect components, is a great advantage to the aft-optics <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> Another benefit is that the receiver telescope aperture is fully back-illuminated by the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> so the receiver telescope focal setting vs. pressure and or temperature can be accurately measured (as compared to schemes where the aperture is only partially illuminated). Fiber-optic coupling the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> also allows for the modularity of testing the receiver detectors with a variety of background and signal laser sources without the need of using complex optical set-ups to optimize the efficiency of each source...|$|R
50|$|For the SNA, the {{receiver}} only measures {{the magnitude of}} the signal. A receiver can be a detector diode that operates at the test frequency. The simplest SNA will have a single <b>test</b> <b>port,</b> but more accurate measurements are made when a reference port is also used. The reference port will compensate for amplitude variations in the test signal at the measurement plane. It is possible to share a single detector and use it for both the reference <b>port</b> and the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> by making two measurement passes.|$|R

5000|$|SOLT : {{which is}} an acronym for Short, Open, Load, Thru, is the {{simplest}} method. As the name suggests, this requires access to known standards with a short circuit, open circuit, a precision load (usually 50 ohms) and a through connection. It is best if the <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> have {{the same type of}} connector (N, 3,5 mm etc.), but of a different sex, so the through just requires the <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> are connected together. SOLT is suitable for coaxial measurements, where it is possible to obtain the short, open, load and through. The SOLT calibration method is less suitable for waveguide measurements, where it is difficult to obtain an open circuit or a load, or for measurements on non-coaxial test fixtures, where the same problems with finding suitable standards exist.|$|R

5000|$|TRL(through-reflect-line calibration): This {{technique}} {{is useful for}} microwave, noncoaxial environments such as fixture, wafer probing, or waveguide. TRL uses a transmission line, significantly longer in electrical length than the through line, of known length and impedance as one standard. TRL also requires a high-reflection standard (usually, a short or open) whose impedance {{does not have to}} be well characterized, but it must be electrically the same for both <b>test</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R

40|$|Compounds {{from the}} odour-producing glands of the fox Vulpes vulpes were collected. This complex mixture of {{compounds}} {{was used to}} stimulate the 'ascoid' olfactory organs of female sandflies in single sensillum and gas chromatography-linked single sensillum recordings. Sixteen of these compounds were identified using gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry and amounts present were determined. The compounds fell into four organic classes: ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols and aldehydes. Specific neurones present in the ascoid sensillum that responded {{to each of these}} classes of compound were characterized. A bioassay chamber was developed that gave female sandflies the choice of two odour sources. Female sandflies were attracted upwind by fox odour and were trapped in closer proximity to the fox odour port than the control port. Synthetic compounds were recombined in appropriate quantities to mimic the fox odour. In this bioassay, the synthetic blend attracted sandflies upwind, and again they were caught closer to the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> than the control port. Furthermore, the synthetic fox odour induced an electrophysiological response from neurones in the ascoid sensillum that was very similar to that induced by natural fox odour. No synthetic compound alone induced the same behavioural response from sandflies as did whole fox odour. However, benzaldehyde, 4 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone and 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone alone did cause sandflies to fly upwind and to be caught closer to the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> than the control...|$|R

The Miniature Machining Group at Sandia National Laboratories applied a technique called Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) to quickly and economically machine these devices without disassembly. In so doing, they facilitated the use of existing components without the need to purchase new devices. The technique also improves an uncertainty of calibration known as Mismatch Uncertainty by optimizing the reflection coefficient of the calibration <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> This effects a reduction in overall calibration uncertainties...|$|R

This switch normally will operate a circuit breaker to isolate the apparatus before the fault causes additional damage. Buchholz relays have a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> to allow the accumulated gas to be withdrawn for testing. Flammable gas found in the relay indicates some internal fault such as overheating or arcing, whereas air found in the relay may only indicate low oil level or a leak.|$|R
5000|$|Latency: {{measures}} the round-trip time {{taken by a}} test frame to travel through a network device or across the network {{and back to the}} <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> Latency is the time interval that begins when the last bit of the input frame reaches the input port and ends when the first bit of the output frame is seen on the output port. It is the time taken by a bit to go through the network and back. Latency variability can be a problem. With protocols like voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), a variable or long latency can cause degradation in voice quality.|$|R

Such parallel branches are found e. g. in amplifiers with corporate combiners and push-pull oscillators. The device may be switched between two states, a symmetry and an antisymmetry state. The former is used in normal or even-mode operation and reduces the paralleled branches to a single branch, thus scaling down the time needed for the circuit setup {{as much as the}} simulation time.

50|$|To {{test the}} control plane IP load testers {{typically}} emulate various protocols via the <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> {{in order to}} connect to the real implementations of those protocols on the router itself. For example, within {{the core of the}} Internet, various routing protocols are used for the control plane, or routing function of routers. Core routing protocols include BGP, IS-IS, OSPF, and RIP. Control plane performance is usually characterized by measurements of scalability and performance. Scalability typically means how many protocol sessions can be handled by the router at one time, and ultimately is a stress of memory. Performance usually refers to a time-varying parameter, such as sessions per second, and ultimately is a stress of CPU power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—FPGA-based {{reconfigurable}} systems {{allow the}} online adaptation to dynamically changing runtime requirements. The reliability of FPGAs, being manufactured in latest technologies, {{is threatened by}} soft errors, as well as aging effects and latent defects. To ensure reliable reconfiguration, it is mandatory to guarantee the correct operation of the reconfigurable fabric. This {{can be achieved by}} periodic or on-demand online testing. This paper presents a reliable system architecture for runtime-reconfigurable systems, which integrates two non-concurrent online test strategies: Pre-configuration online tests (PRET) and post-configuration online <b>tests</b> (<b>PORT).</b> The PRET checks that the reconfigurable hardware is free of faults by periodic or on-demand <b>tests.</b> The <b>PORT</b> has two objectives: It tests reconfigured hardware units after reconfiguration to check that the configuration process completed correctly and it validates the expected functionality. During operation, PORT is used to periodically check the reconfigured hardware units for malfunctions in the programmable logic. Altogether, this paper presents PRET, PORT, and the system integration of such test schemes into a runtime-reconfigurable system, including the resource management and test scheduling. Experimental results show that the integration of online testing in reconfigurable systems incurs only minimum impact on performance while delivering high fault coverage and low test latency...|$|R
