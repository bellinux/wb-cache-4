A copy of the amulet was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as its silver content dated to the 19th century or later.|$|E

5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics.

Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|Forbes has {{reported}} Adams <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> highest-paid actresses in the world, with earnings of over $13 million in 2014 and 2016, and over $11 million in 2017.

Also that year, she was {{named one of the}} 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine. Adams received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017. As of 2017, Adams' films have grossed over $4.25 billion worldwide. Even so, Robert Ito of The New York Times believes that Adams' propensity for risky projects prevents her from being a bigger box-office draw.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general manager Bob Watson with Brian Cashman. The club made many player acquisitions, gaining {{the services of}} third baseman Scott Brosius, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández. The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games—a stretch that concluded with a perfect game pitched by Wells—and by August were 76–27. The 1998 Yankees are considered by some writers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> greatest teams in baseball history, having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers and Indians, New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive World Series games for their 24th Series title.|$|E

5|$|Indianapolis' defense {{ranked second}} in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who {{recorded}} 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.|$|E

5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, but overall have gauged it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the northern wobbegong (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement {{and the formation of}} coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, Nevinson {{travelled}} to the United States of America, where he painted a number of powerful images of New York. However, his boasting and exaggerated claims of his war experiences, together with his depressive and temperamental personality, made him many enemies in both the USA and Britain. In 1920, the critic Charles Lewis Hind wrote of Nevinson that 'It is something, at the age of thirty one, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> most discussed, most successful, most promising, most admired and most hated British artists.' His post-war career, however, was not so distinguished. Nevinson's 1937 memoir Paint and Prejudice, although lively and colourful, is in parts inaccurate, inconsistent, and misleading.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
