Some are applicable to the short run, others to the long run.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a history}} of fishery {{mismanagement}} ever since the industrial revolution. Industrial fishing began during the late 1800s where steam-powered trawlers operated in Western Europe. Local fisherman noticed that fish populations were being systematically wiped out. Half the fishing fleet in the world was sunk in WW2 and the opportunity to manage fisheries then was lost. Afterwards, scientific and mathematical models were developed to better understand fish. However, these were not taken seriously. For example, maximum sustainable yield, <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> <b>point</b> between sustainable population size and the fishing intensity, is currently discredited because of the inability to accurately measure fish quantities. However, it is still the objective of several international fishing conventions.|$|E
50|$|In PBB and PBT {{switches}} at {{the edge}} of the carrier network encapsulate customer traffic within an 802.1ah frame. The carrier network core is only responsible for transporting frames from an edge device to another, alleviating Q-in-Q’s issue of forwarding table scalability. The same feature - assigning a MAC address per edge device, not per service - creates a scalability issue for multipoint services. Multipoint services require full mesh connectivity between edge devices, a very inefficient method as all frames are duplicated at the root nodes, rather than at <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> <b>point</b> as in VLAN connectivity. Moreover, the need to create forwarding entries for each unicast connection within the full mesh (as opposed to a single VLAN forwarding tree in the case of VLAN connectivity) will quickly become unsustainable as multipoint services become predominant in the near future.|$|E

They examine {{the proposition that}} in order to reach <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> <b>point</b> of allocating resources, prices that deviate from marginal cost are required. They recognize that with every tax, there is some sort of price distortion, so they state that any solution can only be the second-best option and any solution proposed is under that added constraint. However, their theory differs from other literature in this topic. First, it deals with quasi-optimal pricing, looking at four options for Pareto optimality with adjusted commodity prices. Second, they express their theory in more simplified terms which incurs a loss of realistic application. Third, it combines the three discussions: the welfare theory, the contributions of the regulations and public finance. They conclude that under constraints, the best possible theory to get close to optimality, which is not “best” at all, is the systematic division between prices and marginal costs.|$|E
