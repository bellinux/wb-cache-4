5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> owned the manor {{in what was}} then an {{isolated}} rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II. The organization participants gathered at the Flatbush Post of the American Legion on Nostrand Ave at 9 AM to get their instructions from Hoch. He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars. Many were not able to get to see the displays that day and planned on viewing the next day when the train would stop a few miles away at Jamaica, Queens, New York.|$|E

25|$|The Minnesota River {{valley and}} {{surrounding}} upland prairie areas were abandoned by most settlers during the war. Many of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> fled their farms and homes as refugees never returned. Following the American Civil War, however, {{the area was}} resettled. By the mid-1870s, it was again being used for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|These residences {{differ from}} the {{traditional}} Ottoman mansions (konak) in the city {{by a number of}} features, as well as by their history. <b>The</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> owned them, the notable visitors they hosted in these houses, their testimonial destinies through the historic events of the city, make them an important part of Smyrna' common heritage.|$|E
25|$|Studies by the Urban Institute and the US Treasury {{have both}} found {{that about half}} of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> start in either the top or the bottom {{quintile}} of the income distribution are still there after a decade, and that only 3 to 6% rise from bottom to top or fall from top to bottom.|$|E

25|$|Although {{this was}} not a happy result for Brogdens, the results for New Zealand and the {{families}} themselves were good. New Zealand obtained useful citizens who were very happy with their work, wages, food and social conditions. Their letters home encouraged more people to come. Many of today's New Zealanders have ancestors who were members of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> emigrated at this time.|$|E
25|$|The {{land will}} mourn {{each of the}} {{families}} by itself: {{the family of the}} house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself and their wives by themselves; and all <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> remain, each of the families by itself and their wives by themselves. Zechariah 12:12-14.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor was}} the {{solidarity}} shown by <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> {{refused to be}} separated. This desire undermined individual initiatives. Some older Jews also had difficulty remaining in hiding because of their {{lack of knowledge of}} the Greek language, which had only become the city's dominant language after annexation by Greece in 1913. Additionally, the large size of the Jewish population rendered impossible the tactic of blending into the Greek Orthodox population, as in Athens.|$|E

25|$|While Clark and his {{officers}} drilled {{the troops in}} preparation for the Kaskaskia expedition, <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> had traveled with the regiment down the Ohio River settled on the island and planted a corn crop. These settlers moved to the mainland the following year, founding the settlement which became Louisville. While on the island, Clark received an important message from Pittsburgh: France had signed a Treaty of Alliance with the United States. Clark hoped that this information would be useful in securing the allegiance of the Canadien inhabitants of the Illinois country.|$|E
25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> {{settled in}} Puerto Rico were the Beauchamps. Francois Joseph Beauchamp Menier, from St. Nazaire, France, {{was a member}} of the French Army {{stationed}} in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) with his family during the slave revolution. When the French ranks were disbanded he boarded a ship bound for Martinique, together with his wife Elizabeth Sterling and children. The boat however ran ashore in Puerto Rico instead of reaching Martinique. The Spanish government offered Beauchamp Menier land to cultivate and the family settled in the town of Añasco.|$|E

25|$|Coleridge at {{this time}} envisioned the {{community}} including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier {{members of the community}} making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members. Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the {{government}} announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided {{to ask for a}} new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on 6 October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on 5 April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> opted for arbitration rather than litigation.|$|E
500|$|Banksy's op-ed {{article about}} One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as {{an insult to}} many across the city. Former FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "disgrace to New York City and all <b>the</b> <b>{{families}}</b> <b>who</b> lost loved ones on 9/11." [...] Sally Regenhard, a leading voice for families of 11 September victims, expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was [...] "horrific" [...] and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion. A Century 21 department store near Ground Zero had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of estate houses led to greater privacy, comfort and luxury for <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> lived in them. Interiors were remodelled, with broader staircases, family rooms were added and heating was improved. Oriel windows gave better views, more light {{and could be}} opened for fresh air. After the Reformation, which virtually ended religious patronage of art in Scotland, craftsmen and artists turned to secular patrons. With {{the departure of the}} Scottish court for England in 1603, Jenny Wormald argues that there was a shift [...] "from court to castle" [...] in patronage and creativity; estate houses became repositories of art and elaborate furnishings that illustrated the wealth and taste of their occupants.|$|E
500|$|Beatles biographer Bob Spitz {{described}} Starkey's upbringing as [...] "a Dickensian {{chronicle of}} misfortune". Houses {{in the area}} were [...] "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse." [...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> lived in the Dingle, {{he was part of}} an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: [...] "You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 2012, an Afghan {{parliamentary}} probe {{team made}} up of {{several members of the}} National Assembly of Afghanistan announced that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings, with support from two helicopters. [...] They had spent two days in the province on site, interviewing the survivors and collecting evidence. [...] One {{of the members of the}} probe team, Hamizai Lali, said: [...] "We closely examined the site of the incident, talked to <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>who</b> lost their beloved ones, the injured people and tribal elders... The villages are one and a half kilometer from the U.S. military base. We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour... have been killed by the two groups." [...] Lali asked the Afghan government, the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan. [...] While visiting one of the affected villages, Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said: [...] "In his family, in four rooms people were killed – children and women were killed – and then they were all brought together in one room and then set on fire. That, one man cannot do." [...] However, the team later said they could not confirm that multiple soldiers took part in the killings.|$|E
