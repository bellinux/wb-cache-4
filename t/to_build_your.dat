You can send a man to brush them off every day, rather than having to access everyone's buildings individually, and you can make sure that they are running at their absolute peak. It's much better than putting them on every building in the city." ...|$|E

[...] In order to automate these processes, connectors {{are needed to}} fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A Process Driven Messaging Service is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a Process Driven Messaging Platform. Process Driven Messaging Service gives you the logic <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>your</b> process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.|$|E
