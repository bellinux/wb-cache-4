30|$|Consider a {{processor}} organization {{consisting of a}} number of client modules and server modules (jointly called devices), like memory units and arithmetic-logic processing units. Suppose that these devices are interconnected with a bus which is segmented {{in such a way that}} devices connected to a particular segment can communicate in parallel to the data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> going on in the other segments. This is achieved by a control logic which is able to reserve a continuous subsequence of the segments necessary to establish a path from the source to the target device. Given the frequency of data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> between the devices, our task is to determine an efficient segmentation and segment-to-device assignment of this on-chip architecture. This task is formulated as an optimization problem which considers the amount of data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> performed via the bus segments. The problem turns out to be NP hard but we propose efficient local search-based heuristics for it. The heuristics are applied to sample cases, and the outcome is an improved performance in terms of a shorter execution time.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} such <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> ever {{conducted}} at sea. The success of this rescue avoided a serious setback for the LNG industry. LNG, if spilled disperses rapidly and is a non-toxic liquid, however the extreme cold of LNG can present hazards until the liquid returns to a gaseous state. In its gaseous state, the vapor is in essence a form of methane and quickly absorbs into the air.|$|E

The peristaltic CCD has an additional implant that keeps the charge away from the silicon/silicon dioxide interface and generates a large lateral electric field from one gate to the next. This provides an additional driving force to aid in transfer of the charge packets.|$|E
