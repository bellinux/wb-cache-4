5|$|Zieliński {{left the}} company, and Kiciński headed the project. Although the game's {{development}} continued, the demo was abandoned. According to CD Projekt, the development team had different {{ideas for the}} game and lacked overall direction; as a result, it was returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> in 2003. The team, unfamiliar with video-game development, spent nearly two years organising production. They received assistance from BioWare, who helped promote the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo by offering CD Projekt space in their booth next to Jade Empire. BioWare also licensed their Aurora game engine to the company.|$|E

50|$|Bob Osborn {{founded a}} slick {{quarterly}} magazine devoted solely to freestyle BMX. In {{the summer of}} 1984, Freestylin' Magazine made its debut. The BMX world suddenly noticed the sport's massive potential. Manufacturers hurried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> develop new freestyle bikes, components, and accessories, and began searching for talented riders to sponsor.

50|$|However, the {{proposed}} redevelopment project {{was sent back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>boards</b> in April 2010 when the California Coastal Commission rejected it. A major issue was the disappearance from the plan of an originally proposed 79000 sq ft grassy park. In the plan rejected by the Coastal Commission, the park {{had been replaced by}} a smaller, hardscape plaza. The Port will now amend its master plan and resubmit its proposal for Coastal Commission approval - a process that can take several years.|$|R
25|$|After beating Williams twice by {{decision}}, he met Robinson with Robinson's world Welterweight title on the line.

Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> he beat Rocky Castellani, the then lightweight world champion Beau Jack, and Laurent Dauthuille (the latter of whom fought Gavilan in Montreal, Canada). All of them were beaten by decision in ten. In 1950, he went 10-4-1, beating Billy Graham, Sonny Horne, Robert Villemain, Eugene Hairston, and Tony Janiro among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{designers}} {{then went}} back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> and the aircraft emerged as the larger Type 700 with up to 48 passengers (53 in some configurations), and a cruising speed of 308mph (496km/h). The new prototype G-AMAV first flew from Brooklands on 28 August 1950, {{and served as a}} development aircraft for the type for several years. In late August 1950, BEA placed an order for 20 aircraft; further orders would come in the following year from operators such as Air France, Aer Lingus and Misrair. In 1953, the basic cost given for a Viscount was £235,000.|$|E

On May 11, 2012, UFC Primetime returned to promote the fight between Mir and dos Santos, and concluded on May 25. In their fight, Dos Santos {{was able to use}} superior foot work to strike in and out before Mir could mount any significant offense.

5000|$|The 935/77 {{body style}} was used also {{for a single}} purpose car: winning one race in the small 2.0 litre Div. II of <b>the</b> DRM, <b>to</b> prove that Porsche could win there, too. In Div. I, the {{customer}} 935s raced each other, and German TV announced that at the Norisring, it would thus cover only the Div. II race.

25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was through the top – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time he went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

500|$|Pre-production of {{the game}} began in 2007. Electronic Arts {{approached}} Starbreeze Studios to revive the franchise because Electronic Arts {{was impressed with the}} quality of Starbreeze Studios' [...] previous games and believed they could add [...] "style" [...] to the series. The game was returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> after a year of development, and the co-operative multiplayer mode was added to the main game. The development team hoped the game would appeal to both newcomers and players of the original game; they maintained the theme of the original and drastically changed the gameplay. Richard K. Morgan was hired to write the story for the game.|$|E

500|$|Vicious Cycle {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> and {{produced}} a new concept that they felt was darker and better suited to an older audience.

500|$|Following the {{successful}} tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable. [...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable. [...] The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.|$|E
500|$|Going back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> Raindancer {{reformed}} as three-piece {{band called}} 'Reel' after John Canham departed. Their bass player Simon Blight later {{departed from the}} band and the music business, before changing their name to 'Real'. During this time in 1994 they recruited Taka Hirose via an advert in Loot, which Taka placed himself. The band then changed their name to Feeder, named after Grant's pet goldfish. They won their recording contract with Echo after sending a demo tape, and then completed the deal after an employee from the label witnessed one of the band's gigs. A track called [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", which featured on the demo appeared as a b-side on the [...] "Day In Day Out" [...] single, albeit a different version to the demo recording. After signing with The Echo Label in 1994, the group toured with Scarborough band B.l.o.w. who at the time, recently formed {{from the ashes of}} Little Angels.

In spite of a powerful turbojet, it could not rise more than four or five feet off the ground, i.e., out of ground effect. Thus, the Avrocar {{could be seen as}} a prototype for the early generations of hovercraft, lacking only a 'skirt' to make it a truly effective example of the type.
