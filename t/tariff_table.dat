40|$|Thailand imports a {{large volume}} of table grapes from the United States of America. The Thai – U. S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will reduce tariff on imports and thus import value changes which will affect related sectors of Thai economy system. The {{objectives}} {{of this study are}} to estimate trend of importing quantity and value of table grapes from the U. S. caused by the reduction of import tariff under the FTA, and to evaluate the impact of the tariff reduction on related sectors of the Thai economy. The result found that the relative price of grape and real capita income elasticities of demand are - 1. 1 and 4. 7, respectively. The relative price was expected to decrease while the real capita income increases. This would raise the import value and lead to the accumulation of 19, 520. 4 million baht from 2007 to 2017. The sectors related to the fruit orchard sector as an intermediate input users were least affected by 13. 62 million baht decrease of the economic value. In contrast, the intermediate input sectors would be most affected by 6, 587. 80 million baht decrease of the economic value. These sectors were agricultural services sector, fertilizer, pesticide and insecticide sector, wholesale trade sector, basic chemicals sector, banking service sector, cutlery and hand tools sector, petroleum refinery gas separated plant sector, retail trade sector, and plastic wares sector. The government and related organizations should develop measures to reduce the impacts that may occur.

50|$|On 31 October 2011 {{a second}} {{review of the}} Feed in Tariffs for low carbon {{electricity}} generation was announced {{which is likely to}} take effect from 12 December 2011. The rates for small photovoltaic installations have been reduced from 43.3p/kWh to 21 pence/kWh. The reason for the second review is that FITs for PV were being taken up too quickly and that the DECC funding allocation for FITs was in danger of being exceeded. A further reason is that the cost of installing PV panels has reduced by around 50% and therefore the FITs had become less of an encouragement to install PV panels and more of an incitement to profit from excessive subsidies.

Method {{of volume}} {{calculation}} fur stands within experimentalplots of sylvicultureStudies about forest production and more particularly the onesabout treatment methods {{should be based}} on the most accurate data. They should he qualitative and quantitative. Therefore, in orderto build the <b>tariff</b> <b>tables</b> necessary to volume estimation of stands,P. _AyRAL, Leader of the first Section of the Research Station,worked on a method of « stratified sample » whose applicationhas already given excellent results. The most important charactersare 1) Place of the trees in stories of vegetation (t, 2, 3); 2) Crown dev elopinent (: B, C); 3) Quality of the stem (D, T, r, etc [...] .). The stratified sample should include sample tree of each class ofsuch characters in every girth class, proportionally with the correspondingnumber of steins in the stand in order to avoid a systematicdistortion. Volume measurements of standing trees. necessaryto that system, are realized with the « Fcole Forestière » entrainminladder. One must then prepare, with this representative sample, a tarifftable, suitable to the stand after its thinning. The practical basis ofstudies was constitued of seven clear felled stands, most accuratelymeasured, tree by tree, after numeration. Instead of the graphical method, improper by many ways,A 1;Ani E has worked on a mathematical method, less subjective andallovfing calculation of the standard-error of volume estimation. Several mathematical laws (as V = f (c)) have ben tested(V = volume; c girth at b. h.).

40|$|Agricultural {{protection}} and subsidies {{account for about}} two-thirds of thetrade distortion caused by government policies. And most of the distor-tion traceable to agricultural policies is generated by import barriers. For that reason, negotiating wider market access in agriculture {{is critical to the}} success of the Doha Round. 1 The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agriculture Framework Agreement of July 2004 calls for significant tariff cuts using a tiered formula that imposes larger percentage cuts in higher <b>tariffs.</b> (See <b>table</b> 1 for a summary of all of the provisions.) This proposed approach is a vast improvement over the average-cut formula applied in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, which allows countries to meet their commitments through large proportional reductions in tariffs that were already low and small reductions in high tariffs. The new formula still will require substantial cuts in tariffs before meaningful trade liberalization is realized. This is because of the prevalence in agriculture of tariff peaks (a small number of tariff lines protect the bulk of domestic production), binding “overhang ” (bound tariffs are above applied tariffs), “water ” in the tariff (tariff reductions initially have no impact), and tariff escalation (higher tariffs o...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this thesis work is to explore how the fully {{implemented}} AEC affects cross-border trade in the ASEAN, {{and based on the}} findings determine how multinational companies should adapt their logistics strategy to the change. To achieve this purpose the following research questions will be answered: How will the AEC affect the distribution of goods in the ASEAN? How should a multinational company adapt their logistics strategy to the new conditions? Methodology - To explore the opportunities and threats regarding the fully implementation of AEC, the authors had to complete 4 phases including a pre-study, literature study, case study, and data analysis. The pre-study was about the basics of ASEAN. The Literature study was mainly about Logistics Management, Strategic Management, Contingency Theory, and AEC, and its aim was to find out the key factors affecting logistics strategy and how the AEC affects them. In order to locate what opportunities and threats that arise along the affected factors, a case study was conducted by studying a real-life example on a case company, through interviews and <b>tariff</b> <b>tables.</b> Additionally, data analysis was done throughout the thesis work by structured methods and a PEST analysis. Findings - Literature study showed that the affected factors where tariffs, NTBs, ROO, trade facilitation, customs integration, standards, and TBTs. After analysing how the affected factors will change the business environment by a PEST analysis, the authors found that the most crucial threat is increased competition and the greatest opportunity is in the ease of moving goods {{and the size of the}} market. Hence, for a multinational company, the best strategy in this case is a Strategic choice strategy, which is both proactive to the change and somewhat able to influence the business environment. The case study showed that in the current situation, the best economic logistics strategy is through Malaysia, no matter end destination. After the fully implemented AEC, the Free Trade Agreements for each country will be the deciding factor. Implications - This thesis is made in ASEAN for multinational companies who is considering in which ASEAN member country to use as an assembly point for the ASEAN market after the implementation of AEC. For these companies, this study can be a fundamental part of their decision. Research limitations - In this thesis, the affected factors known by literature has been considered when evaluating the consequences of a fully implemented AEC. The case study is including half of the ASEAN members and in a given order. In addition only the external business environment, and more specific the general environment, was taken into consideration. In further studies, a benchmark could be performed in order to find literature unknown factors, all ASEAN members should be included in various combinations of orders, and considering the whole business environment...|$|R

They reflect solely {{the views of}} the author, and do not necessarily reflect {{the views of the}} World Bank Group or its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent. Trade Note 23 Almost two-thirds of the economic gains that would come from dismantling all merchandise trade barriers and farm subsidies globally would come from agriculture. According to our latest research 1, this is so for the world as a whole, and also for developing countries as a group. Developing countries are therefore right to focus on agriculture in the negotiations. To date that focus has been almost exclusively on developed country policies. That is understandable, given that many in developing countries feel they did not get a good deal out of the Uruguay Round and so are determined to get significantly more commitments under Doha from developed countries before they contemplate opening their own markets further. However, our modeling suggests that over half the gains to developing countries from global agricultural reforms would come from liberalization by developing countries themselves (Table 1).
