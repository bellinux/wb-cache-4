50|$|A strong {{criticism}} about {{this project is}} with the chosen cubs. Experts state that <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>tigers</b> (Ron, Julie, Seatao and Shadow) involved in the re-wilding project are not purebred Bengal tigers {{and should not be}} used for breeding. <b>The</b> <b>four</b> <b>tigers</b> are not recorded in the Bengal tiger studbook and should not be deemed as purebred Bengal tigers. Many tigers in the world's zoos are genetically impure, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose these four are not among them. The 1997 International Tiger Studbook lists the current global captive population of Bengal tigers at 210 tigers. All of the studbook-registered captive population is maintained in Indian zoos, except for one female Bengal tiger in North America. It is important to note that Ron and Julie (two of the tigers) were bred in the United States and hand-raised at Bowmanville Zoo in Canada, while Seatow and Shadow are two tigers bred in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|A {{counterpoint}} to these examples {{is that as}} time has progressed, anti-democratic rhetoric has {{moved away from the}} philosophical and into the pragmatic. Two distinct causes have devalued the appeal of the West and its democracy. Firstly, the boom of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> and other growing Asian economies has severed the links between Western culture and material wealth {{in the eyes of many}} Chinese. In the early 1900s, scholars like Liang Qichao conflated democracy and power. For some Chinese , the economic success of Confucian and authoritarian societies challenges the idea that wholesale adoption of Western beliefs such as Democracy are requisite for economic success.|$|E

50|$|The role of Confucianism {{has been}} used to explain the success of the Four Asian Tigers. This {{conclusion}} is similar to the Protestant work ethic theory promoted by German sociologist Max Weber in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. The culture of Confucianism {{is said to have been}} compatible with industrialization because it valued stability, hard work, and loyalty and respect towards authority figures. There is a significant influence of Confucianism on the corporate and political institutions of the Asian Tigers. Confucianism was taught in Singaporean schools until the 1990s. Confucian seminars were offered by South Korean companies like Hyundai for company management. Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew advocated Asian values as an alternative to the influence of Western culture in Asia. This theory was not without its critics. There was a lack of mainland Chinese economic success during the same time frame as <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers,</b> and yet China was the birthplace of Confucianism. During the May Fourth Movement of 1919, Confucianism was blamed for China's inability to compete with Western powers.|$|E
50|$|The Hong Kong {{economy was}} the first out of the four to undergo {{industrialization}} {{with the development of}} a textile industry in the 1950s. By the 1960s, manufacturing in the British colony had expanded and diversified to include clothing, electronics, and plastics for export orientation. Following Singapore's independence from Malaysia, the Economic Development Board formulated and implemented national economic strategies to promote the country's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. Meanwhile, Taiwan and South Korea began to industrialize in the mid-1960s with heavy government involvement including initiatives and policies. Both countries pursued export-oriented industrialization as in Hong Kong and Singapore. The four countries were inspired by Japan's evident success, and they collectively pursued the same goal by investing in the same categories: infrastructure and education. They also benefited from foreign trade advantages that sets them apart from other countries, most significantly economic support from the United States; part of this is manifested in the perforation of American electronic products in common households of <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>tigers.</b> The little tigers were all influenced by Confucian ideals which valued not individual ideals, but rather a society that was mutually dependent. This also caused a common goal that required group cooperation and sacrifice.|$|E

40|$|The {{past ten}} years have {{witnessed}} many changes in the Asian economies and stock markets, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers,</b> Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They enjoyed economic growth well above the world average during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. There were sharp increases in their stock market capitalisations {{against the background of}} low growth and low interest rates in the US and European countries in the early 1990 s. This coincided with the time when measures to liberalise these markets were implemented to allow or attract foreign direct investments in their stock markets. Then by mid 1997, both their economies and stock markets began to slump. This ten year time period thus provides a good opportunity to examine how such economic and institutional changes affected the price and volatility behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> and their relationships with other markets. Overall, the findings of the thesis suggest that with the increase in foreign participation in the four individual markets, the influence of noise trading activities has been reduced through more and better informed trading. However, their relationships with three world major markets, the US, the UK and Japan, are not getting much stronger. There is no evidence to suggest that their prices are being increasingly led by the world markets, nor is their volatility becoming more sensitive to foreign news. Their price and volatility relationships with three regional markets, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, were not particularly strong either, until recently, when the Asian financial crisis has made them more responsive to shocks from one another. The message to the governments of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> is clear. Foreign direct equity investments have not destabilised their stock markets. Instead, the mismanagement of their own and/or their trading partners' economies should be held more responsible...|$|E

40|$|The authorexamines a {{range of}} {{cross-sectional}} variation in performance and policies for evidence on what distinguishes successes from failures. At about 6 percent, {{the growth rate of}} <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> - Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan (China) - are among the largest outliners in any study of growth. This is not surprising, says the author. <b>The</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> are Tigers because their growth rate was high. The Four generally have large positive residuals in growth regressions, but the author argues that this is not surprising for observations that were known in advance to {{be at the top of}} the sample. But growth regressions and, more generally, quantitative measures of"policies"are not very successful at picking out the Gang of Four as"most likely to succeed. "Most observers before the"miracle"were pessimistic about East Asia. The Four are not nearly as superlative in policies and other country characteristics as they are in per capita growth rates. Large positive residuals such as those associated with the Four's high performance have historically been transitory. The stratospheric trajectory of the Four should be heading back toward earth soon, says the author. What may be unusual about the Four's success is that they were all in one region. At least casually, the Asian successes look a lot like growth radiating from poles, with Japan followed by the Gang of Four, followed by China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The great success of the Gang of Four does not imply a blanket endorsement of all their policies - they may have made mistakes that were more than offset by other good policies and, probably at least in part, by good luck. It is disturbing how large and transitory the unexplained element is in economic success. Perhaps the best way to think about good policies is that they make success likely sooner or later. When all is said and done, the story of the East Asian successes is consistent with the prosaic fundamentals: investment, education, financial depth, and low budget deficits. In these areas, the Four were above average. Economic Conditions and Volatility,Achieving Shared Growth,Governance Indicators,Economic Growth,Inequality...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{remarkable}} economic success stories {{of the past two}} generations has been the phenomenal growth of South Korea as an export-oriented economy, one of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Tigers</b> of East Asia. Despite a brief recession in the early 1980 s, the Koreans maintained nearly double-digit growth for most of the period from 1963 to 1990. Growth slowed by half in the 1990 s, and Korea was hit by a more severe recession following the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 - 1998, but remade itself as a major technology power in the following decade. Added to this widely heralded economic miracle was a kind of political miracle in 1987 - 1988, the establishment of a genuinely constitutional democracy with a peaceful transition of power. This paper considers the recent political and economic development of South Korea, with reference to scholarly work.

40|$|Singapore {{is known}} as one of <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>tigers</b> of the Pacific Rim. Although Singapore is a tiny island country with no natural resources, the {{government}} of Singapore has aggressively pursued national policies and initiatives which have enabled it to enter the world industrial mainstream. In this article, Gable and Raman describe one such government inltlative designed to help small businesses computerize. In simple terms, the Singapore government set up the Small Enterprise Computerization Program (SECP) under the National Computer Board with,a charter to provide small businesses with funds and appropriate technical support to determine their computer requirements and to design their computer infrastructure. This article describes the history of the Program, how it evolved over time, and what was learned along the way. The authors conclude that strong government commitment, and the availability of financial resources, appropriate technology, and technical expertise, were essential to the successful implementation of the Program. One of the most gratifying aspects of the Program Is the significant impact that resulted from its relatively simple, low-cost approach. Although the approach and the Program would most likely be modified to meet local conditions, the concept is easily transportable to other countries seeking to upgrade the informatlon system capabilities of their small business community...|$|E

40|$|Globalisation is {{a central}} concept in this paper but it is {{important}} to note that 2 ̆ 7 globalisation 2 ̆ 7 is a highly contested term. Strong globalisation theory argues that the global economy is dominated by uncontrollable global forces in which nation states are structurally constrained and therefore the capacity of modern states eventually declines. Unlike strong globalists, other scholars believe even though there may be similar trends and patterns in public policy and public management domain along the line of privatisation, marketisation, commodification and corporatisation, different governments may use the similar strategies to serve their own political purposes. Hence, modern states may tactically make use of the globalisation discourse to justify their own political agendas or legitimise their inaction. The present paper sets out in this wider context to reflect upon globalisation effects on national policy, with particular reference to how the selected East Asian societies such as <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>Tigers,</b> Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea as well as mainland China have transformed their higher education systems.

40|$|Western industrialism has {{achieved}} miracles, promoting unprecedented levels of prosperity and raising millions {{around the world}} out of poverty. Industrial capitalism is now diffusing throughout the East. Japan, <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>Tigers</b> (Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong) and China are all incorporating themselves into the global industrial world. India, Brazil and many others are expected to follow the same course. But as China, India and other industrializing giants grow, they confront an inconvenient truth: they cannot rely on the Western industrial development model of fossil-fueled energy systems (resource throughput rather than circularity and generic finance) because these methods cause extreme spoliation {{of the environment and}} raise energy security, resource security and global warming concerns. By necessity, a new approach to environmentally conscious development is already emerging in the East, with China leading the way in building a green industry at scale. As opposed to Western zero-growth advocates and free-market environmentalists, {{it can be argued that}} a more sustainable capitalism is being developed in China – to counter black developmental model based on coal. This new ‘green growth’ model of development, being perfected in China and now being emulated in India, Brazil, South Africa (and eventually by industrializing countries elsewhere), as well as by advanced industrial countries such as Germany, looks to become the new norm in the twenty-first century. Its core advantages are the energy security and resource security that are generated. The British scientist James Lovelock has done the world an enormous service by formulating the theory of a ‘living earth’ named Gaia, where life self-regulates itself and the planet by keeping the atmospheric environment more or less constant, and likewise the environment of the oceans. In China’s Green Shift, Global Green Shift, Mathews proposes a way in which Gaia (a product of the processes of the earth) can be complemented by Ceres (our own creation of a renewable energy and circular economy system). Can these two concepts of how the earth works, represented by two powerful deities, be reconciled? While Lovelock is pessimistic, asserting that Gaia will look after herself and that if we survive at all it is likely to be as a greatly diminished industrial civilization, numbering no more than one billion people, Mathews argues in this book why he believes this prognosis to be mistaken. Mathews maintains that the changes that ‘we’ are driving, as a species, represent a viable way forward. They give us a chance of reconciling economy with ecology – or Ceres with Gaia.
