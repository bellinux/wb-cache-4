40|$|Although {{a lot of}} attentions {{have been}} paid to human mobility, the {{relationship}} between <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> with city structure is still unclear. Here we probe into this relationship by analyzing the metro passenger trip data. There are two unprecedented findings. One, from the average view a linear law exists between the individual's travel distance with his original distance to city center. The mechanism underlying is a <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> we called "ring aggregation", i. e., the daily movement of city passengers is just aggregating to a ring with roughly equal distance to city center. Interestingly, for the round trips the daily <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> {{can be regarded as}} a switching between the home ring at outer area with the office ring at the inner area. Second, this linear law and ring aggregation pattern seems to be an exclusive characteristic of the metro system. It can not be found in short distance transportation modes, such as bicycle and taxi, neither as multiple transportation modes. This means the ring aggregation pattern is a token of the relationship between <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> with city structure in the large scale space. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model for {{integrated}} analysis of household location and travel choices and investigate it from a theoretical point of view. Each household makes a joint choice of location (zone and house type) and a <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> that maximizes utility subject to budget and time constraints. Prices for housing are calculated so that demand equals supply in each submarket. The <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> consists {{of a set of}} expected trip frequencies to different destinations with different modes. The joint time and budget constraints ensure that time and cost sensitivities are consistent throughout the model. Choosing the entire <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> at once, as opposed to treating travel decisions as a series of isolated choices, allows the marginal utilities of trips to depend on which other trips are made. When choosing trip frequencies to destinations, households are assumed to prefer variation to an extent varying with the purpose of the trip. The <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> will tend to be more evenly distributed across trip ends the less similar destinations and individual preferences are. These heterogeneities of destinations and individual preferences, respectively, are expressed in terms of a set of parameters to be estimated. ...|$|R

The literature has been evolving from simple to more sophisticated methods such as from aggregated to individual <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis, and from stop-to-stop to flexible stop aggregation.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, {{changing}} <b>travel</b> <b>patterns</b> decreased {{the importance of}} the Strait of Georgia run from Victoria to New Westminster.

[...] By the late 1890s ocean-going vessels were going directly to the canneries on the Fraser River, eliminating the need for steamers to carry the packed salmon to Victoria. [...] Also, when the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway was completed with its terminus at Vancouver, BC, steamship traffic shifted over to Vancouver as the preferred point to disembark passengers and unload inland bound cargo.

Occupation and commuting type appear to be strongly affected on differences on commuting time. In the second step, the home to work <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> is explored whether it reflects consistency with the standard urban economic theory. Results reflect that the behavioral assumption of cost minimization for the journey to work in the standard model is inadequate when explaining the relation between job and housing location. In the third step, the home to work <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> is investigated in local context in terms of spatial distribution of workers both on working and residential areas. While living and working at the same geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district decreases the commuting time, living and working at the different geographic part of the metropolitan area or the district significantly increases the commuting time. ...|$|R

This paper aims at investigating the effects of Beijing subway’s new fare policy on the riders’ attitude, <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> and demand. A survey analysis was conducted to identify {{the effects of the}} new fare policy for Beijing subway on riders’ satisfaction degree and <b>travel</b> <b>pattern</b> associated with the potential influencing factors using Hierarchical Tree-based Regression (HTBR) models. The model results show that income, travel distance and month of travel have significant impacts on the subway riders’ satisfaction degree, while trip purpose, car ownership and travel frequency significantly influence the riders’ stated <b>travel</b> <b>pattern.</b> Overall, the degree of satisfaction could not be effectively recovered within five months after the new fare policy, but the negative public attitude did not depress the subway demand continuously. Based on the further time sequence analyses of the passenger flow volume data for two years, it is concluded that the new policy made the ridership decrease sharply in the first month but gradually came back to the previous level four months later, and then the passenger flow volume kept steady again. The findings in this study indicate that the new fare policy realized the purpose of lowering the government’s financial pressure but did not reduce the subway ridership in a long term perspective...|$|R
