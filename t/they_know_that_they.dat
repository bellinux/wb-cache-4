25|$|There {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meet them, and so on.|$|E
25|$|That's when Shan Mei and Frank meet {{numerous}} times. But both of {{them are}} having money issues so they decide to live together. Little do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both started falling in love with one another.|$|E
25|$|Number Four is {{the primary}} defence player. They can move {{anywhere}} on the field, but they usually try to prevent scoring. The emphasis on defence by the Number Four allows the Number Three to attempt more offensive plays, since <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be covered if they lose the ball.|$|E
50|$|Common {{knowledge}} {{is a special}} kind of knowledge for a group of agents. There is common knowledge of p in a group of agents G when all the agents in G <b>know</b> p, <b>they</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> p, <b>they</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> p, and so on ad infinitum.|$|R
5000|$|Then the eies of {{them both}} were opened, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were naked, and they sewed figge tree leaves together, and made {{themselves}} breeches.|$|R
6000|$|Ver. 7. [...] "And {{the eyes}} of them both were opened, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made {{themselves}} aprons." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E
25|$|Airlines use futures {{contracts}} and derivatives to hedge {{their exposure to}} the price of jet fuel. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must purchase jet fuel {{for as long as they}} want to stay in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their fuel requirements (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is {{what it feels like to}} believe that religion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] remarked Waller sarcastically, [...] "'cause <b>they</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} man as comes on is sartin sure to fall, an' <b>they</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can't come on without {{somebody}} comin' first." ...|$|R
6000|$|Red and Slim {{found the}} two strange little animals {{the morning after}} [...] they heard the thunder sounds. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could never show [...] their new pets to their parents.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say so, Issachar, but I {{have seen}} men climb high to pluck such fruit. Yes, I {{have seen them}} climb even when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must fall before the fruit was reached." ...|$|R
2500|$|If {{a county}} has no player in its squad who is {{eligible}} for a benefit but has not yet had one, it may organise a [...] "county benefit" [...] or a [...] "youth cricket benefit" [...] {{to raise funds for}} special projects, but these often do not raise much money as many people are more interested in taking part in a benefit if <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are helping an individual.|$|E
2500|$|Heartened {{by their}} success, the outlaws attempt to march on Nottingham itself. However, the Earl of Wessex traps {{them in a}} pincer {{movement}} between Nottingham and Newark and defeats them all. When his ally the Archbishop wonders aloud why the rebels die so willingly on the swords of his soldiers the Earl replies grimly: [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are going to win}} - but not in my time".|$|E
2500|$|Most healthy {{participants}} sample {{cards from}} each deck, and after about 40 or 50 selections are fairly good at {{sticking to the}} good decks. Patients with OFC dysfunction, however, continue to perseverate with the bad decks, sometimes even though <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are losing money overall. Concurrent measurement of galvanic skin response shows that healthy participants show a [...] "stress" [...] reaction to hovering over the bad decks after only 10 trials, long before conscious sensation that the decks are bad. By contrast, patients with OFC dysfunction never develop this physiological reaction to impending punishment. Bechara and his colleagues explain {{this in terms of}} the somatic marker hypothesis. The Iowa gambling task is currently being used by a number of research groups using fMRI to investigate which brain regions are activated by the task in healthy volunteers as well as clinical groups with conditions such as schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} {{by the time}} their task was accomplished. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not get back to camp, yet {{none of them had}} any desire to remain in the {{vicinity}} of the lion.|$|R
60|$|They {{seemed quite}} {{alone in the}} world, those two, and yet their hearts were full of joy and thankfulness, for while they were left to each other <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could never be alone.|$|R
60|$|This {{information}} was received in deep silence--perhaps {{it was the}} silence of despair, for the quantity hitherto served out had been barely sufficient to moisten their parched throats, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not exist long on the reduced allowance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Marco, [...] "but then <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{can get out}} {{whenever}} they please. We don't {{know that we can}} ever get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am not {{surprised}} that people are so loth to die when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will see such horrible creatures.' But, low as she spoke, the giantess caught the words, and began to laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, sir, if {{they are}} that sort of men why do they go and enlist in the army instead of {{becoming}} sailors. It {{stands to reason that}} it is because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot do work.” ...|$|E
60|$|The ladies were, of course, {{somewhat}} alarmed {{while the}} boat was thumping on the bar, and the boiling surges were roaring so frightfully around them; but <b>they</b> said nothing. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had nothing to do, and so they remained quiet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley. [...] "If she has {{rejected}} him, she's {{done a very}} safe thing. Nobody {{should be allowed to}} marry before fifty. Then, if people married, it would be because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> loved each other." ...|$|R
60|$|They watched it, horrified, for {{a moment}} or two; and said nothing for a brief space when it {{vanished}} altogether into the obscurity. The sight was more unpleasant because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had seen only the commencement of that awful journey. Then Devine, who was white and gasping, made a deprecatory gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} tell you to keep a sharp lookout, Captain Whitney. We know the blacks are a very strong party and, now <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are pursued they may, as likely as not, make a stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Peigan warriors are double-tongued; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have hid the Pale-face prisoners. We do {{not wish}} to quarrel, but if they are not {{delivered}} up at once, the Pale-faces and the Peigans will not be friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, sir, I don’t {{know that}} they are {{altogether}} to be blamed; it is only human nature to pay back a blow for a blow, and with savages like these, especially when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are bound to be hanged, you could hardly expect anything else.” ...|$|E
50|$|Of Asano's over 300 men, 47, {{especially}} their leader Ōishi, {{refused to allow}} their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be severely punished for doing so.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{too nice}} a point," [...] he declared. [...] "We may not reckon {{it in his}} favour. I wonder how our friends {{on the other side}} felt when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had paid fifty {{thousand}} pounds for false information? We ought to make you a peer, Ducaine. The Trogoldy money would stand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, General, until <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were to go}} free none {{of these}} prisoners would tell us anything. However closely they were questioned, <b>they</b> said <b>that</b> it was against their oath, and <b>that</b> first <b>they</b> would die. A long while ago I asked this very man of Egypt, and he vowed {{that he had never}} been there." ...|$|R
60|$|MAN (impatient of {{so stupid}} a question). It's {{running away with}} him, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed? Then they all come. You can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. The old ones come bunched up under the number one guard: <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are mere projectiles, and that it's no use trying to fight. The wounds are mostly broken knees, from the horses cannoning together.|$|E
6000|$|Now and then, {{rubbing his}} eyes, vigorously, an editor catches a sudden {{glimpse of the}} {{revolution}} and breaks out in naive volubility, as, for instance, the one who wrote the following in the Chicago Chronicle: [...] "American socialists are revolutionists. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are revolutionists. It is high time that other people should appreciate the fact." [...] A white-hot, brand-new discovery, and he proceeded to shout it out from the housetops that we, forsooth, were revolutionists. Why, it is just {{what we have been}} doing all these years--shouting it out from the housetops that we are revolutionists, and stop us who can.|$|E
60|$|Only the gnats {{and flies}}? You might study those gnats and flies for {{your whole life}} without finding out all--or more than a very little--about them. I wish I knew how they move those tiny wings of theirs--a {{thousand}} times in a second, I dare say, some of them. I wish I knew how far <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are happy--for happy they must be, whether they know it or not. I wish I knew how they live at all. I wish I even knew how many sorts there are humming round us at this moment.|$|E
5000|$|The Bible {{states in}} the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: [...] "And the eyes of them both were opened, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made {{themselves}} girdles". Based on that reference, the forbidden fruit may have been the fig.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{old lady}} looked so very stern that Tom was quite frightened, and sorry {{that he had been}} so bold. But she was not angry with him. She only answered, [...] "I look after them all the week round; and they are in a very {{different}} place from this, because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were doing wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|Far from excited, Daylight had all {{the seeming}} of being stunned. He felt absently in his vest pocket for a match, lighted it, and {{discovered}} {{that he had no}} cigarette. The three men watched him with the tense closeness of cats. Now <b>that</b> it had come, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had a nasty few minutes before them.|$|R
