She made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of the situation comedy The Tim Conway Show, which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred {{on the big screen}} one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film Trog (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than eighty motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode ("The Nightmare") of The Virginian and as Joan Fairchild (her final performance) in a 1972 episode ("Dear Joan: We're Going <b>to</b> <b>Scare</b> <b>You</b> to Death") of The Sixth Sense.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{might be a}} little too {{straightforward}} in spots, but it does make for a solid action game." [...] He concluded that [...] "although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying <b>to</b> <b>scare</b> <b>you,</b> it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [...] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game." ...|$|E

[...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to laugh with and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian or not you will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E

Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering [...] "what kind of Mansonite crazoid" [...] could have created such a thing. It is a work of [...] "cataclysmic terror", in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, [...] "I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country."
