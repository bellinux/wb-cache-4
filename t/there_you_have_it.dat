60|$|The above {{penalties}} were by {{no means}} indiscriminately inflicted. The missionaries have prepared a sort of penal tariff to facilitate judicial proceedings.

My friend, the man of God, says he thinks the cause of sound is motion in the air passing from particle to particle, till the last particle next my ear is moved, and then--I hear.

5000|$|Rudolf Mössbauer was an {{excellent}} teacher.

But there is the breakfast gong, and she will be waiting impatiently to know how it fared with you last night.

6000|$|But {{the work}} of these gentlemen {{confirms}} my own experience that {{it is quite possible}} to tell in a comprehensible and inspiring outline the whole history of life and mankind in the compass of a couple of manageable volumes.
