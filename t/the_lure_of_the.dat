25|$|The {{events of}} {{the latter half of}} 1718 {{represent}} {{a turning point in the}} history of piracy in the New World. Without a safe base and in the growing pressure from naval forces, the rovers lost their momentum. <b>The</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish treasures had faded, and the hunters gradually became the hunted. By early 1719, the remaining pirates were on the run. Most of them headed for West Africa, seizing poorly defended slavers.|$|E
25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between <b>the</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E
50|$|Home roasters {{can choose}} from various types of {{roasting}} equipment, {{each of which has}} certain attributes that can alter the flavor. A roasting profile describes the time the beans spend at each temperature during roasting including the final temperature prior to cooling. This greatly affects the flavor, aroma, and body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coffee. Home roasters {{go to great lengths to}} control these roasting parameters including using computers or programmable controllers for process control and data logging. Manually controlled equipment makes precise and repeatable profile control more difficult, though an experienced roaster can produce very good results. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobby is experimenting with the roasting profile to produce optimal tasting coffee, albeit subjective.|$|R

40|$|In Burkina Faso, {{informal}} mining camps attract {{girls and}} women from rural areas because they {{offer a variety of}} income generating activities and access to urban consumer goods. Moreover, migration to the mines also allows for a different life-style and greater personal freedom. On the other hand, by going to the mining camps, {{girls and women}} risk acquiring a bad reputation in their communities because they are suspected of having illicit sexual relationships. In fact, relationships with gold miners and the material benefits connected with them are among <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold mines. Thus, from a female perspective migration to the gold mines is fraught with ambivalence, which is expressed in songs performed by female day labourers.

25|$|The {{history of}} Sioux Falls {{revolves}} around the cascades of the Big Sioux River. The falls were created about 14,000 years ago during the last ice age. <b>The</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falls has been a powerful influence. Ho-Chunk, Ioway, Otoe, Missouri, Omaha (and Ponca at the time), Quapaw, Kansa, Osage, Arikira, Dakota, and Cheyenne people inhabited and settled the region previous to Europeans and European descendants. Numerous burial mounds still exist on the high bluffs near the river and are spread throughout the general vicinity. Indigenous people maintained an agricultural society with fortified villages, and the later arrivals rebuilt {{on many of the}} same sites that were previously settled. Lakota populate urban and reservation communities in the contemporary state and many Lakota, Dakota, and numerous other Indigenous Americans reside in Sioux Falls today.|$|E
25|$|The {{popular and}} {{successful}} balletic Dracula adaptation by Michael Pink and Christopher Gable premiered in 1997, {{to commemorate the}} centenary publication of the novel. It was created for the Northern Ballet Theatre in the United Kingdom. The production stays as faithful to the book as possible in non-verbal theatre. Original music was composed by Philip Feeney, the Naxos recording of the score has remained a top seller. Sets and costumes were designed by Lez Brotherston, whose career as a designer for dance began with NBT. Lighting was by Paul Pyant. The production has been seen throughout the world, most companies presenting the work more than once during the last decade.

500|$|Dutton {{felt that}} the Rangers were {{responsible}} for the league's refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime. His vow became known as [...] "Dutton's Curse". Additionally, he never set foot in an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames' history. Dutton's 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league's owners, but also because Dutton himself found <b>the</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game too strong, and knew he had to step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.|$|E
500|$|Clinton Heylin {{and writer}} Christopher Ricks {{discussed}} Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin {{said that in}} [...] "Ballad of Easy Rider", co-written by Dylan and Roger McGuinn two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while [...] "The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's where I want to be"; by contrast, in [...] "Watching the River Flow", Dylan writes {{that he wants to}} be moving, wishing he was [...] "back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied bucolic notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the [...] "choppy" [...] rhythms and [...] "stroppy stomping" [...] of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with [...] "People disagreeing", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is [...] "tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates <b>the</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lazy".|$|E

500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the [...] "bad" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>lure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.|$|E

The lyrics to [...] "Who Can See It" [...] reflect Harrison's disenchantment with his previous, junior status to former bandmates Lennon and Paul McCartney, while [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] was his comment on McCartney's 1971 High Court action to dissolve the band as a business entity. In line with Prabhupada's teachings, all such pursuits of fame, wealth or position meant nothing in Harrison's 1972 world-view. Author Gary Tillery writes of Material Worlds lyrical content: [...] "The album expresses his impressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mundane and the spiritual worlds and <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> ignoring <b>the</b> <b>lures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> everyday world and remaining focused on the eternal verities." [...] Even in seemingly conventional love songs such as [...] "That Is All" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", Harrison appeared to be addressing his deity {{as much as any}} human partner. Musically, the latter composition reflects <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Brill Building songwriters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, while Harrison sings of a love delivered [...] "like it came from above".|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{am going}} to analyze <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> “gendered space” as it appears in select post- 1970 s US-American road {{narratives}} produced by women writers of various ethnic and social backgrounds. Drawing on recent re-mappings in cultural geography, I will cross disciplinary boundaries and argue that for female literary protagonists, the “open road” appears as a dangerous frontier—in which women’s physical and emotional well-being is always at perilous stake—rather than as an adventurous playground. In women’s road stories, the American highway does not maintain its mythical, iconic status, signifying freedom and the heroic quest for identity, which has been ascribed to it at least since <b>the</b> legendary accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight from domesticity by Jack Kerouac and his fellow (anti-) heroes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beat generation. Female protagonists, too, it will be shown, feel <b>the</b> <b>luring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, or see cross-country travel as a way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideology <b>of</b> separate spheres—and, from a socio-historical perspective, they indeed have much more reason for doing so than their male counterparts. However, more often than not, women {{come to realize that}} they are “prisoners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway” (as Joni Mitchell puts it in her famous road-song “Coyote”), and as such are not liberated by mere motion, but confronted with spatial limitations not much different from those encountered at the hearth. Nevertheless, by embracing these multiple confrontations for the challenges they present, and by deliberately transgressing gendered boundaries of public vs. private and cultural vs. natural space, <b>the</b> itinerant protagonists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts under discussion eventually re-appropriate their share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road...|$|R
