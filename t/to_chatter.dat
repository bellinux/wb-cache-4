2500|$|In 1998, Chakraverti campaigned as an Indian National Congress {{candidate}} for the Parliament of India in the Hooghly district. She was requested {{to take up the}} post on behalf of Sonia Gandhi, but was not elected. Later, Chakraverti became the Secretary of the West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee. She then started working on her biography, titled Beloved Witch: An Autobiography. The book tells how she came to be a Wiccan and how she had carried on the tag of being a [...] "witch" [...] in a society where witches are still feared and hated. The book, after its release in November 2000, won critical acclaim. Nona Walia of The Times of India commented, [...] "Roy Chakraverti knows that it is unusual for well-bred Bengali girls to become witches and acknowledges her gratitude to her mother for allowing her the right to choose. After all, she says, every strong woman can be a witch in her own right, and that is perhaps the truest message that the book holds for the reader. [...] If {{there is a problem with}} the book, it is that much is left unsaid and much of it seems hurried, as if an editor said, 'Don't make it too serious, people won't understand,' just enough for people <b>to</b> <b>chatter</b> about at a cocktail party." ...|$|E

30|$|This is {{the major}} {{approach}} <b>to</b> resolve <b>chatter</b> vibration problem in the milling process via the operational amplifier circuit. Encouraged by the above consideration, a proportional-integral controller is proposed <b>to</b> suppress the <b>chatter</b> vibrations in the milling process.

30|$|The {{optimal control}} given by (36) is regular unless K= 0 and ∥h(t)∥= 0, {{in which case}} it becomes singular. As before the term K ∫ _ 0 ^t_fu(t)^ 2 dt in the cost {{functional}} (34) is used <b>to</b> avoid <b>chattering</b> [44, 63, 72, 90, 91], and the exact minimum time solution can be approached by decreasing step by step the value of K≥ 0 until the shooting method possibly fails due <b>to</b> <b>chattering.</b>|$|R
