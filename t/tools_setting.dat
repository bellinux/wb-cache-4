40|$|Background and Aim: Obtaining patent airway is {{a crucial}} task for many physicians. When {{opportunities}} to practice intubations on patients are really limited, skill gaining methods are needed. We conducted a study among novice 6 th year medical students to assess their ability to intubate the trachea in normal airway in manikin using four airway <b>tools.</b> <b>Setting</b> and Design: Prospective, cohort study conducted at simulation center of university-based, tertiary care hospital. Methods: Fifty medical students performed either oral or nasal tracheal intubation using the following four intubating tools: C-Mac videolaryngoscope, Glidescope, and Airtraq in comparison with regular Macintosh laryngoscope. Intubation time, visualization of glottic opening, ease of intubation, satisfaction of participants, incidence of dental trauma, {{and the need for}} optimization manoeuvres′ use among different airway tools were recorded. Results: In oral intubation, Airtraq was better than others in regard to intubation time, glottic opening, ease of intubation, and the need for external laryngeal pressure application, followed by Glidescope, C-Mac, and finally Macintosh laryngoscope (P< 0. 001). Airtraq and Glidescope associated with less dental trauma than C-Mac and Macintosh. In nasal route, fastest intubation time was reported with Airtraq followed by Glidescope, C-Mac, and lastly Macintosh. Airtraq, Glidescope, and C-Mac were similar to each other and better than the Macintosh in regard to ease of intubation, satisfaction, and number of attempts (P≤ 0. 008). Conclusions: New devices like Airtraq, Glidescope, and C-Mac are better than the regular Macintosh when used by novice medical students for oral and nasal intubation on manikin...|$|E
40|$|The {{banking system}} in {{contemporary}} conditions becomes the critically important subsystem of any national economy. To ensure a successful and profitable {{operation of the}} bank the effective management of associated risks is necessary. A technique of banking risk management, which includes three functional blocks: monitoring, identification and protection against risks, is proposed in the article. A key element of the proposed method is the stage of optimization of risk management {{in the context of}} the particular situation of data analysis and decision making. The two-factor model of optimizing the choice of means of risk management is argued. This model implies two options: to minimize the level of allowable risks when you fix the volume of the resources required for reliable risk management in this particular situation on an acceptable (target, desired) level; or to minimize the volume of the resources required for reliable in this situation analyzed risk management when you fixed appropriate risks at an acceptable level. The technique is based on an integrated approach, the basic elements of which are the abilities to work with different types of data, and to use common methods and means of data processing. The proposed method makes it possible to integrate qualitative and quantitative risk management tools in a single process of data analysis and decision making support. The proposed method of banking risk management is a tool to detail the national regulators recommendations by taking into account the specific (context) features of a particular financial institution management during its implementation. The technique allows for contextual <b>tools</b> <b>setting,</b> depending on the application field...|$|E
40|$|Systemic Constellation {{describes}} {{an approach that}} enables practitioners to examine and address typical issues in diversity management from a different, relational perspective. Systemic Constellation utilizes the human ability to recognize the qualities of relationships between two or more people from their spatial alignment to each other (transverbal language) and the capability to illustrate inner pictures by placing humans or objects in a room as representatives (representative perception). Systemic Constellation originated {{in the field of}} family therapy and counseling, but through research, guidance work, and teaching activities over the last two decades, it has developed into a generic, structural, constellation logic with multiple methods of application. It has been adapted to a variety of topics and issues, and a number of constellation formats. This article serves {{as a starting point for}} the transfer of Systemic Constellation into diversity management. It appears that conventional approaches taught in traditional management classes (such as focusing on <b>tools,</b> <b>setting</b> targets, planning measures, and offering incentives) are of limited use when trying to deal with problematic situations in diversity management. Preliminary trials show that new solutions and insights into deeper underlying dynamics can be gained on personal and institutional levels when applying Systemic Constellation. Participants find the application of the model as very beneficial. Systemic Constellation is grounded in personal experience and particularly in a person’s own experience of the consistency of representative perception. This viewpoint can only be conveyed rudimentarily in a scientific article. Readers should feel encouraged to apply Systemic Constellations themselves and use it in their work, experimentally and professionally. To harness the full potential of Systemic Constellations in diversity management, further research needs to be done...|$|E

40|$|Objective.   To {{examine and}} compare the psychometric {{properties}} of two common observational pain assessment tools used in persons with dementia. Design.   In a cross-sectional descriptive study nursing home (NH) residents were videotaped at rest and during a structured movement procedure. Following one training session and one practice session, two trained graduate nursing research assistants independently scored the tapes using the two pain observation <b>tools.</b> <b>Setting.</b>   Fourteen NHs in Western Washington State participating in a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to enhance pain assessment and management. Participants.   Sixty participants with moderate to severe pain were identified by nursing staff or chosen based on the pain items from the most recent Minimum Data Set assessment. Measures.   Checklist of Nonverbal Pain Indicators (CNPI) and the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD), demographic and pain-related data (Minimum Data Set), nursing assistant reports of participants 2 ̆ 7 usual pain intensity, and Pittsburgh Agitation Scale. Results.   Internal consistency for both tools was good except for the CNPI at rest for one rater. Inter-rater reliability for pain presence was fair (K = 0. 25 for CNPI with movement; K = 0. 31 for PAINAD at rest) to moderate (K = 0. 43 for CNPI at rest; K = 0. 54 for PAINAD with movement). There were significant differences in mean CNPI and PAINAD scores at rest and during movement, providing support for construct validity. However, both tools demonstrated marked floor effects, particularly when participants were at rest. Conclusions.   Despite earlier studies supporting {{the reliability and validity of}} the CNPI and the PAINAD, findings from the current study indicate that these measures warrant further study with clinical users, should be used cautiously both in research and clinical settings and only as part of a comprehensive approach to pain assessment...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> and often create custom <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> also incorporates a collection of MATLAB scripts that allow the investigator to post process these data in {{a standard}} way, such as automating the processes of noise floor removal, burst start/stop time identification, and mean/median frequency calculation in electromyograms (EMGs).
