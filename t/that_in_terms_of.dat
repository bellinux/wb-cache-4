25|$|Similarly for Ottoman Egypt, its per-capita {{income in}} 1800 was {{comparable}} to that of leading Western European countries such as France, and higher than the overall average income of Europe and Japan.

25|$|A {{major problem}} for urban {{planning}} and effective public transit in Miami-Dade and South Florida is the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> planning, {{it is one of}} the most sprawled out and automobile dependent metropolitan areas in the United States, with a lot of lowly contrasted medium density development spread throughout the area. For example, a very low percentage of the area's office space is located in the Central Business District (CBD) of Miami (only 13%, the lowest in the nation, in 1999). Additionally, there has been very little transit-oriented development (TOD). Subsequently, transit access between people and jobs in the city and region remains limited.|$|E

25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web {{and a real}} Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have {{a limit to how}} many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them.|$|E
25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ {{went so far as to}} say that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
