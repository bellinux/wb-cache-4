5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published {{on the front page of}} the Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E
5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E

5|$|On 18 April Keeler was {{attacked}} {{at the home}} of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, Timothy Bligh, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that he had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, to inquire into possible security breaches.|$|E

25|$|The three-month-long trial {{concluded}} with Aguirre winning a $6 million award against Manville, at that time, the largest amount in San Diego Superior Court history. The amount was later increased to $7.5 million when delay damages were added. On July 2, 1982, {{the day after}} winning his lawsuit against Manville, Aguirre went back to court <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> Manville be required to post a $9 million bond to guarantee his clients' judgment {{in case of a}} bankruptcy filing, arguing that Manville {{was on the verge of}} filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Agreeing with Aguirre’s argument, the judge ordered Manville to post a bond.|$|E
25|$|In early June 1940, about 13,500 {{evacuees}} {{were shipped}} to Casablanca in French Morocco. However, following the capitulation of the French to the German armies in June 1940 {{and the destruction}} of the French fleet at Mers el-Kebir by the British fleet, the new Pro-German French Vichy Government asked for all Gibraltarians to be removed. An opportunity for their removal soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived at Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating French servicemen rescued from Dunkirk. Once they had disembarked, the ships were interned until they agreed to take on all the evacuees. Although Crichton could not clean and restock his ships (and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees), he eventually agreed to do so. However, when the evacuees arrived in Gibraltar, the Governor, Sir Clive Liddel, did not allow them to land, fearing that once the evacuees were back on The Rock, it would be virtually impossible to re-evacuate them. Crowds gathered at John Mackintosh Square as the news of the orders not to land broke, speeches were made and two City Councilors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor Liddell <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> the evacuees be allowed to land. After receiving instructions from London, a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived, and by 13 July the re-evacuation had been completed.|$|E

25|$|Romania's elite {{had been}} {{intensely}} Francophile ever since Romania had won its {{independence in the}} 19th century, indeed so Francophile that the defeat of France in June 1940 {{had the effect of}} discrediting the entire elite. Antonescu's internment ended in August, during which interval, under Axis pressure, Romania had ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (see Treaty of Craiova) and Northern Transylvania to Hungary (see Second Vienna Award). The latter grant caused consternation among large sections of Romania's population, causing Carol's popularity to fall to a record low and provoking large-scale protests in Bucharest, the capital. These movements were organized competitively by the pro-Allied PNȚ, headed by Iuliu Maniu, and the pro-Nazi Iron Guard. The latter group had been revived under the leadership of Horia Sima, and was organizing a coup d'état. In this troubled context, Antonescu simply left his assigned residence. He may have been secretly helped in this by German intercession, but was more directly aided to escape by socialite Alice Sturdza, who was acting on Maniu's request. Antonescu subsequently met with Maniu in Ploiești, where they discussed how best to manage the political situation. While these negotiations were carried out, the monarch himself was being advised by his entourage to recover legitimacy by governing in tandem with the increasingly popular Antonescu, while creating a new political majority from the existing forces. On 2 September 1940, Valer Pop, a courtier and an important member of the camarilla first advised Carol to appoint Antonescu as Prime Minister as the solution to the crisis. Pop's reasons for advising Carol to have Antonescu as Prime Minister who was partly because Antonescu-who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and had been imprisoned under Carol-was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to Carol's regime to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu for all his Legionary sympathies {{was a member of the}} elite and would never turn against it. When Carol proved reluctant to have Antonescu as Prime Minister, Pop visited the German legation to meet with Fabricius on the night 4 September 1940 <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> the German minister phone Carol to tell him that Reich wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister; Fabricius's promptly did just that. Carol and Antonescu accepted the proposal, Antonescu being mandated to approach political party leaders Maniu of the PNȚ and Dinu Brătianu of the PNL. They all called for Carol's abdication as a preliminary measure, while Sima, another leader sought after for negotiations, could not be found in time to express his opinion. Antonescu partly complied with the request but also asked Carol to bestow upon him the reserve powers for Romanian heads of state. Carol yielded and, on September 5, 1940, the general became Prime Minister, and Carol transferred most of his dictatorial powers to him. The latter's first measure was to curtail potential resistance within the Army by relieving Bucharest Garrison chief Gheorghe Argeșanu of his position and replacing him with Dumitru Coroamă. Shortly afterward, Antonescu heard rumors that two of Carol's loyalist generals, Gheorghe Mihail and Paul Teodorescu, were planning to have him killed. In reaction, he forced Carol to abdicate, while General Coroamă was refusing to carry out the royal order of shooting down Iron Guardist protesters.|$|E

[...] The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest [...] "wasn't in his right mind, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> question". Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film. Outside of the arena, there were dozens of police cruisers lining the roads out of the parking lots.|$|E
500|$|The new {{interchange}} with SR 94 {{was completed}} in July 1976. In August, the California Highway Commission (CHC) announced that SR 75 south of SR 54 {{had been removed from}} the state highway plan. The next year, the county supervisor, a San Diego City councilman, and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to then-Governor Jerry Brown <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> this portion of SR 125 and other freeways be constructed. There were concerns about the types of congestion seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to the Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the possible deletions; in response, Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed, and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram, calling it [...] "intemperate". However, the city of Chula Vista was opposed to the construction at the time, which was a factor in the removal of SR 125 from the highway plans.|$|E
500|$|Treloar {{continued}} {{to expand the}} Australian War Museum's collections during the 1920s. For instance, in 1921 he wrote to all the Australian Victoria Cross recipients of World War I or their families <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> they donate their wartime diaries or other personal items. The Museum also actively sought the wartime diaries and letters written by {{other members of the}} AIF; Treloar hoped that these records would allow a psychological study to be conducted on the men who had joined the AIF. Taking up an idea of Bean's, Treloar oversaw the development of several dioramas depicting key Australian battles of the war and engaged professional artists to make the models. Several of the dioramas produced in the 1920s remain on display in the AWM and are among its most popular exhibits. Treloar also oversaw the completion of the artworks which had been commissioned from the official war artists during World War I and, in collaboration with Bean, ordered additional works. The institution was renamed the [...] "Australian War Memorial Museum" [...] in 1923, most likely on the suggestion of Treloar.|$|E

Her justification for asking to be the exception to the church's rule was Emma Smith's offer in 1844 to have her sealed to the Smith family as a child. James was now reconsidering her decision, and asked to be sealed to the Smiths. Her requests were again refused. Instead, the First Presidency [...] "decided she might be adopted into the family of Joseph Smith as a servant, which was done, a special ceremony having been prepared for the purpose." [...] The ceremony took place on May 18, 1894, with Joseph F. Smith acting as proxy for Joseph Smith, and Bathsheba W. Smith acting as proxy for James (who was not allowed into the temple for the ordinance). In the ceremony, James was [...] "attached as a Servitor for eternity to the prophet Joseph Smith and in this capacity be connected with his family and be obedient to him in all things in the Lord as a faithful Servitor".|$|E
500|$|None of {{his critics}} could make charges of {{corruption}} stick. Senator Morton {{was among the}} earliest to refuse any share in the so-called [...] "back pay" [...] that Congress awarded its members in 1873, and returned his money to the U.S. Treasury {{as soon as it}} was given to him. Morton was untouched by the Crédit Mobilier scandal. A hostile Democratic House scoured the official files for some evidence of bribe-taking or shakedowns in awarding Civil War contracts, and came up empty-handed. For others, despite holding many positions that angered his opponents, Morton was highly regarded for remaining clean of graft during the war period when corruption was commonplace. For his honest conduct he was offered the thanks of the Indiana General Assembly and others on numerous occasions. After Morton learned that President Grant had nominated his son, John M. Morton, for Registrar of the Land Office in Dakota Territory, the Senator immediately wrote <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> the selection be withdrawn, protest that he could not afford to have any relative appointed to any political office.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to East Francia and Moravia, the first Bulgarian Empire {{was the third}} power {{deeply involved in the}} Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. A late 10th-century Byzantine lexicon known as Suda adds that Krum of Bulgaria attacked the Avars from the southeast around 803. [...] The Royal Frankish Annals narrates that the Abodrites inhabiting [...] "Dacia on the Danube" [...] (most probably along the lower courses of the river Tisza) sought the assistance of the Franks against the Bulgars in 824. Bulgarian troops also invaded Pannonia, [...] "expelled the Slavic chieftains and appointed Bulgar governors instead" [...] in 827. An inscription at Provadia refers to a Bulgarian military leader named Onegavonais drowning in the Tisza around the same time. The emerging power of Moravia brought about a rapprochement between Bulgaria and East Francia in the 860s. For instance, King Arnulf of East Francia sent an embassy to the Bulgarians in 892 in order [...] "to renew the former peace and <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> they should not sell salt to the Moravians". The latter request suggests that the route from the salt mines of the Eastern Carpathians to Moravia was controlled around that time by the Bulgarians.|$|E
