In 1961, he used the car for the first 8-second run in NHRA national event history, when his 8.99 second pass beat Dick Rea in the Top Eliminator (<b>Top</b> <b>Gas)</b> final at the first Winternationals. That summer he drove to a 8.78 e.t. at Caddo Mills, Texas, which was the lowest e.t. of the year.

40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{evaluation}} of gas hydrate resources is lack of a reliable technique to constrain the <b>top</b> occurrence of <b>gas</b> hydrates. We have developed a numerical model of the <b>top</b> occurrence of <b>gas</b> hydrates based on that the depleted quantity of sulfate diffusion downward equals to that of methane flux upward at sulfate-methane interface (SMI) and the methane solubility in the water-hydrate system, using steady state and analytical expressions. In situ methane production and sulfate depletion associated with the oxidation of sedimentary organic matter were considered in the model. We applied this model to ODP site 1245 and IODP site 1327, and calculated the <b>top</b> of <b>gas</b> hydrate occurrence at these two sites, yielding 53 mbsf, 83 mbsf, respectively, which {{are consistent with the}} top depth estimated by drilling...|$|R

(Thus, they were technically [...] "funny gassers", not fuel cars, unlike the later examples.)
