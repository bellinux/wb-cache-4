5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|In March 1940, {{two months}} before the start of World War II in Belgium, Bob, his second child, was born. When the first tribulations of the war were over, Vandersteen could restart his work at L'Innovation. From November 1940 until August 1942, he created his first {{published}} comic, Kitty Inno, for the company, consisting of short, simple gags. When the German occupier forbade the publication of American and British comics in the Belgian newspapers and magazines, opportunies arose for local people. On 19 March 1941, the first comic strip of Tor de holbewoner (Tor the troglodyte) appeared in the newspaper De Dag. It continued until January 1942. Already on 26 March 1941 it was joined by De lollige avonturen van Pudifar (<b>The</b> <b>funny</b> adventures of Pudifar), a weekly comic strip about a cat. This was in May of the same year replaced by Barabitje, another comic about a cat, which ended in October 1941.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{performers}} {{of the earlier}} Broadway version of the Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including Fanny Brice and Harriet Hoctor, the ballet dancer and contortionist. The Great Ziegfeld marked Rainer's second Hollywood film role after Escapade (also with Powell).

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a pun. It refers to both {{cartoonist}} Rube Goldberg, who {{was famous for}} his drawings of incredibly complex machines made out of everyday objects that performed rudimentary tasks, {{as well as the}} harpsichord piece, the [...] "Goldberg Variations", by Johann Sebastian Bach. The elaborate contraptions Henry Weems created are physical examples of such machines. Episode writer Jeffrey Bell noted that he wanted the episode to function [...] "as a Rube Goldberg device" [...] and so he wrote the story to revolve around the ideas of good luck and bad luck. Originally, the episode's opening scene was to have featured Weems falling thirty thousand feet from an airplane and walking away unscathed. Although Bell's pitch was met with enthusiasm, many writers and producers for the show were cautious, because they realized the episode would have several humorous moments. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained: [...] "The episode had a lot of humorous moments that we were afraid of doing because as many people who like <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> ones hate <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> ones." [...] Eventually, the episode was green-lighted, but pushed to later in the season because, according to Spotnitz, [...] "we wanted to scare the hell out of everybody during the first few episodes." ...|$|E
