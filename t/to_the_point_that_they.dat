5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At {{the time}} of his sudden death after 34 years at the helm of Analog, Campbell's quirky {{personality}} and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> no longer submitted works to him.|$|E
5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E

5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license.

Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play {{in a way that would}} shock audiences without disturbing them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not recommend it to friends.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the rumored signing, Neuer was signed by the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the New York State League. He made his {{professional}} debut on July 27, 1905, and threw a one-hit shutout against the Syracuse Stars. He pitched for Wilkes-Barre {{the rest of the}} season. In his final game for them, he pitched both games of a doubleheader, winning one and losing the other. In 1906, Wilkes-Barre planned to re-sign Neuer, praising his hitting ability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were considering trying him out as an outfielder or first baseman. They were unable to agree on a contract, and as a result he sat out the 1906 season.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ {{and the fact that it}} comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E

5|$|The Birth of a Nation, Gone {{with the}} Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all {{increased}} their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes {{revenue from the}} late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avatar—as the current record-holder—includes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run) along {{with all of its}} revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to The Sound of Music in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. The Sound of Music, The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.|$|E

25|$|Protein {{purification}} {{is either}} preparative or analytical. Preparative purifications aim {{to produce a}} relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes (e.g. lactase), nutritional proteins (e.g. soy protein isolate), and certain biopharmaceuticals (e.g. insulin). Analytical purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein {{for a variety of}} research or analytical purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the protein's structure, post-translational modifications and function. Pepsin and urease were the first proteins purified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be crystallized.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{patients}} are often discharged without sufficient preparation or support. A {{greater proportion of}} people with mental disorders become homeless or go to prison. Families can often {{play a crucial role}} in the care of those who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.|$|E
25|$|The correlatives, {{although}} clearly cognate with European languages (for example, kiel, tiel with French quel (which), tel (such); ĉiu with Italian ciascun (each), and -es {{with the}} German genitive -es, etc.), have been analogically leveled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are often given {{as examples of}} Esperanto innovations. This {{is especially true for}} the indefinite forms like io (something), which were devised by iconically removing the consonant of the ki- and ti- forms. Likewise, the restriction of the Italian and Greek masculine noun and adjective ending -o to nouns, and the feminine noun and adjective ending -a to adjectives and the article la, is an Esperanto innovation using existing forms.|$|E
