5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet {{while on the}} ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

Not knowing {{anyone else in the}} city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E

5|$|Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation is a 1986 Canadian-American {{animated}} fantasy film {{produced by}} LBS Communications, Inc. and Nelvana. The third animated feature from Nelvana, it {{was directed by}} Dale Schott, written by Peter Sauder and produced by Nelvana's three founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It stars the voices of Alyson Court, Cree Summer, Maxine Miller and Hadley Kay. In the second film based on the Care Bears franchise, a character called The Great Wishing Star (voiced by Chris Wiggins) tells {{the origins of the}} Care Bears, and the story of their first Caring Mission. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse lead the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, as <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aid of Christy, a young camper who is tempted by an evil shape-shifting figure named Dark Heart. This is also the first appearance of the Care Bear Cubs, who also had their own line of toys.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E

25|$|Many Haredim who {{subscribe}} to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization {{is that they do}} so only as individuals and families, but not as members of the organized mass-immigration, and that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land solely to live there, not in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.|$|E

The two of them now live a calm, dispassionate life of moderately-paid public service. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts {{that he has done}} no wrong yet, they remind him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred.|$|E
25|$|Noticing {{that all}} sinkholes are connected, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} that the biggest hydra {{must be in the}} center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E
25|$|Cetacean {{surfacing}} behaviour is a {{group of}} behaviours demonstrated by the Cetacea infraorder when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive, and some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting. In addition to respiration, cetaceans have developed and used surface behaviours for many other functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order Cetacea, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. Cetacea is usually split into two suborders, Odontoceti and Mysticeti, based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, Cetacea can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all Odontocetes less than 10 m long including orca) as many behaviours are correlated with size. Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular tourism industry.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister awkwardly {{tries to}} {{entertain}} Grey Worm and Missandei {{while waiting for}} Varys. Varys arrives and explains that he has discovered that the slave masters of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis have been financing the Sons of the Harpy. Grey Worm notes that the Unsullied have taken Astapor and Yunkai once before, but Tyrion warns him that marching on the cities will leave Meereen defenseless. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion {{that the only way}} to defeat the Sons of the Harpy is to hunt them down. Tyrion asks Varys to send his [...] "little birds" [...] (street children who act as spies and messengers) to deliver a message to the leaders of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis.|$|E
500|$|Brendon, Melissa, and Jason {{decide to}} start {{screening}} their movies {{in front of}} a focus group that consists of their schoolmates Fenton, Junior, Perry, and Walter. The group members harshly criticize this latest movie, {{and in the midst of}} trying to find the flaw in it, the three friends discover that the first movie they ever made together ‚Äî in which they are a biker gang contemplating whether or not to fight an unknown adversary ‚Äî is missing an ending. The three cannot agree on a conclusion for the movie, so they decide that each of them will create their own, and then screen the three potential endings in front of the focus group. All of their endings, however, are harshly criticized. The three sit down and watch a reel composed of scenes from several of their film projects; <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> consensus that their movies are designed only for them and should not actually be seen by anyone else.|$|E
500|$|Elements of {{the book}} were rewritten while several songs {{underwent}} minor transformations. This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us. We learned a lot from the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics make up their minds before <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre." [...] On October 30, 2003, the musical opened on Broadway.|$|E

2500|$|Cortright, on {{the other}} hand, has {{reviewed}} the field of transpersonal psychotherapy and the major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, including Wilber, Jung, Washburn, Grof and Ali, as well as [...] existential, psychoanalytic, and body-centered approaches. He also presents a unifying theoretical framework for the field of Transpersonal Psychotherapy, and identifies the dimension of human consciousness as central to the transpersonal realm. He also addresses clinical issues related to meditation, spiritual emergency, and altered states of consciousness. According to commentators Cortright challenges the traditional view, of Transpersonal Psychology, that a working through of psychological issues is necessary for progression on the spiritual path. Instead he suggests that these two lines of development are intertwined, and that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreground with shifting emphasis.|$|E
