50|$|Many {{techniques}} such as carrier recovery, clock recovery, <b>bit</b> <b>slip,</b> frame synchronization, rake receiver, pulse compression, Received Signal Strength Indication, error detection and correction, etc., are only performed by demodulators, although any specific demodulator may perform only some or none of these techniques.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} allow users to use {{handheld}} devices accessing video information, such as downloading and playing video files, {{there is a need}} to downscale the compressed video into lower spatial resolution and lower <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate. In this work, transcoding the compressed H. 263 video into low spatial-resolution is discussed and realized. To reduce the computation cost, motion vectors from the incoming video stream are resampled and reused. We propose a novel approach to refine motion vectors adaptively according to the motion of every frame or every macroblock in a frame. The proposed approach can improve the video quality and reduce predictive residues of every frame, hence reduce the <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate. Implementation results suggest that the proposed approach produces better image quality and lower <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate than a number of previous approaches...|$|R
50|$|One way to {{maintain}} timing between transmitting and receiving devices is to employ an asynchronous protocol such as start-stop. Alternatively, <b>bit</b> <b>slip</b> can be prevented by using a self-clocking signal (such as a signal modulated using OQPSK) or using a line coding such as Manchester encoding.|$|R

The algorithm is used for robust transmission of progressively compressed 3 D models over a packet erasure channel. In contrast to the previous approach, which uses exhaustive search, the time complexity of our algorithm is linear in the <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> budget. 1...|$|R
40|$|Key words: two {{dimensional}} (2 D) chaos-based encryption scheme, clinical electroencephalography, <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> error rate, parallel processing, mobile telemedicine. In this paper, {{we have developed}} a two-dimensional (2 D) chaos-based encryption scheme {{that can be applied}} to signals with <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> errors in clinical electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile telemedicine. As opposed to one-dimensional (1 D) chaos-based encryption, the proposed 2 D schemes uses the concept of parallel processing to increase the encryption speed. An essential feature of the proposed scheme is that signals mapping of a 2 D chaotic scrambler and a permutation scheme are used to obtain clinical EEG information that re-quires high-level encryption. Simulation results show that when the correct deciphering parameters are inputted, EEG signals with a <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> error rate (BER) of 10 - 7 are completely recovered. However, these signals can not be recovered if there is an error in the input parameters, for ex-ample, an initial point error of 0. 00000001 %. I...|$|R

Each <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> block is divided into a main block Hn having at least the most important code words and an auxiliary block Sn comprising the other code words. By carrying out a formatting operation, a group of <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> blocks is converted into a channel bit block consisting of a number of sub-channel bit blocks SCBn of equal length. The main blocks are accommodated at the first bit positions of the sub-channel bit blocks and the bits of the auxiliary blocks are spread over the remaining bit positions. It is thereby achieved that the most important information is always found at fixed locations so that the influence of sync losses is reduced considerably...|$|R

Moreover, we have analyzed the flexible configuration changes as well as higher capacity and maximum possible <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rates. Also in the same way, we have developed OADMs, which are capable of dealing with one to several channels arbitrarily selected.

40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} the optimal zero-forcing {{transceiver}} that maximizes the <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The <b>transmission</b> <b>bit</b> rate is maximized {{subject to a}} total power constraint for a given error rate. Instead of using the same input constellation size for all subchannels as in earlier designs, the bit allocation is also taken into consideration. The bit allocation and the zero-forcing transceiver are jointly designed for bit rate maximization. The optimal transceiver is obtained in a closed form. The bits are allocated according to the subchannel {{signal to noise ratio}}s. The larger the signal to noise ratio is, the more the number of bits are allocated. In the simulation, we have demonstrated that a higher bit rate can be achieved compared to previously reported methods. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{receiver}} {{does not}} control the data rate, so it must avoid <b>bit</b> <b>slip</b> by synchronizing its reception with the source clock. Many S/PDIF implementations cannot fully decouple the final signal from influence of the source or the interconnect. Specifically the process of clock recovery used to synchronize reception may produce jitter. If the DAC {{does not have a}} stable clock reference then noise will be introduced into the resulting analog signal. However, receivers can implement various strategies that limit this influence.|$|R
