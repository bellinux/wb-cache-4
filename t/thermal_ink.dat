The characteristic of <b>thermal</b> <b>ink</b> is that its color value will change in real time as the temperature changes.

We get the color information from the segmentation area (thermal ink); through the ink color value of correction and the comparison of the standard color, the right color value is concluded, and finally, temperature is output by the relevance of the <b>thermal</b> <b>ink</b> color and temperature. This design can be used for measuring the indoor, outdoor temperature, and food labels, etc. It can also be used to control the temperature of greenhouse plants. We identify the change of temperature through real-time monitoring of the color change, thereby adjust the temperature to obtain a better yield.

In the 90 s, color is becoming easier and less expensive to use and its application is moving from isolated color pages toward integrated color documents.

Business applications cover a range of quality requirements for both full and highlight color documents.

30|$|Color {{information}} {{plays an}} important role in the color image segmentation and real-time color sensor, which affects the result of video image segmentation and correct real-time temperature value. In this paper, a novel real-time color image segmentation method is proposed, which is based on color similarity in RGB color space. According to the color and luminance information in RGB color space, the dominant color is determined at first, and then color similarity can be calculated with the proposed calculation method of color component, which creates a color-class map. Next, the information of the corresponding color-class map is utilized to classify the pixels. Due to the characteristic that thermal inks feature color values that change in real time as the temperature changes, the segmentation results of <b>thermal</b> <b>ink</b> can be used as a real-time color sensor. Then, we also propose a method of color correction and light source compensation for the sake of potential inaccuracy of its measures. We discuss the proposed segmentation method application combining with color sensor (<b>thermal</b> <b>ink)</b> in real-time color image segmentation for Cyber physical system (CPS) by the application in fire detection and summarize a new method in identifying fire in a video based on these characteristics. The experiments showed that the proposed method in vision-based fire detection and identification in videos was effective; the results were accurate and can be used in real-time analysis.|$|E

In the first step, we made polyester by polycondensing 1, 6 -hexanediol and adipic acid. The resulting polymers had carboxylic acid, which was linked with polyamine via an acid-base reaction. We then characterized the polyester-polyamine structure by NMR spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). We also determined the basic char-acterizations such as total acid numbers (TAN) (5. 0 − 67. 5 mgKOH/g), hydroxyl values (27. 1 − 67. 5 mgKOH/g), and molar masses (Mn = 1. 6 − 8. 4 kg mol − 1) for the polyester and total base numbers (TBN) (15. 3 − 57. 1 mgKOH/g), hydroxyl values (33. 0 − 79. 8 mgKOH/g), and nitrogen contents (1. 02 − 3. 48 %) for the polyester-polyamine polymers.

To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, {{and to provide}} local employment opportunities for graduating students, Frederick Terman proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the Stanford Industrial Park (later Stanford Research Park) in the year 1951. Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was Varian Associates, founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found venture capital for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was Hewlett-Packard. Founded in Packard's garage by Stanford graduates William Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis.

The inks were then ejected at room temperature on standard paper by means of either a <b>thermal</b> <b>ink</b> jet head (TIJ; sample A) or a piezoelectric ink jet head (PIJ; sample B). Magnetic properties of prints on paper (FC/ZFC curves, isothermal magnetic loops and related hysteretic properties) were measured between 10 and 300 K using an alternating gradient force magnetometer up to 20 kOe. The inks display a different magnetic behavior with respect to both prints.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} and applied engineering knowledge required issues to develop stable and functional bioactive papers and paper fluidic devices {{for health and}} environmental diagnostics were investigated. Bioactive papers {{are designed to be}} wetted by a biofluid or some solution of interest; biomolecule retention and behaviour on paper must be maximized. Two enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were directly physisorbed on paper or retained on paper with a polymer. Three model polymers were investigated: a high molecular weight cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), an anionic polyacryilc acid (PAA) or a high molecular weight polyethylene oxide (PEO). The reactivity and the thermal stability of enzymatic bioactive papers were quantified using an advanced colorimetric technique. The enzymes adsorbed on paper retained their functionality and selectivity. Adsorption on paper increased the enzyme thermal stability by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the same enzyme in solution. The thermal degradation of the adsorbed enzyme follows two sequential first order reactions, indication of a reaction system. The model polymers used as retention aids were efficient at increasing the enzyme concentration on paper (by 50 %) and to prevent enzyme desorption/leaching upon the rewetting of the paper. The polymers affect the thermal stability and the aging of ALP enzyme on paper; the rapid initial deactivation becomes predominant, while it was negligible for the enzyme simply physisorbed on paper. As a result, the thermal stability significantly decreases. A mathematical model predicting the enzymatic paper’s half-life time was developed. The reaction kinetics of ALP enzymatic paper reacting with its substrate was measured and shown to follow a first order reaction with respect to the enzyme concentration. ALP immobilized on paper has a reaction rate 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the free ALP in buffer solution. No increase in reaction rate was achieved by immobilizing ALP on paper with polymer as retention aids; this suggests that enzyme orientation was not significantly affected through preferentially linking with its anionic or cationic groups. Paper bioassays to identify antigens and antibodies in a biofluid, such as blood, were investigated. Two series of experiments were performed. In the first, blood samples were mixed with different amounts of antibodies and a droplet of the mixture was deposited onto a paper strip. Agglutinated blood phase separated, with the red blood cells forming a distinct spot upon contact with paper while the serum wicked; in contrast, stable blood wicked uniformly. In the second series, blood droplets were deposited onto the paper strips pretreated with solutions of antibodies. The wicking of blood droplets on paper strips was characterized. Blood agglutination by interaction with a specific antibody caused a chromatographic separation. The concept of blood typing using a paper diagnostic was demonstrated with a prototype. The feasibility of <b>thermal</b> <b>ink</b> jet printing was demonstrated for the precise deposition of biomolecules on paper and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) with a protein (albumin-FITC) and an enzyme (HRP) as model biomolecules. Complex patterns of HRP and albumin-FITC were ink jet printed on paper. Microfluidic channels were also printed on paper to demonstrate the concept of paper based bioassays as diagnostic devices. Discreet and continuous concentration gradients of proteins on PCL scaffolds were achieved by ink jet printing; these protein concentration gradients can serve as potential guidance cues for cell growth generation in tissue engineering. Ink jet printing of biomolecules onto paper involves liquid-liquid interaction; acceptance of biomolecules on the porous surface is rather affected by the solid-liquid interaction. Both phenomena reduce print resolution. The liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interaction were quantified and modelled for sessile droplets. Satellite drops from the ink jet nozzle can form non-coalescence droplets (NCD), due to liquid-liquid interaction, and roll from their target. The Weber number (We) of falling liquid drops was used to quantify the NCD generation. To quantify the solid-liquid interaction, the liquid wicking of a droplet impacting an open V-groove at different velocities (groove angle, β= 60 º, 90 º, 120 º) was studied. A new mathematical model was developed to calculate liquid wicking distance in V-groove. The dynamics of wetting of sessile liquid droplets impinging, at different impact velocities, a groove surface (120 º) was investigated experimentally. The dynamics of V-groove wicking and wetting is important to optimize paper for ink jet printing and microfluidic devices.

Such a printing ink produced a high quality print which offered the required fastness properties of a textile print whilst maintaining a soft fabric handle. The cross-linking mechanism/properties of the Synthappret BAP were fully characterised. It was found that Synthappret BAP underwent rapid self cross-linking at elevated temperatures. There was no significant evidence of the cross-linking of the Synthappret BAP and the textile fibres. However, the Synthappret BAP was capable of (a) diffusing into the fibre matrix and (b) entrapping the pigment particles, thus, successfully fixing the pigment to the substrate.

The brief from Royal Mail was ‘Show us magic, and make it magical’. Building on his award-winning work for Royal Mail (Jet Travel, 1999), Hardie, with his collaborators (Tatham and Griffiths) researched types of magic from escapology to illusion and explored the translation of these to a stamp format. Royal Mail suggested the use of <b>thermal</b> and metal <b>inks</b> as a means to create ‘magic’ and encourage public engagement. Pursuing a central idea that the stamps would have tricks hidden within them, Hardie’s design process included iconic pencil sketches of card and coin tricks, and rabbits and hats. Hardie also established a set of design rules: • what images all refer to conjuring, magic, tricks and puzzles; • technical tricks would enhance these narratives; and • no additional equipment would be required to conduct the magic other than a mirror, water, magnet, finger scribble. Hardie’s role was to collaborate in the design process and develop the images. This innovative set of stamps used heat-sensitive inks, scratch card technology and optical tricks.

The ability of fulgides and fulgimides to interconvert between two key forms by irradiation of different wavelength of light {{has made them}} promising material in optical memory devices, optical switches and sensors, and specialty dyes and <b>inks.</b> <b>Thermal</b> stability and hydrolytic stability of fulgides and fulgimides are essential for their practical applications. A deuterated trifluoromethyl indolylfulgide was synthesized based on the synthetic pathway of the proteo trifluoromethyl indolylfulgide using commercially available deuterated starting materials. Deuteration of the isopropylidene group improved the thermal stability of the indolylfulgide {{by a factor of}} 7. ^ Fulgimides are the most important fulgide derivatives. Fulgimides improve the hydrolytic stability of fulgides by replacing the succinic anhydride ring with a succinimide ring. A novel trifluoromethyl N-ethoxycarbonylmethyl indolylfulgimide was synthesized from trifluoromethyl indolylfulgide. The trifluoromethyl indolylfulgide was synthesized on a large scale in five steps with an overall yield of 18 %. The indolylfulgide was then converted to indolylfulgimide by aminolysis follow by dehydration. The N-ethoxycarbonylmethyl indolylfulgimide showed enhanced hydrolytic stability and photochemical stability in 70 / 30 ethanol/water. ^ Three novel aqueous soluble fulgimides, trifluoromethyl carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide, dicarboxylic acid indolylfulgimide, and H-carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide, were synthesized. In sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) at 37 ºC, an unusual hydrolysis of the trifluoromethyl group of the closed form of the carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide resulted in the dicarboxylic acid indolylfulgimide which has an additional carboxylic acid group. The closed form of dicarboxylic acid indolylfulgimide was further decarboxylated to generate H-carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide which was not photochromic. The trifluoromethyl dicarboxylic acid indolylfulgimide is the most robust fulgimide yet reported in aqueous solution. ^ A novel aqueous soluble methyl carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide was synthesized from methyl indolylfulgide. The methyl indolylfulgide was synthesized in five steps with an overall yield of 21 %. The methyl carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide was synthesized by aminolysis follow by dehydration. The methyl carboxylic acid indolylfulgimide is expected to have improved thermal and photochemical stability in aqueous solutions relative to the trifluoromethyl analog. ...|$|R
40|$|Aspects {{relating}} {{to and including}} the development of thick film screen printed CO 2 sensors were investigated. Modified sensor structures with potential for prevent- ing sensor degradation due to humidity and solid electrolyte/alumina substrate interaction have been developed and hence tested. Sensor testing characteristics such as the response and recovery times, repeatability and importantly sensor stability and humidity cross-sensitivity were thus determined and investigated. Firstly, in the quest to {{lower the cost of}} sensor production, new and superior synthesis procedures for sensor components (NASICON-solid electrolyte and CuAlO 2 -oxygen buffer) have been developed which require low <b>thermal</b> input. Bespoke <b>inks</b> from the functional powders were also developed. Sintering schedule optimisation of the NASICON thick films demonstrated that 1100 °C for 60 minutes was the optimal recipe to obtaining a perfectly sintered NASICON film. To investigate the electrical properties of NASICON having commonly used electrode configurations in sensors, the effect of film thickness and film electrode configurations on electrical properties was explored. No significant dependence on thickness at high temperatures is observed while lower temperature conductivity is dominated by extrinsic behaviour. The film whose electrode configuration was in a basal plane showed superior conductivity properties than when the electrodes were place across the film. Thermodynamics of reference electrodes using the EMF method using cells (-) Pt, NT 6 -TiO 2 (or NT 6 - NT 3) | NASICON | (α + β) - Al 2 O 3, Pt(+) revealed new information that may have been ignored by other workers; the existence of two temperature regimes and phase transformation of Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 to higher(lower sodium content) titanates (Na 2 Ti 7 O 15 and Na 2 Ti 9 O 19). This data presents the first indications from EMF thermodynamic studies for the possible transformation as was proposed by other workers. Three types of sensor structures were developed; (a) the conventional planar sensor architecture(PSA) - fabricated by printing sensing and reference electrodes {{side by side on the}} electrolyte (b) the modified planar sensor architecture(M-PSA) - a PSA with an oxygen buffer material deposited on top of the reference electrode and (c) a multi-layered structure referred to as stacked sensor architecture (SSA) - fabricated by first depositing the oxygen buffer on the alumina substrate followed by the reference electrode then NASICON and finally the sensing electrode. A new sensing material combination (Na 2 CO 3 -Li 2 CO 3 -BaCO 3) used on the PSA improved sensing response and recovery times of the sensors as well as sensor stability. The new sensing electrodes were used in the multi-layered structure (SSA) and performed just as well in terms of response and recovery times as well as stability. Both the modified sensors(M-PSA and SSA) demonstrated long term signal stability as well as humidity immunity. The sensors also demonstrated that they could operate even at as low a temperature as 225 °C and sensor performance improved as the operating temperature was increased demonstrating how wide a temperature they can operate at. The measurements in this study were done up to 430 °C. Furthermore, since the CO 2 concentrations measured were < 500 ppm, it demonstrates how robust the sensors are as they were responsive to such low concentration changes...|$|R
