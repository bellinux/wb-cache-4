25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being electrically heated, the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's <b>true</b> <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{discharge}} plasma {{was used}} to activate air to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for promoting the oxidation of ammonium sulfite by air forced oxidation method.
