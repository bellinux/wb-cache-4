40|$|OBJECTIVES:The {{effects of}} two humate {{products}} {{were compared to}} that of prednisolone on a contact hypersensitivity rat model. METHODS: Rats, sensitized with dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), were placed on a daily oral treatment of 61 mg/kg BW of humate derived from either leonardite or bituminous coal or on prednisolone at one mg/kg BW and challenged 6 days later with a topical application of DNFB to the right ear. The inflamed ears were measured daily. In a toxicity study rats were exposed to daily oral treatment of leonardite humate at 1, 000 mg/kg BW for 1 month. A <b>teratogenicity</b> <b>study</b> was done where pregnant rats were treated with 500 mg/kg BW on days 5 to 17 of pregnancy. RESULTS: Only the leonardite humate compared favourably with prednisolone in suppressing contact hypersensitivity. No signs of toxicity were observed and weight gain was normal during the 6 -day and 1 month treatments and during the <b>teratogenicity</b> <b>study</b> with the leonardite humate. However, the rats on the other two products experienced slower weight gain. CONCLUSION: The identification of a naturally occurring nontoxic compound with anti-inflammatory activity is exciting and merits further evaluation in the treatment of patients suffering from inflammatory conditions...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{drug use}} in pregnancy, and compare drug use of pregnant women with non-pregnant women with respect to possible <b>teratogenicity.</b> <b>Study</b> design: A cross-sectional study based on pharmacy records from 1997 to 2001 was performed. Pregnant women and matched non-pregnant women (same physician and age) were identified. Prescriptions were set against the Australian risk classification. Results: Thirty-five percent of all prescriptions for non-pregnant women were safe in pregnancy (Australian classification A), in 14 % the risk was unknown (B 1, B 2), 49 % were potentially harmful drugs (B 3, C, D, X), and in 3 % no classification was available. For pregnant women these figures were 86, 3, 10 and 2 %, respectively. In non-pregnant women the highest percentages of prescriptions for unsafe drugs were for psycholeptics (99 % not classified as safe), psychoanaleptics (100 %), anti-inflammatory/antirheumetic products (100 %), antihistamines (94 %), antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (81 %), antiepileptics (100 %), beta-blockers (100 %), systemic antimycotics (100 %), antiprotozoals (97 %), diuretics (100 %) and immunosuppressives (100 %). In pregnant women this pattern was comparable, except for antihistamines (22 %) and antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (3 %). Conclusion: We conclude that many drugs used by non-pregnant women should be avoided in pregnancy, and that pregnant women indeed do so. However, for some drug groups the available safe alternatives are limited. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the safety and anti-inflammatory and wound healing characteristics of carbohydrate derived fulvic acid (CHD-FA) in rats. A daily oral dosage of CHD-FA at 100 mg/kg and higher effectively reduced carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats which was comparable to an oral dosage of 10 mg/kg indomethacin. Furthermore, the topical application of CHD-FA formulated to contain 1. 75 % active product in an cetomicrogol cream at pH 1. 98, compared favourably with fusidic acid cream (10 mg/g) in accelerating the healing of excised wounds infected with S. aureus. No signs of toxicity were observed in rats during the 6 -day acute and 6 month chronic oral treatment with CHD-FA at 100 mg/Kg bodyweight. Topical application of CHD-FA, formulated in UEA cream and applied to the right ears of mice at 400 mg/Kg bodyweight on days one, and 7 to 38 produced no adverse events. No signs of toxicity were observed in the <b>teratogenicity</b> <b>study</b> where CHD-FA was administered at 100 mg/kg bodyweight to pregnant female mice by gavage 3 days before fertilization to 14 days of pregnancy.

Appropriate animal models are needed to test potentially harmful effects and mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity of various chemical substances.

40|$|Summary—A {{critical}} and {{comprehensive review of}} the safety information on erythritol was undertaken. Numerous toxicity and metabolic {{studies have been conducted}} on erythritol in rats, mice and dogs. The toxicity studies consist of long-term feeding studies conducted to determine carcinogenic potential, intravenous and oral <b>teratogenicity</b> <b>studies</b> to determine the potential for eects on the foetus, oral stu-dies in which erythritol was administered over one or two generations to determine the potential for reproductive eects, and studies in bacterial and mammalian systems to determine mutagenic potential. The majority of the safety studies conducted were feeding studies in which erythritol was mixed into the diet at concentrations as high as 20 %. The metabolic studies in animals have shown that erythritol is almost completely absorbed, not metabolized systemically and is excreted unchanged in the urine. The safety studies have demonstrated that erythritol is well tolerated and elicits no toxicological eects. The clinical program for erythritol involved a series of single-dose and repeat-dose, short-duration stu-dies which have been used to investigate the human correlates to the physiological responses seen in the preclinical studies. The clinical studies showed erythritol to be well tolerated and not to cause any toxi-cologically relevant eects, even following high-dose exposure.

Mild deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme of folate-dependent homocysteine metabolism, is common {{due to a}} polymorphism at bp 677, and may influence response to VPA. To examine interactions between VPA and MTHFR in vivo and in vitro, VPA-induced <b>teratogenicity</b> was <b>studied</b> in Mthfr -deficient mice, {{and the effects of}} VPA on MTHFR expression in HepG 2 cells were investigated. Mthfr+/+ and Mthfr+/- pregnant mice were injected with VPA on gestational day 8. 5; resorption rates and occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) were examined on gestational day 14. 5. MTHFR expression in HepG 2 cells was studied by promoter assays, quantitative RT-PCR and Western analysis. Mthfr+/+ mice had increased resorption rates (36 %) after VPA treatment, compared to saline treatment (10 %), whereas resorption rates were similar with Mthfr+/- mice with the 2 treatments (25 - 27 %). NTDs were only observed in one group (VPA-treated Mthfr+/+). VPA increased activity of both MTHFR promoters (1. 8 - and 3. 5 -fold), and levels of MTHFR mRNA and protein (2. 5 - and 3. 7 -fold, respectively) in HepG 2 cells. Consistent with MTHFR upregulation in vitro, plasma homocysteine decreased in mice one hour after VPA injection. VPA increases MTHFR expression and may have lower teratogenicity in MTHFR deficiency.

40|$|Background: Thalidomide was {{introduced}} in the 1950 s as a nontoxic sedative, but was removed from the market because of its <b>teratogenicity.</b> Recent <b>studies</b> have demonstrated that the most likely etiology of limb defects produced by fetal exposure to thalidomide is the inhibition of angiogenesis in the developing limb bud. Also many studies have shown that thalidomide inhibits tumor growth in several malignancies by the inhibition of VEGF. Methods: We determined whether the systemic administration of thalidomide inhibits colon cancer liver metastasis in mice. We also evaluated the optimal schedule of this treatment against murine colon cancer liver metastasis. Murine colon cancer CT- 26 cells were implanted into the spleens of BALB/c mice. 7 days after tumor implantation, the mice received an intra-peritoneal injection of thalidomide (0, 30 mg/kg) daily or every other day (3 times per week). After the treatments, all mice were sacrificed. The numbers of liver metastases were counted and the expression of VEGF and the micro vessel density were analyzed by immunohistochemistry against liver metastases. Results: 4 out of 10 mice which received a daily administration of thalidomide (30 mg/kg) died. But in this group, we found a significant {{reduction in the number of}} liver metastases compared with the control group (0 mg/kg). All mice which received thalidomide every other day survived. In this group, there was also a significant reduction in the number of liver metastases compared with the control. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed lower expressions of VEGF and CD 31 in the liver metastases of mice which received thalidomide every other day compared with the control. Conclusion: The systemic administration of thalidomide inhibits liver metastasis of colon cancer in mice by the downregulation of VEGF and angiogenesis. The every other day administration of thalidomide was the optimal schedule in this model.

At the end of chronic treatment period, the responsiveness of animals to myorelaxant effect of pancuronium, anesthetic activity of urethane and ketamine, serum sugar as well as transminase levels and Prothrombin time were examined. Chronic Phenytoin treatment resulted in a significant resistance to pancuronium and urethane effects, while no difference in other measured parameters was observed between Phenytoin received and respective control groups. Supplementation with any of the mentioned antioxidants significantly reversed the Phenytoin-induced alterations in animal’s responsiveness to pancuronium and urethane.

Many adults {{take some}} form of {{medication}} to treat chronic conditions, however {{little is known about}} their effects on embryogenesis and pregnancy. With the increase in fertility problems society is facing and the increase in use of medications, {{it is important to understand}} what effects pharmaceuticals have on the developing embryo to ensure that future generations are not adversely affected by teratogenic compounds that can lead to birth defects. In this <b>study,</b> <b>teratogenicity</b> of anti-diabetic compounds was examined using the in vitro P 19 C 5 embryoid body (EB) elongation morphogenesis model. As the EB model recapitulates key embryological events crucial for body patterning and axis formation, adverse impact of drugs on EB growth and elongation implicates their potential teratogenicity. Of the 31 anti-diabetic compounds examined, 27 decreased EB size and 11 either decreased or increased EB elongation at a given concentration. Morphogenetic impact of four specific anti-diabetic drugs, dapagliflozin, phenformin HCl, manidipine 2 HCl, and resveratrol, was further examined by investigating expression patterns of key developmental regulators. Each drug exhibited a unique effect on gene expression patterns. Notably, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the level of the Wnt 3 gene, a crucial regulator of the primitive streak formation. The Wnt-inhibiting effect of dapagliflozin was also confirmed by the TOPFLASH reporter assay. Furthermore, it was revealed that the drug impact on EB size was likely mediated by adverse effect on cell proliferation. These results suggest that anti-diabetic compounds impact EB morphogenesis by perturbing key developmental regulators, cellular signaling, and proliferation. The present research should lay the foundation for further investigations, including animal and human <b>studies,</b> to determine <b>teratogenicity</b> of specific anti-diabetes medications...|$|R
40|$|General {{consensus}} exists {{about the}} need to avoid drug intake as much as possible during pregnancy {{due to the lack of}} thorough evidence about the safety of pharmacologic treatments during gestation for both mothers and fetuses. In this respect, the overall safety profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnancy remains unclear. This article reviews current evidence about the safety of each SSRI during pregnancy in order to describe their specific teratogenic potential, with a particular focus on major and cardiovascular malformations, and to verify whether such toxicity can be considered as a class effect. The literature review included controlled studies and meta-analyses (retrieved using PsychINFO, EMBASE, and Medline from January 1966 to May 2010) from which the risk of major and/or cardiovascular malformations associated with a specific SSRI (ie, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, and fluvoxamine) could be estimated. Although there is evidence to support the association between birth defects and first-trimester exposure to paroxetine, findings from the studies reviewed suggest a teratogenic potential of the whole SSRI class, consistent with preclinical evidence. These teratogenic effects are mainly in the heart region, and they are often described as septal defects. It may be suggested that the higher frequency of teratogenic effects reported for paroxetine might depend on specific pharmacologic features of this drug compared with other SSRIs, although it is difficult to test this hypothesis. It is noteworthy that current evidence on SSRI <b>teratogenicity</b> stems from <b>studies</b> affected by several methodological weaknesses (ie, lack of investigations using control groups of untreated depressed mothers, confounding by indication, and recall bias). Accordingly, we are not yet able to rule out the possibility that positive associations, as determined in some studies, result from analyses of poor quality. © Postgraduate Medicine...|$|R

However, its use was discontinued because of a major drawback of causing <b>teratogenicity.</b> In this <b>study,</b> we found that a thalidomide derivative, 5 -hydroxy- 2 -(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) - 1 H-isoindole- 1, 3 -dione (5 HPP- 33), inhibited the proliferation of MCF- 7 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4. 5 +/- 0. 4 mu M. 5 HPP- 33 depolymerized microtubules and inhibited the reassembly of cold-depolymerized microtubules in MCF- 7 cells. Using time-lapse imaging, the effect of 5 HPP- 33 on the dynamics of individual microtubules in live MCF- 7 cells was analyzed. 5 HPP- 33 (5 mu M) decreased the rates of growth and shortening excursions by 34 and 33 %, respectively, and increased the time microtubules spent in the pause state by 92 % as {{compared to that of}} the vehicle-treated MCF- 7 cells. 5 HPP- 33 (5 mu M) reduced the dynamicity of microtubules by 62 % compared to the control. 5 HPP- 33 treatment reduced the distance between the two poles of a bipolar spindle, induced multipolarity in some of the treated cells, and blocked cells at mitosis. In vitro, 5 HPP- 33 bound to tubulin with a weak affinity. Vinblastine inhibited the binding of 5 HPP- 33 to tubulin, and 5 HPP- 33 inhibited the binding of BODIPY FL-vinblastine to tubulin. Further, a molecular docking analysis suggested that 5 HPP- 33 shares its binding site on tubulin with vinblastine.

40|$|Background: Prenatal vitamin use is {{recommended}} {{as a necessary}} supplement prior to conception and throughout pregnancy. Multivitamin use in early pregnancy can significantly reduce risks for birth defects: cardiovascular defects, limb defect, urinary tract abnormalities, orofacial clefts and neural tube defects (NTDs). Sixty-nine to seventy-eight percent of women take vitamins after pregnancy recognition, while only 23 - 35 % {{of women in the}} U. S. start to use vitamins before pregnancy recognition. Rates of NTDs by ethnicity demonstrate that Hispanics have the highest prevalence (4. 2 per 10, 000 births) than Non-Hispanics. (Non-Hispanic Black or African American: 3. 2 per 10, 000 births; Non-Hispanic Whites: 2. 6 per 10, 000 births). Objectives: To explore the prevalence rates of multivitamin use during pregnancy and to find out the predictors of vitamin use using an established cohort in New Mexico. Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis which used data from the “Safety of Medication and Perception of <b>Teratogenicity</b> (SMART) ” <b>study.</b> Patients in the SMART study were recruited from 5 University of New Mexico affiliated prenatal clinics. Patients were considered vitamin users if they took vitamins at least 4 times a week. Based on the different time exposure to vitamins, vitamin use was further categorized into three groups: pre-conceptional vitamin users, vitamin users after pregnancy recognition, and vitamin non-users. Chi square and ANOVA were used to identify potential predictors including sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle characteristics, medical and reproductive health, and medication use. For multivariate analysis, ordinal logistic regression and polychotomous logistic regression model were used. Results: Most pregnant women (71. 9 %) in the sample began to take vitamins regularly after pregnancy recognition. Earlier vitamin use in pregnancy was significantly associated with pregnancy planning independent of other maternal characteristics. Education level and health insurance status revealed a significant interaction with respect to vitamin use. Lastly, almost one third (32. 1 %) of women in this study had a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and 45. 0 % of women had at least one medical condition. Vitamin non-users {{were more likely to have}} experience of adverse pregnancy outcomes in prior pregnancies compared to women who used vitamin after pregnancy recognition. Implication: This study highlights the importance of promoting vitamin use in New Mexico in women of childbearing years prior to conception and in early pregnancy, given the finding that less than one third of women used vitamins during the pre-conceptional period. Public health strategies should also include the promotion of pregnancy planning. Pharmaceutical ScienceMastersUniversity of New Mexico.
