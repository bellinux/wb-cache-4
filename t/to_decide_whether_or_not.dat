After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene {{to come to his}} apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{progressive}} reforms advocated by McCreary and {{passed in the}} 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections, mandating direct primary elections, and allowing the state's counties to hold local option elections <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near {{the close of the}} session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E

5|$|While many {{soldiers}} were still arriving, {{the citizens of}} Benton held a meeting on August 14 <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they would resist the soldiers. Many argued against it, but approximately 75 men declared {{they were prepared to}} resist any military occupation of their part of Columbia County. These men were led by Jacob Schultz, Samuel Kline, and one person from Orangeville. Kline went south to the town {{to learn more about the}} soldiers in Bloomsburg. According to an account by Edward McHenry, the other members of the resistance were told to remain at home until news arrived from Bloomsburg. When the draft evaders discovered that the army coming from Bloomsburg was too strong to defeat, McHenry and 20 other draft evaders in the county escaped to North Mountain.|$|E
5|$|After {{two people}} find Chip Diller (David Tom), the {{president}} of the Pig Sigma fraternity, passed out, Veronica gets hired as a photographer for the Hearst newspaper. Logan (Jason Dohring) requests that Veronica stop looking into the serial rapist case, but she denies and they fight. The Hearst board of trustees is going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to shut down the fraternities, but an important member, Selma Rose, goes missing {{in the middle of the}} party. Dean O’Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) immediately believes that she’s gone missing, asking Veronica and Keith to help. Veronica speaks to one of the feminist Lilith House girls, while Keith speaks to Selma’s husband. Veronica poses as a reporter to get news from Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) on the case. Veronica speaks to Dick (Ryan Hansen), who says that Chip Diller had a Roman numeral easter egg implanted in his anus, and Veronica suspects the Lilith House girls.|$|E
5|$|Campaigning on a {{platform}} of progressive reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, to mandate direct primary elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to adopt prohibition. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E

50|$|One type of {{marriage}} that has declined is the shotgun marriage. This drop in rate is documented {{by the number}} of out-of-wedlock births that now commonly occur. Between 1965 and 1989, three-fourths of white out-of-wedlock births and three-fifths of black out-of-wedlock births could be explained by situations where the parents would have married in the past. This is because, prior to the 1970s, the norm was such that, should a couple have a pregnancy out of wedlock, marriage was inevitable. Cultural norms have since changed, giving women and men more agency <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> when they should get married.|$|R

25|$|When Pacific Mail proved {{unable to}} {{initiate}} its new packet {{service on the}} date stipulated in the June 1872 statute, Congress was obliged <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to cancel the subsidy. Gould seized on this issue to further his scheme of damaging the company's reputation. He organized a lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the subsidy, while Roach, concerned that without the subsidy Pacific Mail might be unable to meet its debts, lobbied for retaining it. Unknown to Roach, his trusted friend and adviser, the lawyer William E. Chandler who was acting as Roach's main Washington lobbyist, also had Gould as a client, {{a conflict of interest}} that encouraged Chandler's reticence. As a result, Roach's lobbying was ineffective at combating Gould's attempt to portray Roach as an unethical raider of the public purse.|$|E
25|$|With the {{bid offer}} expiry date of August 7 approaching, Clearly Canadian decided {{to extend its}} offer {{expiration}} date to August 19.

This extension caused further rifts between the two companies, with Sun-Rype claiming reason for the extension, while Clearly Canadian stayed focused on acquiring as many shares as possible.
