5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and may have had a similar build to <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white,</b> and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark has {{no known}} natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark {{is arguably the}} world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, {{and is one of}} the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, {{including}} fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans. The IUCN list <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark as a vulnerable species, while it is included in AppendixII of CITES.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{served as}} the {{flagship}} for the Jamestown Exposition in mid-1907, which commemorated the 300th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Jamestown colony. She later sailed with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> Fleet on a circumnavigation of the Earth to showcase the US Navy's growing fleet of blue-water-capable ships. After completing her service with <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> Fleet, Connecticut participated in several flag-waving exercises intended to protect American citizens abroad until she was pressed into service as a troop transport at the end of World War I to expedite the return of American Expeditionary Forces from France.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon is {{represented}} in the fossil record by teeth, vertebral centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the jaws of megalodon {{would have been more}} massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white,</b> which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than that of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white.</b> Its fins were proportional to its larger size.|$|E
5|$|Of all shark species, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is {{responsible}} for {{by far the largest}} number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a great white shark to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the pyramid. The diver destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and great white shark swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or {{likely to become}} extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{species such}} as <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, {{thresher}} shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms {{at the top of}} their underwater food chain. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{only a few}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four {{have been involved in}} a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white,</b> oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.|$|E

5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E

5|$|Tiger {{shark teeth}} are unique with very sharp, {{pronounced}} serrations and an unmistakable sideways pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the sharks life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter {{than those of}} a <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, however they are nearly as broad as the root as <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>whites</b> teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.|$|R
