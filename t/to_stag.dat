50|$|Parandrinae is a {{subfamily}} of the {{longhorn beetle}} family (Cerambycidae). This subfamily includes {{only a few}} genera. These beetles are very atypical for cerambycids, in that the antennae are quite short, and the tarsi have 5 easily visible segments; they are thus rather similar in appearance <b>to</b> <b>stag</b> beetles.|$|E

These beetles are commonly nocturnal and are attracted to light. The majority of the Prioninae whose biology is known are borers whose larvae feed on rotting wood or roots.|$|E

In the 1980s, {{the road}} was significantly simplified, widened and straightened, resulting in a new alignment {{to the south of}} NH 115B. The increased speeds of the improved route may have directly contributed to a significant number of tragic moose-vehicle collisions in recent years along that section.|$|E

[...] Fiene, however, incorrectly confuses several stories with this year. This appears {{to be one of them}} and is certainly Salinger's 1944 piece [...] "Total War Diary." [...] Salinger struggled with this piece, trying at first to avoid both the first person narrative and the diary format that the story eventually adopted.|$|E

50|$|The {{newspaper}} was established {{under the name}} Bare Facts in 1967. In 1968, the University was to move from its home in Battersea Park, South-West London, <b>to</b> <b>Stag</b> Hill, in Guildford, Surrey. Concerns were raised at a lunchtime Students Union meeting over troubles in communication between the students on each site while the move was in progress. Outgoing Union President, Bob Matthews, suggested a one-page newsletter covering both campuses, which would carry messages by clubs and societies, as well as general notices from the students' union. The first few hundred issues were usually edited by the Union Executive, before an annual editor was appointed.|$|E

Many of the corporation's trams were built in the depot during this time. It was converted to a bus depot in 1949, and was the head office of First Hampshire & Dorset. The site now belongs to Sainsburys Superstore, which opened in February 2012. The site includes a Customer Restaurant, Underground Parking, and Play Park as well as an enclosed delivery bay for the store. There is also space above for retail property or a library although this has yet to be finalised.|$|E

The cool bracken grove {{on the top of the}} hill, with the oak boughs for roof, where the pigeons were raising an endless wedding hymn, and the autumn, humming, whispered to the ears of lovers in the fern, while the deer stole by. The bracken grove of irretrievable delights, of golden minutes in the long {{marriage}} of heaven and earth! The bracken grove, sacred <b>to</b> <b>stags,</b> <b>to</b> strange tree-stump fauns leaping around the silver whiteness of a birch-tree nymph at summer dusk.|$|R
5000|$|Rhodes {{was born}} in Coalton, Jackson County, Ohio, to James and Susan Howe Rhodes, who were of Welsh descent. Rhodes has commented that the reason {{he and his family}} were Republicans was because of the respect his father, a mine superintendent, had for John L. Lewis, a {{prominent}} Republican union activist. When Rhodes was nine his father died and the family moved to north Springfield where Rhodes graduated from Springfield High School where he played on the football team. Subsequently, the family moved again, this time to Columbus, because Rhodes earned a modest basketball scholarship to The Ohio State University. Although Rhodes dropped out after his first quarter he is often described as a [...] "student" [...] or [...] "alumnus" [...] of Ohio State. After dropping out of college, Rhodes opened a business called Jim's Place across from the university on North High Street. Jim's Place {{has been described as a}} place where one could buy anything, from doughnuts and hamburgers, <b>to</b> <b>stag</b> films, or place bets on numbers games.|$|E
5000|$|Amos {{approached}} Atlantic Records in December 1990 with a 10-track demo tape, some being newer songs {{but mostly}} ones from June. The track listing consisted of [...] "Russia" [...] (later to become [...] "Take to the Sky"), [...] "Mary", [...] "Crucify", [...] "Happy Phantom", [...] "Leather", [...] "Winter", [...] "Sweet Dreams", [...] "Song for Eric", [...] "Learn to Fly" [...] and [...] "Flying Dutchman". Atlantic {{was unhappy with}} the songs, and in response Amos and her then boyfriend Eric Rosse recorded some new songs, including [...] "Girl", [...] "Precious Things", [...] "Tear In Your Hand" [...] and [...] "Little Earthquakes". The song [...] "Take Me With You" [...] was recorded during these sessions, but not released until 2006 (with re-recorded vocals.) This session was recorded on a limited budget in Rosse's home studio, using his 3M 24-track analog tape machine and a Yamaha CP-80 piano. Amos and Rosse also went <b>to</b> <b>Stag</b> Studios to use a Yamaha grand piano. Satisfied with these recordings, Atlantic determined that the album Little Earthquakes would have 13 tracks, removing [...] "Learning to Fly" [...] and adding four from the December recording session.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934, Scott and Tom Campbell Black {{were entered}} in the London to Melbourne Air Race, officially known as the [...] "MacRobertson Air Race", and also dubbed [...] "The world's Greatest Air race". The Great Air Race is still {{believed}} {{to be the most important}} air race that has ever taken place, because as well as attracting more publicity, worldwide organization and involvement than any other air race before or since, it stood to encourage the extension of an established air route to the British Empire's furthermost territory. This was not only thought to be highly beneficial as an air mail and passenger route, but would also enable troops and supplies to be quickly and efficiently moved to the area should there be any future military threats from South East Asia. Charles Scott and Campbell Black had met one year previously to the start of the race at a cocktail party at the Royal Aero Club in London. They had both agreed to enter the race, but only as a team and only if a suitable sponsor could be found. In early 1934 Scott was called <b>to</b> <b>Stag</b> lane for a meeting with the business manager of the de Havilland Aircraft Company, where he was introduced to Arthur Edwards, an entrepreneur and speculative property developer. Edwards (Managing director of the Grosvenor House Hotel development) and Scott struck a deal within 20 minutes of meeting and it was in a private capacity that Edwards engaged the services of both Scott and Black, following his order directly off the drawing board of a de Havilland Comet. Scott's team was not the only team to have ordered a De Havilland DH.88 Comet to be designed and built specifically with the intention of being suitable to compete in, and win both the handicap and the speed section of the race. Jim Mollison and his wife Amy Mollison (Amy Johnson) ordered a Comet using their own funds and another team also gained sponsorship to purchase and race the third of the de Havilland Machines, which were to be designed, built and tested in time for the race. The Great Air Race would commence from Mildenhall aerodrome at 6.30 am on 20 October 1934.|$|E
