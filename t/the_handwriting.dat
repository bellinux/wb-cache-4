5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles {{was aware that}} <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> is typical for the 6th century, but <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, and {{could not have been}} written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view. According to Nicholas Pocock, {{the manuscript}} could not have been written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{hypothesized}} that the first hand might have been that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and {{is believed to have}} been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on details of <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> (see {{the section on}} handwriting below), they all agree that <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work {{in that part of the}} manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze <b>the</b> cursive <b>handwriting</b> of {{prospective}} primary school teachers from the perspective of legibility. The study is a descriptive one with its aim to portray the existing state of affairs, making use of qualitative methods. The research involves 130 prospective primary school teachers. They were asked to copy a text given by the researchers, using cursive <b>handwriting.</b> <b>The</b> cursive <b>handwriting</b> of prospective teachers was analyzed using <b>the</b> “Cursive <b>Handwriting</b> Assessment Form” provided by Erdoğan (2010). The study revealed that <b>the</b> cursive <b>handwriting</b> of prospective primary school teachers was adequately legible, yet not without problems regarding certain issues...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} made on the 6 th semester, {{in the field of}} history. In the report, the two authors seek to answer the {{following}} question: In what ways were cultural heritage and history used in the debate about the requested Danish delivery of <b>the</b> Icelandic <b>handwritings,</b> and how were the two types of arguments intertwined? The terms history and cultural heritage are used in the way that David Lowenthal describes them in the book Possessed by the past from 1996. The book Håndskriftsagens saga, written by Sigrún Davíðsdóttir and published in 1999, is used to describe the historical context in which the debate took place. To examine the side of the debate that argued against the handout of <b>the</b> Icelandic <b>handwritings,</b> we analyze <b>The</b> Danish <b>Handwriting</b> Commission’s work from 1951 : Betænkning vedrørende de i Danmark beroende islandske håndskrifter og museumsgenstande. To examine the side of the debate that argued for the handout of <b>the</b> Icelandic <b>handwritings,</b> we analyze Bjarni M. Gislason’s work from 1954 : De islandske håndskrifter – stadig aktuelle. Both parties use history for constructing a tale about <b>the</b> <b>handwritings</b> as a part of Icelandic cultural heritage (Gislason) and Danish/common Nordic cultural heritage (the commission), respectively. Culturally and historically based arguments are intertwined to argue the claim that <b>the</b> <b>handwritings</b> should be considered as cultural heritage in Iceland or Denmark/the north...|$|R

5|$|David C. Parker in 2004 {{argued that}} {{manuscript}} was written later the 6th century, {{because it has}} a small number of square letters, and <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> is not typical for the 6th century. Some letters were compressed (Μ, Δ, Ε), the bar over the letter Τ is short and the letter Υ is written in several ways. According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century.|$|E

From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how teachers and primary school pupils view <b>the</b> use of <b>handwriting</b> in literacy tuition and what their thoughts are on <b>the</b> future of <b>handwriting.</b> In <b>the</b> study, <b>handwriting</b> is compared to today’s digital ways of writing. The study sets out from the Swedish curriculum (Lgr 11) and is based on interviews with teachers and pupils in grades 1 – 3.

5|$|The fourth copy, {{owned by}} Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has {{remained}} in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken off-site for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes {{can be seen in}} the parchment from where it was once pinned up. <b>The</b> <b>handwriting</b> on this version is different from that of the other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe but rather by a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>handwriting</b> of {{the text}} from the {{beginning}} of Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, differs from that of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor more than in the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized <b>the</b> <b>handwriting.</b> This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E

White also had a richly inlaid table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small slip of paper on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between <b>the</b> <b>handwriting</b> of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White.

40|$|A generic {{system is}} {{proposed}} to automatically extract and clean handwritten items from business forms. Handwritten data usually touch or cross preprinted form frames and texts. Having {{assumed that the}} item-of-interest can be located roughly by existing form registration methods, we focus only on the extraction and cleaning of the filled-in items. The proposed system includes training and cleaning phases. In the training phase, a model template is generated automatically from a blank form. Features such as the position and stroke width of the preprinted entities (including form frames and instructions) are extracted. In the cleaning phase, the system registers the template to the input form by landmark alignment. The form frames are removed and <b>the</b> <b>handwritings</b> are restored by morphological operations. When <b>the</b> <b>handwritings</b> are found touching or crossing preprinted texts, morphological operations based on statistical features are used to clean them.
