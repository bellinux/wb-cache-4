40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{preliminary}} findings from an ongoing one year doctoral study of literacy programs provided at four alternative education settings in Queensland, Australia, and a comparative site in Texas. The research question being: "What are the literacy practices utilized for at risk adolescents across several alternative education sites?" In {{the developing world}} the concern is for delivering basic literacy education programs to large at risk segments of the population. In Australia, although these segments of <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>are</b> <b>smaller,</b> there nevertheless is some concern {{that in spite of}} nearly 200 years of mass education significant numbers of the population, approximately 10...|$|E

50|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that the}} key to {{reducing}} the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response, meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> <b>is</b> less expensive that managing <b>the</b> invasive <b>population</b> when it <b>is</b> widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.|$|R

The proof of this result is based on estimating transition times in Markov chains. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{much more}} {{advanced}} estimate for The Netherlands {{was made in}} 2001 by a collaboration of the National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM), Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM). The estimate arrived at around 50 percent of the production level, c.q. the national income of The Netherlands. This corresponds with the production level {{of the beginning of}} the 1970s. As <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>was</b> <b>smaller</b> at that time, the consumption per person was substantially higher than 50 percent of the present level.|$|R
50|$|The Entiat River {{supports}} {{populations of}} Chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and bull trout. <b>The</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> relatively <b>small</b> {{due to the}} scarcity of juvenile-rearing habitat in the lower Entiat River.|$|R
50|$|Sizeable populations {{exist in}} Spain (23,055 birds), Russia (8,000 birds), Turkey (800-3,000 birds), Portugal (1,435 birds) and Mongolia (1,000 birds). In Germany and Austria <b>the</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> <b>small</b> (Germany 2016: 232 birds; Austria 2012: 335 birds) but {{steadily}} growing {{for about two}} decades. Elsewhere, <b>the</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> declining due to habitat loss throughout its range. A sizeable population also exists in Hungary (1,100-1,300 birds) where the Eastern European steppe zone ends, near Dévaványa town {{and also in the}} Hortobágy National Park, Nagykunság and Nagy-Sárrét regions. <b>The</b> <b>population</b> <b>is</b> down from a population of 10,000-12,000 before the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{also has}} {{difficulty}} reproducing. It is clonal, often reproducing vegetatively, so <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> low in genetic variability. It may hybridize {{with the common}} Rhus glabra. This union forms Rhus × ashei, a natural hybrid. One major reproductive problem <b>is</b> that many <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> composed entirely of one sex. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> <b>small</b> and very widely spaced, making reproduction impossible. As the plant requires open habitat, it may arise in artificially cleared areas such as roadsides. There it is vulnerable to destruction from construction, maintenance, and herbicides.|$|R
