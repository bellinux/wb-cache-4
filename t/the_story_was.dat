5|$|As with Fleming's {{previous}} novels, Diamonds Are Forever received broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip.

5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> criticized for lacking a cohesive narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
