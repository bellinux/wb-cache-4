The components of magnetic refrigeration system are described. An analogy between magnetic refrigeration and conventional refrigeration is done concerning the steps and the original work received by the system.

This paper presents an LDAC system using electrodialysis (ED) as well as low grade heat generated from a hybrid photovoltaic thermal and evacuated tube (PVT-ET) collector for liquid desiccant regeneration. As ED regenerator is a key component in the proposed system, a modified mathematical model is used to simulate the mass transfer of the ED stack. The performance of the model was validated using the experimental data generated based on a lab-scale experimental setup. It is shown that the model predicted concentration of the solution in the regenerated tank matched well with the experimental data. Compared to the LDAC systems using conventional thermal regeneration, the proposed ED system can regenerate the LiCl liquid desiccant solution at a low temperature.

To this hope, a practical 2 D model for predicting the refrigeration capacity and the efficiency of an AMR cycle in the room temperature range has been developed. The core of a magnetic refrigerator system is the Active Magnetic Regenerator (AMR). It is a special kind of <b>thermal</b> <b>regenerator,</b> made of magnetic material which works both as a refrigerating medium and such as a heat regenerating medium. The performance of an AMR system strongly depends on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of the magnetic material used to build the regenerator.

In modern steel industry, packed bed regenerator is widely utilized in the reheating furnace to increase the furnace efficiency. This study established a two dimensional numerical model to simulate a packed bed used in regenerative furnaces. The physical properties of fluids and packed stuffing (such as density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat) are considered as functions of temperature to adapt the large temperature variation in operation. The transient temperature profiles of the flue gas, packed bed, and air during the heating and regeneration period are examined for various switching time (30, 60, 120, and 240 s). The results reveal that, during the heating period, the spanwise averaged heat transfer coefficient is decreased along the longitudinal downstream direction, while during the regeneration period, the opposite trend is true.

40|$|Cyclic thermal regenerators have an {{important}} industrial application, however most of the design techniques are old and use many simplifying assumptions. With the advent of digital computers many of these simplifying assumptions can be examined, however {{there is very little}} scope for practical verification. An apparatus has been designed, built and fully commissioned to investigate <b>thermal</b> <b>regenerator</b> characteristics. The analog operation of the apparatus is enhanced by four computer aspects. Commissioning of the regenerator highlighted how the response of apparatus can be influenced by the peripheral pipework around the test section, radiation effects from the heaters and jetting of air into the regenerator packed bed section. A series of experiments, comprising runs (a maximum of ten period changes) within a set-up (a known air flowrate and packed bed length) were formulated to examine the regenerator response, using three types of spherical packing, steel lead glass and alumina. A method of obtaining convective heat transfer coefficients was produced and represented in two forms. One in a graphical form which can be used for cyclic regenerator designs without the prior knowledge of a heat transfer coefficient, whilst the other form is data stored on a computer disc which produces convective heat transfer coefficients for regenerator raw data. Analysis of the practical data clearly shows the importance of the number of cycles required to reach equilibrium, test bed heat leak and packing intraconduction. Finally, prior to each cyclic set-up a single shot run was performed and the convective heat transfer coefficient obtained using Darabi's(1981) graphical technique. This offered a unique opportunity to compare cylic and single shot characteristics for the same physical system...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} refrigeration {{is a new}} highly efficient and environmentally protective technology, which could be an actual solution for the typical problems of the vapour compression systems. The core of a magnetic refrigerator system is the Active Magnetic Regenerator (AMR). It is {{a special kind of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>regenerator</b> made of magnetic material which works both as a refrigerating medium and as a heat regenerating medium. The performance of an AMR system strongly depends on the magnetocaloric effect of the magnetic material used to build the regenerator. In the present paper, a model to simulate the thermal behaviour of an AMR has been introduced for predicting the performance of an AMR refrigerator system. Different magnetic materials have been considered as refrigerant: pure gadolinium, second order phase magnetic transition binary rare earth alloys (SOMT) and first order phase magnetic transition alloys (FOMT). The SOMT are GdxDy 1 !x and GdxTb 1 !x whereas the FOMT are Gd 5 (SixGe 1 !x) 4 and MnAs 1 !xSbx. The magnetocaloric behaviour of gadolinium can be correctly predicted by the Weiss molecular field theory. This approach can be generalized for binary alloys with a second order phase transition. The behaviour of the MnAs 1 !xSbx alloys is described by means of a model based on the phenomenological approach of Bean Rodbell. Interpolation of empirical data is utilized for the evaluation of the magnetocaloric effect of Gd 5 (SixGe 1 !x) 4 alloys. With this model, the refrigeration capacity, the power consumption and consequently the Coefficient of Performance of the cycle can be predicted. The results of the simulation clearly show that Gd 5 (SixGe 1 !x) 4 is the best magnetic material with a COP that is always greater then that of a traditional vapour compression plant in the same operating conditions (from a minimum of + 40...|$|E
40|$|A novel cyclic {{reactor system}} is {{proposed}} for heterogeneous, catalytic, gas-phase reactions. This system utilises the inherent {{characteristics of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>regenerator</b> to impose favourable reaction temperature profiles along the catalyst bed without setting up radial temperature gradients. This control of the longitudinal profile enables higher conversions to be obtained than those from steady state reactors. The reactor system is investigated by computer simulation using the endothermic, reversible dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene {{in the presence of}} steam as an example. The higher conversions obtained from the proposed system produce utility cost savings in this process. Kinetics presented in the literature for this reaction are compared and assessed. None of these is entirely satisfactory and a more representative set is derived. Models for the reacting and regenerating bed are discussed and suitable models are presented. A comparative study of solution methods for these models is carried out in order to determine one which gives an accurate solution and also minimises computing requirements. The most suitable operating policy lor the system, with an endothermic reaction, is the use of constant heat inputs with constant flow during each period of operation, This allows the bed inlet temperature to vary with time, but {{it seems likely that the}} damping effect of the system will be large and the inlet temperatures may be assumed constant Counter-current, rather than co-current, operation of the system is preferred, A simple design procedure, which does not require the solution of the cyclic model, is described. This is found to give good predictions of the cyclic steady state performance of the system. Che effect of the various system parameters on the performance is investigated. The major parameters for a given bed size are the period time, reactor and regenerator steam flows and regenerator inlet temperature. It is shown that the system can give higher conversions than a steady state reactor but i. t may be desirable to operate at lower conversions to reduce the operating cost.

It uses an innovative 3 He cryogenic circulator to provide continuous remote/distributed cooling at temperatures {{in the range of}} 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K. A critical component technology for this cooling system is a highly efficient active magnetic regenerator, which is a regenerative heat exchanger with its matrix material made of magnetic refrigerant gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG). Creare Inc. is developing a microchannel GGG regenerator with an anisotropic structured bed for high system <b>thermal</b> efficiency. The <b>regenerator</b> core consists of a stack of thin, single-crystal GGG disks alternating with thin polymer insulating layers. The insulating layers help minimize the axial conduction heat leak, since GGG has a very high thermal conductivity in the regenerator s operating temperature range. The GGG disks contain micro channels with width near 100 micrometers, which enhance the heat transfer between the circulating flow and the refrigerant bed. The unique flow configuration of the GGG plates ensures a uniform flow distribution across the plates. The main fabrication challenges for the regenerator are the machining of high-aspect-ratio microchannels in fragile, single-crystal GGG disks and fabrication and assembly of the GGG insulation layers. Feasibility demonstrations to date include use of an ultrashort- pulse laser to machine microchannels without producing unacceptable microcracking or deposition of recast material, as shown in the figure, and attachment of a thin insulation layer to a GGG disk without obstructing the flow paths.

30|$|In {{the last}} 20  years, {{the use of}} organic Rankine cycle instead of a simple Rankine cycle has been {{considered}} The operating ORC power plants around the world, with capacities ranging from 200  kW to 130  MW, demonstrate special attention to this technology. This cycle uses heat sources with low temperatures (100 – 500  °C). The ORC cycle works based on the simple Rankine cycle; however, to work with organic fluids, some changes must be applied. Organic working fluid in the ORC could be selected from the hydrocarbons; however, inorganic materials such as silicon and refrigeration fluids can also be used. ORC technology is significantly used in waste heat recycling of waste heat from gas turbines and it has significant advantages compared to classical heat regenerator system using a conventional Rankine cycle [12, 19]. A great deal of {{research has been done}} in the field of organic Rankine cycle. Yamamato et al. [23] examined an organic Rankine cycle using HCFC- 123 as a working fluid and concluded that this system has a better performance compared to using water as the working fluid [23]. Liu et al. [10] studied the effects of different working fluid on <b>thermal</b> and heat <b>regenerator</b> efficiencies. It showed that the wet fluid is inappropriate for ORC systems [10]. Wei et al. [22] studied the analysis and optimization of organic Rankine cycle using (1, 1, 1, 3, 3 penta-fluoro-propane) HFC-FA 245 as the working fluid. The results showed that the use of the output heat is a good solution to improve the system efficiency and net output power. The condenser outlet cooling degree should be small (0.5 – 0.6  K). When the ambient temperature is high, system output power and efficiency was reduced about 30 % from the nominal value. [22]. Saleh et al. [16] examined 31 fluids for the organic Rankine cycle operations in extremely low temperature and pressure, based on backbone relationship. Fluids include: alkanes, fluorinated alkanes, fluorinated ethers, and esters. Cycles operated between 30 and 100  °C in geothermal power plants under pressures limited to 20 Bar; however, in some cases, the supercritical pressures are considered. The thermal efficiency of operating fluids R 125 and C 5 F 12, is 2.3 and 10.5 %, respectively [16]. Tchanche et al. [18] analyzed the thermodynamic characteristics and functions of 20 fluids in the solar ORCs, in low temperature, and suggested R 134 a as the best fluid [18].|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot plant}} is {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} Regenerative Cyclic Reactor (RCR) system. The proposed RCR system utilizes the inherent characteristics of the <b>thermal</b> <b>regenerator</b> to provide control over the temperature profiles along the reactor {{in order to enhance}} the reactant conversion. The RCR system is a transient adiabatic reactor which avoids the radial temperature gradients set up in tubular reactors. The reaction being investigated, the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, uses steam as a diluent. The steam is also used as the temperature regeneration medium. The pilot plant design accommodates a steady state adiabatic reactor (SSAR) arrangement (one and two stage processes) as well as a one bed RCR system. Thus it is possible to compare the transient and steady state reactors. With only electrical heating available, radiative electrical firebar heaters are used to generate the high system temperatures. Mathematical models are used to aid the heater design and to predict the temperatures for steady state operation. Other models are used to help in assessing the power load step up and step down rates. The small flowrates, long pipe lengths, and the high temperature levels pose considerable problems in heat loss compensation over the system. Models are developed to assess the transfer resistances limiting the operational temperatures on ceramic bead insulated resistance wires. Heat shields utilizing these wires and a copper plate covering are successfully commissioned. Mathematical descriptions of these shields are also developed. A combination of these shields and heat tracing tapes enables reactor temperatures within the industrial operation range to be attained. A series of transient runs of varying duration for the RCR, as well as steady state runs are carried out. Comparisons show that much higher conversions are obtained for the RCR than the SSAR. A significant increase in conversion and the time taken to achieve steady state conversion occurs as the catalyst is regenerated by the steam. Steady state conversions for the early runs show some agreement with model predictions based on steady state kinetics. The transient runs and the later steady state runs show conversions much higher than those predicted by mathematical models...|$|E
