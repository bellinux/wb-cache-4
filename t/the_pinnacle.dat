5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of his medium, now called wood engraving.

5|$|Two weeks later, on {{the night}} 19/20 April 1943, the {{battalion}} {{took part in the}} 5th Infantry Brigade's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna. The village was situated atop a steep slope, and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines, which wounded a number of men, including the commanding officer. Nevertheless, two sections under the command of Sergeant Haane te Rauawa Manahi, managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> in the early dawn. Following heavy shellfire and hand-to-hand combat with the Italian defenders, the Māoris were forced off <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> twice; each time, though, Manahi led his small force in a counterattack. In the afternoon, Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions, encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender. For these actions, Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross, but the nomination was not approved and he received a Distinguished Conduct Medal instead.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia {{began her}} {{military}} {{career in the}} spring of 270, during the reign of Claudius Gothicus. Under the pretext of attacking the Tanukhids, she conquered Roman Arabia. This was followed in October by an invasion of Egypt, ending with a Palmyrene victory and Zenobia's proclamation as queen of Egypt. Palmyra invaded Anatolia the following year, reaching Ankara and <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of its expansion.|$|E

50|$|Schuyler Hain was a homesteader {{who arrived}} in <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> area in 1891 from Michigan, {{following}} his parents and eight siblings to Bear Valley. His cousin, A.W. White, {{was a student at}} Stanford University, and White brought one of his professors to see <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> in 1893. Dr. Gilbert was impressed by the scenery, and his comments inspired Hain to publicize the region. Hain led tours to Bear Valley and through the caves, advocating the preservation of <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles.</b> Hain's efforts resulted in a 1904 visit by Stanford president David Starr Jordan, who contacted Fresno Congressman James C. Needham. Jordan and Needham in turn influenced Gifford Pinchot to advocate the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> Forest Reserve to President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt proclaimed the establishment on July 8, 1906. Pinchot, who was primarily interested in the management of forests for productive use rather than for preservation, advocated the use of the recently passed Antiquities Act to designate the scenic core of <b>the</b> area as <b>Pinnacles</b> National Monument, which was done by Roosevelt on January 16, 1908. This designation nominally passed control of <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> from <b>the</b> Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, but the U.S. Forest Service retained effective control of the area until circa 1911.|$|R

The hive, now abandoned, has been sent to local bee keepers to identify.|$|R
5|$|Ag2r had {{a meager}} 2011 season, {{managing}} only six victories. <b>The</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of the team's season {{was certainly the}} Giro d'Italia. John Gadret, one of the team's leaders, won the undulating 11th stage to Castelfidardo. Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history. Hubert Dupont also rode very strongly in this race, to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well.|$|E
5|$|Astana raced a light {{schedule}} in the fall, with <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of their season having {{come at the}} Tour de France.

Their best results from this crop of races came from Alexander Vinokourov, who finished seventh in Lombardy and fifth in the Giro dell'Emilia.|$|E

50|$|Europeans {{first visited}} {{the area in}} 1658 when Dutch maps {{recorded}} North and South Hummocks on their maps. Phillip Parker King also mentioned the Hummocks in his journals in 1820. <b>The</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> Desert area remained relatively unknown until surveyed in 1934. The national park was created in July 1994 by combining three separate reserve areas gazetted in 1956, 1967 (<b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles)</b> and 1968.|$|R
50|$|The raw {{material}} for the limestone of <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> came from seashells in an earlier era that was rich in marine life. These shells were broken down into lime-rich sands that were blown inland to form high mobile dunes.However, {{the manner in which}} such {{raw material}}s formed <b>the</b> <b>Pinnacles</b> is <b>the</b> subject of debate and three theories have been proposed.|$|R
5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs {{was so great that}} the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|The American sailors {{participated in}} Fleet {{sporting}} events, as well, giving excellent account of themselves.

An engineman from Florida won the lightweight title, a chief carpenter's mate from New York won the middleweight title, and a fireman from the same ship reached the heavyweight finals.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> {{members of society}} (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E

5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle.</b> In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

5|$|Egypt reached <b>the</b> <b>pinnacle</b> of {{its power}} in the New Kingdom, during the Ramesside period, where it rivalled the Hittite Empire, Assyrian Empire and Mitanni Empire, after which it entered a period of slow decline. Egypt was invaded or conquered by a {{succession}} of foreign powers, such as the Canaanites/Hyksos, Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, Babylonians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians in the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Period of Egypt. In the aftermath of Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the new ruler of Egypt. This Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom ruled Egypt until 30BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province.|$|E
