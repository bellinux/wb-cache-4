Several factors such as nitrate concentration, pH, chelating ligand affect the efficiency of this method in the determination of iron (Fe) in waters. In this study, the effect of nitrate in phytoplankton culture medium on the determination of Fe concentration by LSC method using 55 Fe <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> was evaluated. The measured Fe concentrations in the medium were lower than its added concentration (1. 5 μM) when liquid samples contain nitrate. Fe concentrations decreased exponentially as nitrate concentrations increased up to 2. 64 mM, reaching a constant value of 1. 31 μM Fe at nitrate concentrations higher than 2. 64 mM. A correction factor (f = 1. 14) was calculated from the decrease rate of Fe concentrations at different nitrate concentrations in the phytoplankton culture medium. This correction factor can be used to correct the measurement values of Fe concentrations in phytoplankton culture medium obtained from LSC method. Our results showed that up to 94 % of the added Fe can be determined by LSC using 55 Fe <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer.</b> The remaining 6 % was probably bound to the walls of the culturing vessel.

40|$|AbstractUnidirectional fluxes from ATP to phosphocreatine, catalyzed by the MM {{isoenzyme}} of creatine kinase, {{were measured}} {{by both the}} 31 P-NMR saturation transfer technique and <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> ([γ- 32 P]ATP) method. It was found that at 30 – 37 °C and pH 7. 4, {{over a wide range}} of[phosphocreatine]/[creatine] (from 0. 2 to 5. 0) ratios, both methods gave the same results, showing that magnetization transfer allows determination of real fluxes under ‘physiological’ conditions. However, at[PCr]/[Cr] ratios higher than 5 ([ADP]free < 30 μM) or at lower temperatures (t < 15 °C,[PCr]/[Cr] ∼ 1), the fluxes assessed by saturation transfer were somewhat faster than those detected by the <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> method. These data imply that under physiological conditions phosphoryl group transfer is actually the rate-determining step of the creatine kinase reaction.

The magnetic technique does not use radiation and provides both a color change (brown dye) and a handheld probe for node localization. The primary end point of this trial {{was defined as the}} proportion of sentinel nodes detected with each technique (identification rate). Methods A total of 160 women with breast cancer scheduled for SLNB, who were clinically and radiologically node negative, were recruited from seven centers in the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. SLNB was undertaken after administration of both the magnetic and standard <b>tracers</b> (<b>radioisotope</b> with or without blue dye). Results A total of 170 SLNB procedures were undertaken on 161 patients, and 1 patient was excluded, leaving 160 patients for further analysis. The identification rate was 95. 0 % (152 of 160) with the standard technique and 94. 4 % (151 of 160) with the magnetic technique (0. 6 % difference; 95 % upper confidence limit 4. 4 %; 6. 9 % discordance). Of the 22 % (35 of 160) of patients with lymph node involvement, 16 % (25 of 160) had at least 1 macrometastasis, and 6 % (10 of 160) had at least a micrometastasis. Another 2. 5 % (4 of 160) had isolated tumor cells. Of 404 lymph nodes removed, 297 (74 %) were true sentinel nodes.

The hospital at that time had Marconi deep therapy X-Ray machines installed, with which Farmer was closely familiar from his time working at Marconi, {{and as a result}} the hospital was able to keep these machines in clinical use for many years. Farmer's team brough together experts in health physics, radio-isotopes, ultrasonics, instrumentation and physiological measurement. Specific innovations included the world's first gantry-mounted linear particle accelerator for cancer treatment, installed in 1963, and numerous clinical uses of the <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> technique, developed using radio-isotopes from the nuclear reactors at Amersham and Harwell, which became available to researchers after World War II. When the new department opened, Farmer was appointed first Professor of Medical Physics at Newcastle University in 1966. While at the RVI, Farmer and his team turned the facility into a renowned centre for research into medical applications of radio-isotope technology, providing services in these areas to the entire region of Northern England, which had previously had none. At the time of Frank Farmer's retirement in 1978, the department had branches in Teesside and Cumbria, as well as the three hospitals in Newcastle, and employed 70 scientific and technical staff.|$|R

To quantify and predict fungal nitrogen redistribution, and assess the importance of the integrity of fungal networks in soil for ecosystem function, we need better understanding of the structures and processes involved. Until recently nitrogen translocation has been experimentally intractable owing to the lack of a suitable <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> for nitrogen, and the impossibility of observing nitrogen translocation in real time under realistic conditions. We have developed an imaging method for recording the magnitude and direction of amino acid flow through the whole mycelial network as it captures, assimilates and channels its carbon and nitrogen resources, while growing in realistically heterogeneous soil microcosms. Computer analysis and modeling, based on these digitized video records, can reveal patterns in transport that suggest experimentally testable hypotheses. Experimental approaches that we are developing include genomics and stable isotope NMR to investigate where in the system nitrogen compounds are being acquired and stored, and where they are mobilized for transport or broken down. The results are elucidating the interplay between environment, metabolism, and the development and function of transport networks as mycelium forages in soil. The highly adapted and selected foraging networks of fungi may illuminate fundamental principles applicable to other supply networks. © Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{live animal}} gamma <b>radioisotope</b> <b>tracer</b> {{techniques}} {{in the field}} of ecotoxicology allows laboratory studies to accurately monitor contaminant biokinetics in real time for an individual organism. However, methods used in published studies for aquatic organisms are rarely described in sufficient detail to allow for study replication or an assessment of the errors associated with live animal radioanalysis to be identified. We evaluate the influence of some important methodological deficiencies through an overview of the literature on live aquatic animal radiotracer techniques and through the results obtained from our radiotracer studies on four aquatic invertebrate species. The main factors discussed are animal rinsing, radioanalysis and geometry corrections. We provide examples of three main techniques in live aquatic animal radiotracer studies to improve data quality control and demonstrate why each technique is crucial in interpreting the data from such studies. The animal rinsing technique is also relevant to non-radioisotope tracer studies, especially those involving nanoparticles. We present clear guidance on how to perform each technique and explain the importance of proper reporting of the validation of each technique for individual studies. In this paper we describe methods that are often used in lab-based radioecology studies but are rarely described in great detail. We hope that this paper will act as the basis for standard operating procedures for future radioecology studies to improve study replication and data quality control...|$|R
