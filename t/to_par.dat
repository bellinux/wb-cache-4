5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up <b>to</b> <b>par</b> production-wise.|$|E
5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and {{expected it to be}} of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game to be the best among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation <b>to</b> <b>par</b> with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 <b>to</b> <b>par,</b> for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from subpar <b>to</b> <b>par.</b> Reviewers praised Kameo graphics as setting {{standards for the}} new console, and noted its vivid color palette. Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overbearing tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core morphing concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up <b>to</b> <b>par.</b> In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to create a more technologically advanced game. As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.|$|E
5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is not up <b>to</b> <b>par.</b>|$|E

5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up <b>to</b> <b>par</b> with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E
5|$|The local {{government}} bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance {{was started in}} 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction. With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994, the state implemented reforms in local self-governance. The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of {{local government}} with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed <b>to</b> <b>par</b> with the Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government.|$|E

According to literature data and due to bad long-term hearing results the authors advise against surgical approach to middle ear tympanosclerosis...|$|R

50|$|The {{main input}} <b>to</b> the <b>pars</b> reticulata {{derives from the}} striatum. It comes by two routes, known as the direct and {{indirect}} pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly <b>to</b> <b>pars</b> reticulata. The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the globus pallidus; a GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, and a glutamatergic projection from the subthalamic nucleus <b>to</b> the <b>pars</b> reticulata. Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the pars reticulata but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: They are tightly intermingled, but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.|$|R

The Hawkeyes also made several mental errors by fumbling the ball twice while Brad Banks threw a rare interception. The game could have been much closer had Steen not intercepted all three passes deep in Iowa territory. The three interceptions is also an Iowa single-game record.|$|E
