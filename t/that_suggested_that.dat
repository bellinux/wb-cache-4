Approximately eleven transits, full and partial, were observed. Use of the EulerCAM photometer at the La Silla Observatory's 1.2 m Leonhard Euler Telescope on March 29, 2008 provided further evidence for an exoplanet by better defining the transit's curve. Later, the CORALIE spectrograph (also on the Euler telescope) between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 used Doppler spectroscopy to collect 21 radial velocity measurements. Analysis confirmed {{the presence of a}} planet that was later designated WASP-15b.|$|E

25|$|Calculations by {{physicist}} Allen Everett {{show that}} warp bubbles {{could be used}} to create closed timelike curves in general relativity, meaning that the theory predicts that they could be used for backwards time travel. While {{it is possible that the}} fundamental laws of physics might allow closed timelike curves, the chronology protection conjecture hypothesizes that in all cases where the classical theory of general relativity allows them, quantum effects would intervene to eliminate the possibility, making these spacetimes impossible to realize (a possible type of effect that would accomplish this is a buildup of vacuum fluctuations on the border of the region of spacetime where time travel would first become possible, causing the energy density to become high enough to destroy the system that would otherwise become a time machine). Some results in semiclassical gravity appear to support the conjecture, including a calculation dealing specifically with quantum effects in warp-drive spacetimes <b>that</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> warp bubbles would be semiclassically unstable, but ultimately the conjecture can only be decided by a full theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{on a series of}} emails in early 2007 between HUD assistant secretaries Kim Kendrick and Orlando J.

On the date these e-mails were sent, HUD notified the housing authority that it had been found in violation of rules requiring that 5 percent of housing be accessible to disabled residents. The department later argued that because the authority refused to acknowledge it was in violation and to agree to a specific remedy, it was in violation of a broader agreement that put $50 million in federal funding in jeopardy. Greene, who later was forced to resign from the Philadelphia Housing Authority due to numerous accusations of wrongdoings, asserted that the HUD actions were in retaliation against PHA because Greene had refused to turn over property to Universal Community Homes, a development company founded by Kenny Gamble; Greene said that Universal had not performed as promised. Gamble complained to Jackson about the situation in 2006.|$|E

His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E
