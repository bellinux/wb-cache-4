5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> the summer of 1959, costing £14,500, {{a substantial part of}} which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs {{in the summer and}} autumn.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} {{from the}} NKMNP were caught above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> vegetation, {{suggesting that the}} species is arboreal like {{the other members of}} its genus. The chigger Eutrombicula batatas has been found on O.sydandersoni. Nothing else is known about ecology, behavior, diet, reproduction, or conservation status.|$|E

5|$|Although mainly terrestrial, these snakes {{are good}} {{swimmers}} {{and can also}} climb with ease; often they are found basking in low bushes. One specimen was found 4.6 m above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> a densely branched tree.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta grows solitary or {{scattered}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> mixed oak, hickory and chestnut forests from southern New England to Texas. The species has {{a preference for}} sandy or loose soils. Its range extends north to Nova Scotia, Canada, and south to Mexico.|$|E

50|$|In 1903 the {{trustees}} rented The Sportsfield to a committee consisting of all GAA members. The Kerry County Board then purchased <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> 1929. In 1934 The Sportsfield was {{converted into a}} rectangular pitch to host the 1934 All Ireland Semi Final {{which led to the}} demise of the famous cider track. In 1944 the County Board renamed <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>in</b> honour of Austin Stack.|$|R

5|$|The He 111Z's {{operational}} {{history was}} minimal. One machine {{was caught by}} RAF fighter aircraft over France on 14 March 1944. The He 111Z was towing a Gotha Go 242, and was shot down. Eight were shot down or destroyed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> 1944.|$|E
5|$|The family Stercorariidae are, in general, {{medium to}} large birds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.|$|E

5|$|The golden swallow is {{victim to}} various {{mammalian}} nest predators, including the introduced Indian mongoose, feral cats, and multiple species of rats. These predators {{are thought to}} be linked to the extinction of the nominate subspecies. Nests on or near <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> mines are especially vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds were placed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> front of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|All races must {{be started}} by {{the report of the}} starter's gun or {{approved}} starting apparatus fired upwards after they have ascertained that athletes are steady and in the correct starting position.

5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{clock was}} moved from Highbury {{to the outer}} side of the new stadium, with a new larger version of the feature added inside <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> August 2010.

5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> the night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened {{to do the same}} to Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended the first day of fighting.|$|E
