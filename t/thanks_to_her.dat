5|$|In 1946 {{while at}} Boston University, Massaquoi {{completed}} editing the autobiography (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: The Autobiography of a Vai Noblewoman). <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> extensive travels and education, by this time, she spoke several languages—at least eight and four tribal dialects. In {{addition to her}} native Vai and Mende, she spoke English which she had first learnt at school in Liberia, German from her many years in Hamburg, and French from her schooling in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Massaquoi arrived {{that same}} year in the United States and {{experienced}} the racial segregation and Jim Crow laws of the Southern States. She first attended Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, graduating in sociology. Two years later she moved to Fisk University in Nashville earning two master's degrees, first in sociology and then in anthropology in 1944. She assisted her professor, Mark Hanna Watkins, in {{his understanding of the}} Vai language, cooperating with him in compiling a Vai dictionary. She agreed to accept a fellowship as a linguistic advisor, after her father died in 1938. She taught French and German at Fisk and also paid her way by giving instruction in African and European folk dancing, as well as teaching the violin, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own competence on the instrument.|$|E

60|$|Victoria {{scarcely}} heard Austen's acknowledgments of her kindness, so perfunctory {{did they}} seem, so unlike {{the man she}} had known; and her own protestations that she had done nothing <b>to</b> merit his <b>thanks</b> were <b>to</b> <b>her</b> quite as unreal. She {{introduced him to the}} Englishman.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Dustbin Baby {{was one of}} four {{works of}} children's {{television}} shortlisted for the International Emmy Award in the children and young people category at the 37th International Emmy Awards. The other nominations were Lharn Poo Koo E-Joo (produced by Workpoint Entertainment), The Little Emperor's Christmas (produced by Rede Globo), and Mille (produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation). The film was one of nine nominations for the UK, which had more than any other nation. The film won the award, making it one of six International Emmys for the UK, and one of three for the BBC, in 2009. Dustbin Baby was also shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Awards in the drama category, along with The Sarah Jane Adventures (also by the BBC), S4C's Rhestr Nadolig Wil, and the online show following boyband US5. The ceremony was held on 29 November at The London Hilton on Park Lane and hosted by Dick and Dom. Dustbin Baby lost out to Rhestr Nadolig Wil.

5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E
25|$|Fossey is {{responsible}} for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into pyrethrum farms. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> efforts, the park boundary was lowered from the 3,000-meter line to the 2,500-meter line.|$|E
50|$|In July, at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Karmakar won {{a bronze}} medal in the women's vault final, <b>thanks</b> largely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> Produnova vault, which has a {{difficulty}} value of 7.00. She received an average two-vault score of 14.366. She was the first Indian woman to win a Commonwealth Games gymnastics medal, and the second Indian overall, after Ashish Kumar.|$|R
5000|$|Silverman's {{interest}} in anthropology began {{at an early}} age, <b>thanks</b> in part <b>to</b> <b>her</b> uncle Hirshel Bassman. With her uncle, Silverman explored ideas such as mysticism and [...] "oriental religions." ...|$|R
50|$|A dentist, Dr. Cynthia Sheldrake, hires Bernice <b>to</b> {{break into}} <b>her</b> ex-husband Christopher's home and steal back her jewelry.

25|$|Halfway {{through the}} series, Kilala {{experiences}} a hair style change <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother. Her hair is thinner and longer, contrasting to her thick hair before. Kilala's three curls are looser, and the braid {{at the back}} is replaced with red beads.|$|E
25|$|Hürrem became Süleyman's partner {{not only}} in the Sultan's household, but also in state affairs. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> intelligence, she acted as Süleyman's chief adviser on matters of state, and seems to have had an {{influence}} upon foreign policy and international politics. She frequently accompanied him as a political adviser. Hürrem's influence on Süleyman was so significant that rumors circulated around the Ottoman court that the sultan had been bewitched.|$|E
25|$|Meena Kumari {{has always}} been a subject of {{interest}} anong present day filmmakers, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> massive star appeal. In 2005, a modern day adaption of her classic film Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam was to be made in which Priyanka Chopra was to portray her role of 'Chhoti Bahu'. However, the film got shelved and paved way for a TV series helmed by director Rituparno Ghosh in which actress Raveena Tandon essayed this role.|$|E
50|$|Her father first {{guided her}} into the {{direction}} of natural science even though, already as a teenager, she took pleasure in humanistic subjects like Literature and History of Art and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> one of <b>her</b> teachers, Sister Ignazia, she grew very fond of History.|$|R

50|$|Cheng {{was born}} in Hampshire, England but moved to Sussex when she was one, and {{spent the rest of}} her {{childhood}} there. Her interest in mathematics stemmed from a young age <b>thanks</b> largely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother who made mathematics a part of life. Her father was also supportive, encouraging <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be imaginative; but Cheng's biggest influence was her mother, who introduced stimulating mathematical ideas and used the language of logic naturally.|$|R
25|$|In 1974 the East German {{authorities}} {{announced that}} they wanted to bring the museum and its exhibits under state control. In protest von Mahlsdorf began giving away the exhibits to visitors. Thanks to the committed involvement of the actress Annekathrin Bürger and the attorney Friedrich Karl Kaul (and possibly also <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> enlistment as an inoffizieller Mitarbeiter or Stasi collaborator) the authorities' attempt was stopped in 1976 and she was able to keep the museum.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} artist, {{she sang}} all palos to perfection, excelling especially in siguiriyas {{of which she}} preserved several styles like those of Ciego de la Peña and El Marruro, which have reached our days <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She was a direct transmitter of the soléa of La Serneta, which she learnt directly from her author, but also left memorable recordings of many other soleá styles like those of Enrique el Mellizo, Frijones or many other styles from Alcalá, Triana or Jerez.|$|E
25|$|Patty Loveless (born Patricia Lee Ramey; January 4, 1957) is an American {{country music}} singer. Since her {{emergence}} {{on the country}} music scene in late 1986 with her first (self-titled) album, Loveless {{has been one of}} the most popular female singers of neotraditional country. She has also recorded albums in the country pop and bluegrass genres. Loveless was born in Pikeville, Kentucky, and raised in Elkhorn City, Kentucky, and Louisville, Kentucky. She rose to stardom <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> blend of honky tonk and country-rock and a plaintive, emotional ballad style.|$|E
50|$|As Ms. Marvel, Sharon had superhuman {{strength}} and endurance, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> augmentation of <b>her</b> physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus {{on behalf of}} the Power Broker.

5000|$|Wendy Sulca Quispe (born April 22, 1996 in San Juan de Miraflores, Perú) is a Peruvian {{singer of}} Huayno music, who found fame <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> YouTube, where <b>her</b> videos [...] "La Tetita" [...] ("The tittie"), [...] "Cerveza, Cerveza" [...] ("Beer, beer") and [...] "Papito" [...] ("Daddy") {{exceeded}} ten million hits.|$|R
60|$|At which {{everybody}} laughed, which was her sole intention; but Cecil, who had said so much less, really thought what Rosamond said in mere play. Those extorted <b>thanks</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> a victory of her sex {{in a field}} she had never thought of; and though she {{had no desire to}} emulate the lady, and felt that a daughter of Dunstone must remember noblesse oblige, the focus of her enthusiasm was in an odd state of shifting.|$|R
25|$|<b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend Barbara Bennett (sister of Constance and Joan), Brooks almost {{immediately}} found employment as a chorus girl in George White's Scandals, {{followed by an}} appearance as a featured dancer in the 1925 edition of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway. As {{a result of her}} work in the Follies, she {{came to the attention of}} Paramount Pictures producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a five-year contract with the studio in 1925. (She was also noticed by visiting movie star Charlie Chaplin, who was in town for the premiere of his film The Gold Rush. The two had a two-month affair that summer).|$|E
25|$|At midday on 3 October 1836 the {{foundation}} stone was laid by Ann Thwaytes. At 11 am gentlemen inhabitants, subscribers and visitors joined a procession at the St George's Baths and walked {{with the local}} charity school children (beneficiaries of Mrs Thwaytes) to the site to present her with a silver trowel. The ceremony was watched by invited ladies seated on a dais in a plantation decorated with flags, and enlivened by a military band. At 2 pm the charity children and their parents, totalling 500, received a free dinner provided by Mrs Thwaytes. In the afternoon there were boat races, a punt chase and a tightrope performance. On the Pier during the evening there was a Grand Illumination, a firework display, another tightrope performance, magic feats by Ching Lau Lauro, {{a model of the}} Clock Tower in fireworks, the Pier entrance illuminated by 30,000 variegated lamps, and a released balloon carrying Mrs Thwaytes' name in fire. An address of <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> was read by George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees who had been appointed by Mrs Thwaytes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Sutherland's voice started to decline and her vibrato {{loosened}} to an intrusive extent. However, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> vocal agility and solid technique, she continued singing {{the most difficult}} roles amazingly well. As her vocal security to some extent lessened, paradoxically her dramatic grasp of the theatrical moment heightened. During the 1980s, she added Anna Bolena, Amalia in I masnadieri, and Adriana Lecouvreur to her repertoire, and repeated Esclarmonde at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length dramatic performance was as Marguerite de Valois (Les Huguenots) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, {{at the age of}} 63, where she sang Home Sweet Home for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of Die Fledermaus on New Year's Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to her own words, given in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in Esclarmonde. She considered those performances and recordings her best.|$|E
50|$|The National Art School did {{not offer}} a course in {{photography}} at this time, but Hall became a competent photographer <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> mentoring from <b>her</b> painting teacher at ESTS.

He said that Tymoshenko had already practically usurped power <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> size of <b>her</b> parliamentary majority, with her party allies Oleksandr Turchynov and Arseniy Yatsenyuk headed the government.|$|R
50|$|It was {{established}} {{that she was}} born shortly before 7 April 1249 from the second marriage of the Kuyavian Duke with Constance, daughter of Henry II the Pious, Duke of Wrocław. After 1278 she entered in the Dominican Convent in Sandomierz, located in the lands of her brother Leszek II the Black. The title of foundress placed in her tombstone was probably <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> either <b>her</b> prestige of through the intercession of her brother Leszek II. She died on 8 December 1291 and the year of 1211 on the tombstone was explained as carelessness of the sculptor.|$|R
25|$|Scherzinger {{was born}} in Maui and raised in Honolulu, into a Catholic family. Her father, Alfonso Valiente, is of Filipino descent, while her mother, Rosemary Elikolani, has Native Hawaiian and Ukrainian ancestry. Scherzinger's parents {{separated}} {{when she was still}} a baby.

After earning a scholarship, she furthered her studies at Wright State University majoring in theater arts with a dance minor. During this period, Scherzinger garnered the lead roles in regional productions of the musicals Chicago, Guys and Dolls and Show Boat.|$|E
