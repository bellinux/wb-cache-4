5|$|In genetics, a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> variant {{is associated with a}} trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.|$|E

The test began with approximately 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia, and would eventually involve 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California. By {{the conclusion of the}} study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> contracted polio.|$|E

This test involves removing {{a sample of}} tissue from a person’s inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a microscope. In addition, a sialogram, a special X-ray test, is performed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> blockage {{is present in the}} salivary gland ducts (i.e. parotid duct) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.|$|E

25|$|Transcription, in {{the context}} of cuneiform, is the process in which an epigraphist makes a line art drawing to show the signs on a clay tablet or stone {{inscription}} in a graphic form suitable for modern publication. Not all epigraphists are equally reliable, and before a scholar publishes an important treatment of a text, the scholar will often arrange to collate the published transcription against the actual tablet, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> signs, especially broken or damaged signs, should be represented differently.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} phase III {{clinical}} trials are reached, {{the formulation of}} the drug should {{have been developed to}} be close to the preparation that will ultimately be used in the market. A knowledge of stability is essential by this stage, and conditions must have been developed to ensure that the drug is stable in the preparation. If the drug proves unstable, it will invalidate the results from clinical trials since {{it would be impossible to}} know what the administered dose actually was. Stability studies are carried out to test whether temperature, humidity, oxidation, or photolysis (ultraviolet light or visible light) have any effect, and the preparation is analysed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> degradation products have been formed.|$|E
25|$|During development, it {{was found}} that the rifle was not only solidly {{designed}} and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867's 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a magazine loader, {{it was found}} that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of 4 meters (12ft) towards a rocky surface in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> of the rounds in the magazine would go off. Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.|$|E

The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not have checked the abandoned lot thoroughly since she said there were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were scared {{to reach out to the}} government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot.

The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner.

500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They {{thought it was a}} really nice, cute, warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that we take it to Disney, but we decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|E
