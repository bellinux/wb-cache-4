The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known about their behavior.

5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy {{is divided into}} macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} anatomy is {{characterized}} by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. <b>The</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, paleontological {{exploration}} intensified {{everywhere and}} {{ceased to be}} a largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 a total of 170 dinosaur genera were described. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase was due to <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in South America and Africa. Near the end of the 20th century the opening of China to systematic exploration for fossils has yielded a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals. Also study of the Chengjiang fauna, a Cambrian fossil site in China, during the 1990s has provided important clues to the origin of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> how the {{decomposition}} {{of the body}} affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old.

In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
