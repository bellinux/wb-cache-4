5|$|Another team {{rose from}} the Pacific, as had Cobreloa. Colombian club América reached three {{consecutive}} finals in 1985, 1986 and 1987 but like Cobreloa they could not manage to win a single one. In 1985, Argentinos Juniors, a small club from the neighborhood of La Paternal in Buenos Aires, astonished South America by eliminating holders Independiente in La Doble Visera 2–1 during the last decisive match of the second round, to book {{a place in the}} final. Argentinos Juniors went on to win an unprecedented title by beating America de Cali in the play-off match via a penalty shootout. After <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> 1966 and 1976, River Plate reached a third final in 1986 and were crowned champions {{for the first time ever}} after winning both legs of the final series against America de Cali, 2–1 at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero and 1–0 at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. Peñarol won the Cup again in 1987 after beating America de Cali 2–1 in the decisive playoff; it proved to be their last hurrah in the international scene as Uruguayan football, in general, suffered a great decline at the end of the 1980s. The Manyas fierce rivals, Nacional, also won one last cup in 1988 before falling from the continental limelight.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, {{after he}} was {{released}} by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but {{spent much of the}} next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> postwar European travel in a novella, Scott-King's Modern Europe. In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of Brideshead. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, The Loved One. In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.|$|E

The common reference to it has become Boulangisme, a term used by its partisans and adversaries alike. Immediately, the new popular movement was backed by notable conservative figures such as Count Arthur Dillon, Alfred Joseph Naquet, Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart (Duchess of Uzès, who financed him with immense sums), Arthur Meyer, Paul Déroulède (and his Ligue des Patriotes).|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Project 86 {{teamed with}} Slayer {{producer}} Matt Hyde {{to record their}} next album. The record was envisioned as a critique of post-9/11 America and the music industry.

[...] "Songs were written and assembled with a certain ebb and flow in mind," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I approached the album like writing chapters in a book." [...] The group spent over 14 months recording demos for Atlantic, which invested nearly $1,000,000 in the project when it was all said and done. [...] Because of the pressure to produce radio singles, the sound of the album was quite different from its previous releases, as was Schwab's cryptic lyrics, which represented <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> being stifled creatively and feeling powerless in the process.|$|E

500|$|... "Good Morning Good Morning" [...] was {{inspired}} by a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes, from which Lennon adapted a jingle as the song's refrain. The track utilises the bluesy mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with [...] "perfectly express Lennon's grievance against complacency". Lennon regarded the song as [...] "a throwaway piece of garbage", and McCartney viewed it as Lennon's reaction to <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> domestic life. Womack praises the song's varied time signatures, including 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, calling it a [...] "masterpiece of electrical energy". MacDonald notes Starr's [...] "fine performance" [...] and McCartney's [...] "coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo", which he credits with delivering the track's climax. A series of animal noises are heard during the fade-out that are sequenced – at Lennon's request – so that each successive animal is large enough to devour the preceding one. Martin spliced the sound of a chicken clucking {{at the end of the}} track to overlap with a guitar being tuned in the next one, making a seamless transition between the two songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] is a pop song lasting {{three minutes}} and twenty-six seconds. Written {{in the key}} of E major, it follows the chord {{progression}} G5—Dsus—Csus2—Dsus, beginning with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progressing to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer". In the view of Chris William of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Breakout"'s lyrics are [...] "a harangue against life's cruelest inequities", drawing attention to the opening verse, [...] "Every week's the same/Stuck in school's so lame/My parents say that I'm lazy/Getting up at 8 a.m.'s crazy/Tired of bein' told what to do/So unfair, so uncool," [...] though adding that the song {{was a sign that}} the [...] "little girl isn't growing up". However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said the song was indeed about growing up fast, referencing the lines [...] "It feels so good to let go" [...] and [...] "Wish it would never end" [...] and Jodi Rosen of Rolling Stone also believed [...] "she's venting <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> a teen who's too grown-up to submit to her parents, teachers or anyone else" [...] with the lines [...] "tired of bein' told what to do".|$|E
500|$|While his {{performance}} of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] was {{a tradition of}} his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, [...] "It's not the time or place to do it," [...] {{even though it was}} the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does. When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it." ...|$|E

500|$|A Journey drew a mixed {{reception}} from critics. Financial Times editor Lionel Barber {{called it}} [...] "part psychodrama, part treatise on <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> leadership {{in a modern}} democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of Mills & Boon". He wrote that it made Blair seem [...] "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)." [...] Writing in The Independent on Sunday, Geoffrey Beattie said A Journey offered an understanding of Blair's [...] "underlying psychology." [...] John Rentoul, author of the Blair biography Tony Blair Prime Minister, was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter on the Iraq War. [...] "The chapter on Iraq is tightly argued in some detail, which may persuade those with open minds to recognise {{that the decision to}} join the US invasion was a reasonable, if not very successful, one, rather than a conspiracy against life, the universe and everything decent," [...] he said. Mary Ann Sieghart, writing for The Independent said, [...] "whatever its faults, and toe-curling passages, [...] has many good lessons on how to succeed in both opposition and government.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{even the}} minds of reformers like Gogel had become {{receptive}} {{to the need for}} change. <b>The</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by [...] "Bonapartist" [...] means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, {{in the hands of the}} old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a [...] "National College" [...] (akin to the French Senate) from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E

500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> <b>of</b> the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E
