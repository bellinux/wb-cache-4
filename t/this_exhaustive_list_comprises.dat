Additionally, support seems to vary depending on the game being on internal flash memory or SD card.|$|R
40|$|Containing {{thousands}} of entries of both vernacular and scientific names of Great Plains plants, {{the literature that}} informs <b>this</b> <b>exhaustive</b> <b>listing</b> spans nearly 300 years. Author Elaine Nowick has drawn from sources as diverse as Linnaeus, Lewis and Clark, and local university extension publications to compile the gamut of practical, and often fanciful, common plant names used over the years. Each common name {{is accompanied by a}} definitive scientific name with references and authority information. Interspersed with scientifically-correct botanical line drawings, the entries are written in standard ICBN format, making this a useful volume for scholars as well as lay enthusiasts alike. Volume 1 presents, in alphabetical order, all the historical common names of plants recorded in Great Plains flora, herbaria, and botanical collections, together with the scientific names of species to which those common names have been applied.

Similarly, [...] means [...] "kitchen", but also refers to food or cooking generally, or a type of food or cooking.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} organizations, centers, agencies, universities, and {{laboratories}} {{public and private}} funding and conducting research on meats globally. In the broadest context, this research spans considerations of quality, safety, processing, packaging, techniques, and consumer issues. But are the needs being researched really the needs and priorities of the users whether they be the consuming public, the packing industry, equipment manufacturers, producers, etc. ? This {{is a very difficult}} question to answer categorically. The best way to answer this question is to look at some specific examples of research efforts around the world and to investigate whether the meat industry and society benefitted from the work. Time will not allow a thorough investigation outlining all the efforts underway with all meat species in even one of the most active countries let alone all of them. Therefore, only an example or two from several different regions of the world will be highlighted and discussed briefly. Before these examples are exposed, it might be appropriate to mention the listing of research and outreach needs identified by the industry. It is important for the meat industry in any country to expend the effort in a visioning exercise to forecast what those priority projects should be for the common good. The American Meat Science Association has a standing committee that reviews these needs and periodically updates a published list of meat research and extension priorities. <b>This</b> <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> provides direction to all those funding and conducting research upon what their primary focus should be in the years ahead.

40|$|Problem framing is {{recognised}} as {{an important}} new technique for describing the problem context {{in order to identify}} and then apply the most appropriate modelling and description techniques to developing different kinds of software system. Jackson has proposed five distinct problem frames and variants on them. However, Jackson makes no claim that <b>this</b> is an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list.</b> In order to better model certain problem domains, an addition to the published set of elementary problem frames is proposed. We present the Simulator problem frame and describe through example why the Simulator is not solely a variant of the other frames and should be considered a problem frame in its own right. 1...|$|R

We do not pretend that <b>this</b> is an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of methods, or that the methods we have chosen are applicable to all anonymisation problems. We try to keep the language as accessible as possible; however, some of these techniques are statistically quite complex, which in some cases is inevitably reflected in the descriptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze TV and viral {{advertisements}} in India for their reflection of traditional and contemporary cultures. In order to reach <b>this</b> purpose, an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of literature on culture and cultural values in advertisements are consulted. Using guidelines from previous research and literatures on content analysis, advertising appeals and netnography, qualitative analyses {{of the contents of}} four animated advertising videos from India and consumer comments on the same are conducted. Based on the researcher’s observations and interpretations, the study reveals that advertisements in both media reflect cultural values, but in surprisingly different ways. TV advertisements reflect new and modern values in India, whereas the supposedly radical viral advertisements tend to stick to traditional culture...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of a world-wide {{intensive}} research activity, a new design concept for structural moment resistant joints has been suggested and implemented in design codes. In the present paper, its background is first briefly described and the main contributions to its development are presented. As a matter of fact, because of the high number of past and ongoing researches, reports and papers devoted to <b>this</b> topic, an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of all these works could not be established in a limited number of pages. The possibilities of extension of the new design concepts, which have been first developed for steel beam-to-column joints under static loading, are particularly pointed out. This aspect appears quite important as in the near future it should provide designers with a unified design approach for structural joints whatever their loading, their configurations and the nature of their constitutive material(s) ...|$|R
40|$|To fully support {{distributed}} processing in any distributed system, {{it must be}} possible to perform remote executions. For maximum benefit, this should also be coupled with the movement of data and programs from sites other than those where the execution is to be performed. Such {{distributed processing}} requirements are considered {{in the context of}} a Virtual Enterprise which uses an Object-oriented Knowledge Base Management System (OOKBMS) to act not only as a trader, but also the repository for a global model and shared data. Here, the concept of objects causes us to reconsider remote execution and data movement as the more general problem of object migration. In this paper we identify, object migration consisting of the migration of three possible components: object definition, object instances, and object method executables and source. We describe in <b>this</b> paper an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>list</b> of thirteen execution and data location scenarios. The discussion in this paper on object metho [...] ...|$|R
