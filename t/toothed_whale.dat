5|$|The {{killer whale}} or orca (Orcinus orca) is a <b>toothed</b> <b>whale</b> {{belonging}} to the oceanic dolphin family, {{of which it is}} the largest member. Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Killer whales are apex predators, as there is no animal that preys on them. Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and can be found in each of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.|$|E
25|$|Toothed {{whales are}} capable of making {{a broad range of}} sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three {{categories}} of sounds can be identified: frequency-modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds, and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though {{the nature and extent of}} that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are used for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. <b>Toothed</b> <b>whale</b> biosonar clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{adaptation}} of echolocation occurred when <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> (Odontoceti) split apart from baleen whales, and distinguishes modern <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> from fully aquatic archaeocetes. This happened around 34 {{million years ago}} in a second cetacean radiation. Modern <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> do not rely on their sense of sight, but rather on their sonar to hunt prey. Echolocation also allowed <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> to dive deeper in search of food, with light no longer necessary for navigation, which opened up new food sources. Toothed whales echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies. Sound pulses are emitted, reflected off objects, and retrieved through the lower jaw. Skulls of Squalodon show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation. Squalodon lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene, around 33-14 million years ago. Squalodon featured several commonalities with modern toothed whales: the cranium was well compressed (to make room for the melon, a part of the nose), the rostrum telescoped outward into a beak, a characteristic of the modern <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> that gave Squalodon an appearance similar to them. However, it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of modern <b>toothed</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{killer whale}} {{is known to}} prey on {{numerous}} other <b>toothed</b> <b>whale</b> species. One example is the false killer whale. To subdue and kill whales, orcas continuously ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times, they corral their prey before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer killer whales, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by killer whales, but adults can be targeted, as well. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales. Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal.|$|E
25|$|Forty-six {{marine mammals}} from the order Cetacea {{are found in}} Australian coastal waters. Since the {{majority}} of these species have global distribution, some authors do not consider them to be Australian species. There are nine species of baleen whale present, including the humpback whale. There are 37 species of <b>toothed</b> <b>whale,</b> which include all six genera of the family Ziphiidae, and 21 species of oceanic dolphin, including the Australian snubfin dolphin, a species first described in 2005. Some oceanic dolphins, such as the orca, can be found in all waters around the continent; others, such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, are confined to the warm northern waters. The dugong is an endangered marine species that inhabits the waters of north-eastern and north-western Australia, particularly the Torres Strait. It can grow up to 3m long and weigh as much as 400kg. The dugong is the only herbivorous marine mammal in Australia, feeding on sea grass in coastal areas. The destruction of sea grass beds is a threat to the survival of this species.

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{view has}} been that Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) arose from more primitive whales early in the Oligocene period, and that the super-family Physeteroidea, which contains the sperm whale, dwarf sperm whale, and pygmy sperm whale, diverged from other toothed whales soon after that, over [...] From 1993 to 1996, molecular phylogenetics analyses by Milinkovitch and colleagues, based on comparing the genes of various modern whales, suggested that the sperm whales are {{more closely related to}} the baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales, which would have meant that Odontoceti were not monophyletic; in other words, it did not consist of a single ancestral <b>toothed</b> <b>whale</b> species and all its descendants.

40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine}} {{possible}} differences in neural structures involved in echolocation caused by different ecologies of two mammalian groups. Echolocation {{is the process of}} emitting sounds and deriving information from the returning echoes to be able to navigate and forage. Bats and <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> possess vastly different ecologies, but have evolved sophisticated echolocation to perceive their environment. 	 Echolocation calls for complex processing of sounds and the integration of auditory information into the motor systems in the brain and differences in ecology may be evident in involved brain structures in echolocating bats and <b>toothed</b> <b>whales.</b> In general, the auditory system is highly enlarged, with important echolocation sound parameters overrepresented. Species with a higher dependence on echolocation often show higher hypertrophy of auditory neural structures. Some remarkable adaptations are observed in bats. The MSO, normally involved in processing ITD’s in mammals, has evolved a different function in bats, most likely in prey detection and classification. The MSO in <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> is lacking in most species, {{due to the lack of}} detectable ITD’s because of high frequency echolocation sounds and faster sound carrying properties of water. Another remarkable adaptation is the VNLLc in bats, an adaptation for exact localization of objects. Similar neural substrates have been found in the VNLL and IC of <b>toothed</b> <b>whales,</b> and they possibly possess a similar function. The sensorimotor system also shows some remarkable adaptations according to ecology. The cerebellum is enlarged for movements in a 3 D environment and, at least in <b>toothed</b> <b>whales,</b> for the rapid integration of acoustic stimuli into motor functions in the aquatic environment. Different nuclei are involved in the sensorimotor system in bats and <b>toothed</b> <b>whales,</b> which can be explained through morphological differences in sound generation and sound perception. This thesis shows differences in neural structures are evident in and between echolocating bats and <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> and can be related to their respective ecologies...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Toothed</b> <b>whale</b> {{eyes are}} {{relatively}} small for their size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes are placed {{on the sides of}} its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view as humans have. When a beluga surfaces, its lenses and corneas correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. They do, however, lack short wavelength-sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells, indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most toothed whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas, and a [...] tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye, and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. In water, a whale can see around [...] ahead of itself, but they have a smaller range above water. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.|$|E

40|$|Toothed whales {{have evolved}} to live in {{extremely}} different habitats and yet they all rely strongly on echolocation for finding and catching prey. Such biosonar-based foraging involves distinct phases of searching for, approaching and capturing prey, where echolocating animals gradually adjust sonar output to actively shape the flow of sensory information. Measuring those outputs in absolute levels requires hydrophone arrays centred on the biosonar beam axis, but this has never been done for wild <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> approaching and capturing prey. Rather, field studies make the assumption that <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> will adjust their biosonar {{in the same manner}} to arrays as they will when approaching prey. To test this assumption, we recorded wild botos (Inia geoffrensis) as they approached and captured dead fish tethered to a hydrophone in front of a star-shaped seven-hydrophone array. We demonstrate that botos gradually decrease interclick intervals and output levels during prey approaches, using stronger adjustment magnitudes than predicted from previous boto array data. Prey interceptions are characterised by high click rates, but although botos buzz during prey capture, they do so at lower click rates than marine <b>toothed</b> <b>whales,</b> resulting in a much more gradual transition from approach phase to buzzing. We also demonstrate {{for the first time that}} wild <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> broaden biosonar beamwidth when closing in on prey, as is also seen in captive <b>toothed</b> <b>whales</b> and bats, thus resulting in a larger ensonified volume around the prey, probably aiding prey tracking by decreasing the risk of prey evading ensonification...|$|R
