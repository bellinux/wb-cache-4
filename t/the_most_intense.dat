5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda {{was tied}} with Cyclone Inigo for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Australian {{tropical}} cyclone on record, with a barometric pressure of 900hPa (mbar) and was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> storm worldwide in 1999. Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900hPa (mbar). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|Emilia {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} in the Eastern Pacific, with a minimum pressure of 926mbar (hPa; 27.34inHg).

5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ioke, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Ioke, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke was a record breaking, long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17days, reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on three different occasions.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Patricia set {{multiple}} {{records for}} maximum strength, rate of intensification, {{and rate of}} weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Patricia is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, {{it is also the}} second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00UTC October22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph (140km/h) to 205mph (335km/h), a record increase of 120mph (195km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95mbar (hPa; 2.81inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.52inHg).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Wilma was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, with an atmospheric pressure of 882hPa (mbar, 26.05inHg). Wilma's destructive journey {{began in the}} second week of October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea and gradually organized to the southeast of Jamaica. By late on October 15, the system was sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center to designate it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes {{have reached}} Category5 {{intensity}} during every month from June to October. The earliest Category5 {{to form in}} a season is 1973's Hurricane Ava, which formed on June7. The latest Category5 to form in a season is Hurricane Kenna, which reached peak intensity on October 24. Hurricanes Ava, Gilma, Ioke, Linda, and Patricia are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> storms to form in their respective months. There have been no May, November, or off-season Category5 hurricanes.|$|E

50|$|In {{the warm}} {{waters of the}} Caribbean, Dean rapidly {{strengthened}} into a Category 5 hurricane with 165 mi/h km/h sustained winds. This made it the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma—and it was tied for <b>the</b> seventh <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic storm of all time. An eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dean, which then passed just south of Jamaica as a Category 4 hurricane. Dean regained Category 5 status late on August 20 and at that strength it made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico near Costa Maya on August 21. Hurricane Dean was the first storm to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. A dropsonde {{in the eye of}} the storm estimated a central pressure of 905 mbar, tying Dean with hurricanes Camille and Mitch for <b>the</b> seventh <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. Dean was <b>the</b> third <b>most</b> <b>intense</b> landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988). Dean weakened over land, but re-intensified slightly in the Gulf of Mexico. It made its final landfall near Tecolutla, Veracruz on August 22, dissipating the next day.|$|R
