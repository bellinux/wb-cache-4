This simple two-paragraph act, approved on 21 November 1946 and announced on 27 November 1946, authorised the government to implement winter time by ordinance at any time. The government gave as {{the main reason for}} this provision the fact that power plants had approximately 10% lack of capacity in peak hours (7-8 and 16-20) and winter time should help to spread <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{seats that}} the drivers sit in have {{evolved over the}} past few years. Most of the seats found in the race cars wrap around the driver's rib cage.

Some of the newer seats wrap around the driver's shoulders as well, which provides better support because the shoulders are more durable than the rib cage. The introduction of carbon fiber seats has also helped improve safety, as carbon fiber absorbs more energy from an impact than the traditional aluminum seats.|$|E

As reinforcements cannot be called for during a mission, proper troop selection is important for each mission. Each dropship that can be loaded out with troops, up to a maximum of three depending on progress in the single player campaign, can carry a maximum of four squads each, with each squad consisting of units picked from one of four unit categories - vehicles, support, aircraft, and infantry - and of a specific role within the chosen category; one exception to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>out</b> is the Command APC, which must be brought along on each mission, but does not take space away from another squad.|$|E

5000|$|Grant {{was moved}} by the {{injuries}} and mutilations he saw to street animals, particularly draught cattle and horses, inflicted mostly by their owners and keepers. The founding meeting for the Society met on the 4th October 1861 and was chaired by Archdeacon Pratt. The other twenty attendees included Alexander Duff, Dr Mouat, Major C. Herbert, and several others including an Armenian (later the first non-European sheriff of Calcutta for 1866) Seth Arratoon Apcar; Indians Peary Chand Mittra, S. P. Sagrande, M. Rustomjee, Rajali Pertaup Chunder Sing Bahadoor and Moulvie Abdool Lotiff. The aim of the society was to [...] "prevent the cruel and improper treatment of animals, and the amelioration of their condition generally throughout India" [...] by among others establishing paid European officers to enforce those who were guilty of ill-treating animals and educating the public. Lord Elgin later became a Patron of the society. Grant published a text for children on animal cruelty {{that was to be}} used in Sunday schools. One of the major causes of injury to draught animals was overloaded carts. The Municipal Commissioners of Calcutta were forced to use improved carts with a single bullock having leather collars while the Indian Carrying Company began to use four-wheeled carts that took <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>out</b> of the animals. Around 1877 two more societies were established at Madras and Bangalore. Towards {{the end of his life}} Grant received an Honorary Diploma from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A memorial obelisk was erected near Writers' Building in Calcutta with a watering trough at its base for animals. His position as secretary was succeeded by Peary Chand Mittra who also wrote a biography of Grant.|$|E
5000|$|The year 2010 {{marked the}} next {{milestone}} in rolling out the M5000 turbine with the Tripod foundation. The two projects Borkum West II and Global Tech I decided to erect their farms using this technology platform. 40 Tripods were ordered by each project in first instance nearly {{at the same}} time. Anticipating this demand WeserWind has developed a serial production approach for Tripods in the years before, together with Dr. Möller GmbH / IMS Nord, Bremerhaven. The key parameters of this approach are the upright assembly concept, the setup of an assembly line with up to nine work stations, the transportation of the growing structures on behalf of heavy load rail carriers along the assembly line and the integrated load out operation to a tailor made pontoon. Based on this concept Georgsmarienhütte released the investment program building this assembly shop with two parallel lines at Lunedeich, Bremerhaven. The building was operational {{in the beginning of}} 2011 and in June the first Borkum-West II-Tripod was completed. In December 2011 the pontoon was baptised and the offshore terminal ABC-Peninsula was commissioned by BLG Logistics Solutions GmbH & Co. KG after essential upgrading. Finally 100 Tripods have been built at this site in the years from 2011 to 2013. The cycle time for the whole plant was reached with down to five calendar days per structure. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> <b>out</b> cycle was achieved to four hours. Also SIAG Emden and the consortium Iemants N.V. with Eiffage Construction Métallique S.A.S. in Vlissingen produced in total 20 Tripods in that time in upright position. The offshore transportation technology has been developed significantly since Alpha Ventus. The Offshore Construction Jack Up “Innovation” by HGO InfraSea Solutions GmbH & Co. KG was commissioned in 2012 and did her first job for Global Tech 1 carrying three Tripods and pile sets per sail. The crane ships “Stanislaw Yudin” and “Oleg Strassnow” by SHL Seaway Heavy Lifting were in operation for Borkum West II.|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} report is to verify that the Edvard Grieg jacket {{structure}} has sufficient strength to withstand the loads imposed during <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>out</b> operation at Kv&# 230;rner Verdal.

In <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>out</b> analysis the jacket model is supported on top of 800 mm long box members (pins) at each jacket launch runner leg main- and intermediate nodes in the launch runner area, i. e. 12 supports at each leg, ref.

Temporary Phases?, ref. [7]. Description of differential settlements applied is given in chapter 5. 1. 4. 2. 2. The code checks of the jacket are performed according to NORSOK standards, ref.

40|$|The way {{a system}} reacts to {{increased}} task demands can reveal information about its functional mechanism. We therefore assessed the question how non human primates process information about visual stimuli by driving two rhesus monkeys to their cognitive limits in a visual memory task. The monkeys were first trained to successfully perform the visual memory task (> 80 correct responses). Then {{the number of}} stimuli shown to the monkey (load) was increased to up to 4. The stimulus presentation period (SP) was 900 milliseconds long. Thus, in the load 4 condition each single stimulus was only shown for less than 225 ms. After a three second delay period, a test stimulus was shown. The task of the monkey was then to decide via differential button press, whether the test stimulus matched any of the previously shown stimuli. Neuronal firing rates were recorded using up to 16 multi electrodes placed in the prefrontal cortex. For every trial in which the monkey responded correctly, the average multi unit rate during the SP was estimated. We then assessed the question whether the firing rates in the SP during the distinct load conditions were significantly different. To minimize the effect of non-stationarities present in the data, we paired the data so that the trials of one pair were maximally 2. 5 minutes apart. We tested against the null-hypothesis that the firing rates during the SP {{did not differ significantly}} among the load conditions using the nonparametric Friedman-test for paired data. For every recording site where we could reject the null-hypothesis (p< 0. 05), we investigated in which direction the rates of the different load conditions differed, correcting for multiple tests using the Tukey-Kramer-correction. A total of 12681 correct trials were recorded with a total of 160 recording positions (6 to 16 per session). In total, 23 positions showed significant effects from which 20 were consistent. The firing rate differences were called consistent if the difference compared to load 1 were stronger the higher <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> <b>Out</b> of these 20 consistent recording sites 14 showed a firing rate which monotonically increased with the load, 6 showed a monotonous decrease. This means that 12 of the recording sites in prefrontal cortex show a significant modulation of firing rates with respect to the load condition during a delayed match to sample task. However this modulation is not necessarily excitatory. Interestingly, it seems that the majority of sites showed a load-consistent modulation i. e. the higher the load, the stronger the modulation. This could be a possible mechanism to code the number of stimuli or their sequence...|$|E
