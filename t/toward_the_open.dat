5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest {{and entered the}} ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
25|$|The active {{sites of}} {{tyrosine}} kinases {{each have a}} binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is {{the transfer of the}} terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> or active conformation.|$|E
25|$|Integration {{with the}} setting extends even to small details. For example, where glass meets stone walls no metal frame is used; rather, {{the glass and}} its {{horizontal}} dividers were run into a caulked recess in the stonework so that the stone walls appear uninterrupted by glazing. From the cantilevered living room, a stairway leads directly down to the stream below, and in a connecting space which connects the main house with the guest and servant level, a natural spring drips water inside, which is then channeled back out. Bedrooms are small, some with low ceilings to encourage people outward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> social areas, decks, and outdoors.|$|E

25|$|Despite Maimon's order, the Wedgwood {{continued}} {{chasing the}} Egyptian corvette while coming {{under fire from}} the aircraft. At 12:25, its bow cannon was damaged, and it turned and fired from the stern, then around again when the bow cannon was repaired. The Haganah turned to assist the Wedgwood, but at 13:40 the Egyptian coastal battery came online and started firing at the Haganah. The Haganah turned around again <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea. The Wedgwood was also hit by the shore cannons, suffering minor damage. At this point the corvette {{had gone out of}} range and the Wedgwood began to retreat north, but Egyptian Spitfires attacked it, dropping three bombs, one of which wounded a crew member.|$|E
2500|$|For 65 minutes, Oregon pursued Cristóbal Colón. which {{hugged the}} coast {{and was unable to}} turn <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea because Oregon was {{standing}} out about [...] from Cristóbal Colóns course and {{would have been able to}} fatally close the gap had Cristóbal Colón turned to a more southerly course.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of his}} {{reconstruction}} of the Roman Forum in 44 BC, Julius Caesar {{is believed to have}} moved the republican Rostra Vetera. This Rostra, referred to as the [...] "Rostra Nova" [...] or [...] "Caesarian Rostra", reused and incorporated nearly all of the original Rostra. Located on the southwest side of the new Julian Forum (Forum Iulium), the new Rostra was no longer subordinated to his new Senate House, the Curia Julia (still standing); Caesar had it placed on the central axis of the Forum, facing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> space. Left uncompleted at Caesar's death, Augustus finished and extended the new Rostra into a rectangle at the front. Traces of this Rostra can be seen today.|$|E

50|$|A {{very rare}} type of non-lake {{dwelling}} stromatolite {{lives in the}} Nettle Cave at Jenolan Caves, NSW, Australia.

60|$|He stood up, tall, gaunt, great-boned and gnarled, {{a splendid}} ruin of a man.

He moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>opened</b> it, sighed, and paused with a backward look.|$|R
