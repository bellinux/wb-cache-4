5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at {{the quarry}} were stopped in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts to reopen <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> flooded.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{attempts}} to estimate <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> export and import structures and their income and price elasticities in Turkey. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> export indicated a significantly cubic relationship {{with respect to}} <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> terms of trade adjusted U.

Dollar exchange rates and significantly linear relationships with respect to (i) the world wholesale prices (ii) <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> domestic wholesale prices and (iii) the world output in natural logarithmic terms. However, <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> import indicated a significantly parabolic relationship with respect to <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> terms of trade adjusted U. S. Dollar exchange rates, a significantly cubic relationship {{with respect to the}} world wholesale prices and a linear relationship with respect to the domestic output in natural logarithmic terms. <b>The</b> estimated <b>mining</b> import and export models exhibited a long-run relationship in the variables. However, some variables indicated are found contradictory to the theory in causality of directions. <b>The</b> estimated <b>mining</b> world export demand world output elasticity ranged between 4. 6 and 7. 66. <b>The</b> estimated <b>mining</b> import domestic output elasticity ranged between 0. 8 and 1. 34. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> export was found more income elastic than <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> import. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> export was found inelastic with respect to <b>the</b> domestic <b>mining</b> prices. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> export sectoral term of trade adjusted U.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mining</b> {{boundary}} angle, {{as one of}} {{the basic}} parameters of subsidence, is used a lot of methods at prediction calculation of movements and deformations. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> boundary angle is used at determining so called the pillar angles at the protected pillar of warehouses on the earth surface. This mining boundary angle together with <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> depth characterises <b>the</b> subsidence measure on the earth surface. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> boundary angle depends upon geological, hydrogeological relations and deformability of rock massif, upon excavation technology etc. The presented paper deals with determining <b>the</b> <b>mining</b> boundary angle on a base of geodetic measurements on the monitoring network points in the coalfield - OKR in the Czech Republic. <b>The</b> <b>mining</b> boundary angles of two monitoring stations: Stonava and Karvina-Solca are determined.

5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It stated that <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> was hot {{with high levels}} of coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused <b>the</b> <b>mine</b> to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E

After a major dispute with the Stormont Mining Company, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed to support wages. Gambling, prostitution, and shootouts were also commonplace.

The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the mining company.
