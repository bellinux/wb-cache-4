There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> 2015.

5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice.

5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>In</b> certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{epidemic}} {{model is}} proposed to describe <b>the</b> dynamics of <b>disease</b> spread between two patches due to population dispersal. It is proved that reproduction number is a {{threshold of the}} uniform persistence and disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> It is found that the dispersal rates of susceptible individuals do not influence the persistence and extinction of <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, if <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> becomes extinct <b>in</b> each patch when the patches are isolated, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> remains extinct when the population dispersal occurs; if <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> spreads <b>in</b> each patch when the patches are isolated, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> remains persistent <b>in</b> two patches when the population dispersal occurs; if <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> disappears <b>in</b> one patch and spreads in the other patch when they are isolated, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> can spread <b>in</b> all the patches or disappear in all the patches if dispersal rates of infectious individuals are suitably chosen. It is shown that an endemic equilibrium is locally stable if susceptible dispersal occurs and infectious dispersal turns off. If susceptible individuals and infectious individuals have the same dispersal rate in each patch, it is shown that the fractions of infectious individuals converge to a unique endemic equilibrium...|$|R
