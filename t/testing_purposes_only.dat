40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} test case {{selection}} from axiomatic speci cations whose axioms are quanti er-free rst-order formulas with equality. We rst prove {{the existence of}} an ideal exhaustive test set to start the selection from. We then propose an extension of the test selection method called axiom unfolding, originally de ned for algebraic speci cations, to quanti er-free rst-order speci cations with equality. This method basically consists of a case analysis of the property under <b>test</b> (the <b>test</b> <b>purpose)</b> according to the speci cation axioms. It is based on a proof search for the di erent instances of the <b>test</b> <b>purpose,</b> thus allowing a sound and complete coverage of this property. The generalisation we propose allows to deal with any kind of predicate (not only equality) and with any form of axiom and <b>test</b> <b>purpose</b> (not <b>only</b> equations or Horn clauses). Moreover, it improves our previous works with e ciently dealing with the equality predicate, thanks to the paramodulation rule...|$|R

In an effort to provide a sound underpinning of an improved ASR planning framework, a review of 50 ASR projects {{from around the world}} was undertaken in order to provide fundamental data and lessons learned.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a quick}} reference to the C-stolic language and to the C-stolic compiler freeware provided for UNIX workstations. 1 1 Introduction C-stolic was first designed for programming a linear systolic array: the MicMacs machine [3]. Then the C-stolic compiler evolved to support simulation of systolic algorithms on parallel machines [6], such as the iPSC/ 2 [2], the iWarp [9], the ArMen machine [4] or the MasPar [1]. In addition, a simulator running on UNIX workstations has been developed for <b>testing</b> and debugging <b>purposes.</b> <b>Only</b> the simulator is provided within the freeware. It allows programmers to easily design, experiment, and validate systolic algorithms. Currently, C-stolic supports only the linear topology architecture. The use of the C-stolic simulator is straightforward. The programmer writes one or several C-stolic procedures and calls them from a main C program. The compilation process is reduced to a single command, {{as compared to the}} normal use of the C-stolic compi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|At {{submicron}} channel lengths, CMOS is {{an attractive}} alternative to silicon bipolar and GaAs MESFET technologies for use in wireless receivers. A 12 mW global positioning system (GPS) receiver front-end, comprising a low noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer implemented in a standard 0. 35 µm digital CMOS process, demonstrates the aptitude of CMOS for portable wireless appli-cations. A block diagram of the receiver front-end test is shown in Figure 1. The system consists of a LNA, mixer, buffer (for <b>testing</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>only),</b> and associated bias circuitry. Note that the LNA output and mixer input are taken off-chip to facilitate testing of each block individually. To achieve a wide dynamic range, the noise figure of the LNA and linearity of the mixer are of primary concern. Figure 2 shows the circuit schematic of the LNA. A differential architecture is chosen in anticipation of eventual integration of a complete GPS receiver. Its common mode rejection eases the task of rejecting interference from other on-chip elements, such as a DSP core. This choice results in increased amplifier noise for a given power dissipation compared to a single-ended implementation. This increase is mitigated by the high ωT of the process, that permits acceptable noise performance despite a differential implementation. The input stage, consisting of M 1, 2 and L 1, 2, uses inductive source degeneration to generate a real term in the differential input impedance equal to ωT(L 1 +L 2) that can be matched to the off-chip transmission lines from the image-reject filter. By resonating the input capacitance of the amplifier, the minimum possible noise figure can also be achieved [1]. A minimum exists due {{to the presence of}} induced gate noise in MOS devices, as described in Reference 2. The source degeneration inductors, L 1, 2, are imple-mented as on-chip spiral inductors.

40|$|By the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) nearly {{worldwide}} digital height {{models have}} been generated. The SRTM height models {{can be used for}} several applications, but it has gaps in mountainous regions, caused by the radar layover, and is not so accurate in steep areas. In addition the grid width of 3 arcsec, corresponding to approximately 92 m at the equator, is limiting the morphologic details. From the very high resolution optical space sensors {{only a limited number of}} stereo pairs, taken from the same orbit, are available. The automatic matching of images taken with significant time interval is very difficult and not leading to satisfying results. In addition stereo pairs from IKONOS, QuickBird and the former OrbView- 3 are expensive. The stereo pairs from the SPOT HRS only have been available for <b>test</b> <b>purposes,</b> usually <b>only</b> the derived height models can be bought, but they may be critical in forest areas (Büyüksalih, Jacobsen 2008). As alternative solution the stereo sensors Cartosat- 1 and ALOS/PRISM are now available; both systems with 2. 5 m ground sampling distance (GSD). Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been used for automatic image matching, leading even in forest areas to good results. Of course by matching as well as with the SRTM C-band and X-band digital surface models (DSMs) are generated, representing the visible surface. In most cases digital elevation models (DEMs) are requested, showing the height of the bare ground. DSMs can be filtered to DEMs if enough points of the bare ground are available. The height models based on Cartosat- 1 stereo pairs have been analyzed, including filtering. Partially it was necessary to shift the reference to the corresponding location...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} the efficiency and precision of computer classification and adaptive testing to elicit responses from test coordinators on implementing a high-stakes computer-based testing. Test coordinators from five elementary schools located in a Georgia school district participated in the study. The school district administered state-made, high-stakes tests using paper and pencil; locally developed tests via the computer or paper and pencil. A post-hoc simulation program, Comprehensive Simulation of Computerized Adatpive Testing, used 586 student item responses to produce results with a variable termination point and classification termination point. Results from the simulation were analyzed and used in the case study to elicit interview responses from test coordinators. The photographs of computer-labs and test schedule documents were collected and analyzed to validate school test coordinators 2 ̆ 7 responses. Test coordinators responded positively to the efficiency and precision of simulation results.

40|$|The {{need for}} storing and {{transferring}} digital image data is still growing nowadays. The Compression {{is necessary to}} achieve effective usage of transfer and storage capacity. This Bachelor’s Thesis is concerned with compression method based on wavelet packet transform, which is derived from wavelet transform. It is focused especially on best basis search algorithms from whole wavelet packet tree. There is a comparison between 6 best basis and near-best basis search criterions by R. R. Coifman, M. V.

The program was created for <b>testing</b> and demonstrative <b>purpose</b> <b>only</b> and that’s why it contains certain limitation such as only black and white image processing and its limited resolution. There is applied constant threshold on testing image after the several best basis criterions application. The Mean Squared Error is used for comparing outcome quality of compressed and original image. The function that acquires minimal Mean Squared Error is considered the best best-basis search criterion in term of visual quality. The results show that some of the Taswell’s functions significantly improve the visual quality of the image at the price of worse compression ratio against common Shannon entropy...|$|R
