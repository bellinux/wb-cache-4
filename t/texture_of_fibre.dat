40|$|The {{orientation}} distribution (morphological <b>texture)</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> in {{a composite}} {{is very important}} in determining the properties of the material. Therefore, methods which can provide quantitative descriptions <b>of</b> the morphological <b>texture</b> are essential. One approach to determining the morphological texture function (MTF) is to measure the orientation distribution of the crystals in the fibres. Since many types <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> used for reinforcements are crystalline and textured (i. e. carbon fibres, steel fibres, etc.) this approach may be interesting for commercial/industrial applications. For this technique to be applied, the crystallographic texture intrinsic to the fibres must be determined and subsequently, measurements of the 'global' crystallographic texture should be made in the composite. The morphological texture can then be calculated by a deconvolution <b>of</b> the composite <b>texture</b> with the fibre's crystallographic texture. The deconvolution is most easily performed using the series expansion representation <b>of</b> <b>texture</b> functions. In this paper, the morphological texture was determined in a woven fabric made from bundle drawn AISI 316 L stainless steel fibres embedded in an Al- 13 wt% Si alloy matrix. Straight fibres removed from the fabric serve as the reference material for the deconvolution. Neutron diffraction pole figures were used to determine the MTF's...|$|R

In-vitro tests performed on fibres deposited at the same mg/L concentrations show that the toxic potential follows a curvilinear increasing trend with a decreasing rate. Since the range of sizes <b>of</b> single <b>fibres</b> and their mineralogy are constant, this decreasing rate can be only attributed to the increasing amount <b>of</b> agglomerated <b>fibres.</b> Hence, single versus agglomerated fibre population is a factor that cannot be neglected in defining the final adverse effects of asbestos.

40|$|The {{orientation}} distribution or 'morphological <b>texture</b> function' (MTF) <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> {{is determined}} from measurements <b>of</b> the crystallographic <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> themselves. From neutron diffraction pole-figure measurements <b>of</b> the <b>fibres</b> in the composite and X-ray diffraction pole figures <b>of</b> the individual <b>fibres,</b> the MTF {{is determined by}} a deconvolution. To account for errors in the expansion coefficients due to measurement uncertainties, the deconvolution is performed simultaneously with a positivity criterion {{in the form of}} a set of linear equations which may be solved by a least-squares method. This approach is validated using a model system of AISI 316 L stainless-steel fibres in an Al- 13 wt% Si eutectic casting alloy. The fibres had been spun into yarns and subsequently woven to form a textile. The composite was made by infiltrating a 'brick' containing several layers of the textile with the Al alloy. The results of the deconvolution procedure show that the method indeed yields the expected morphological texture.

Protection from hail, wind, snow, or strong rainfall in fruit-farming and ornamentals, shading nets for greenhouses, or nets for moderately modifying the microenvironment are the most common applications. A systematic review of the current state-of-the-art of structural parameters, standard and regulations, most common agricultural applications of nets and their supporting structures has been developed by means of a literature study, technical investigations, interviews with permeable covering producers, specialised greenhouse builders and growers, who are familiar with permeable cladding applications. The interviews were based on questionnaires concerning characteristics, use and disposal of nets. As a result, the survey highlighted that in many cases different, not even similar, net typologies were adopted for the same application and the same cultivations by various growers. Results show that neither growers nor net producers have clear ideas about the relationship between the net typology optimisation for a specific function and the construction parameters of the net. The choice still depends often on empirical or economic criteria and not on scientific considerations.

40|$|The current {{codes for}} the design of RC {{structures}} are based exclusively on the characteristic compressive strength f’c of the concrete mix and ignore completely its tensile capacity. This means that as the tensile strength and the brittleness of concrete increase with an increase in f’c, the minimum reinforcement required to attain the required ductility has to be increased without utilising the higher tensile strength. This often leads to wastage of reinforcement and to severe congestion, especially near joints which in turn leads to a lack of adequate compaction and cover, i. e. to honeycombing. To avoid this we propose a completely new design philosophy based not on f’c but on the characteristic length lch of the concrete mix. The mix characteristic length was first introduced more than three decades back by Hillerborg based on the concepts of fracture mechanics. It involves three independent properties of the mix; its stiffness (E), tensile strength f’t and specific fracture energy or toughness GF [lch = (E GF) /(f’t) 2]. It captures the intrinsic ductility of the mix; the larger the lch, the more ductile the mix. It is clear from the definition of lch that it decreases as f’c (and therefore f’t) increases. The new design philosophy proposes to base the design on a fixed lch of concrete mix used irrespective of its f’c. Thus, if the base lch is chosen to correspond to a mix with f’c = 40 MPa, but in the actual RC structure a mix with f’c = 100 MPa is used whose lch would be much smaller than the base value, then it must be increased to coincide with the base value. In turn this means that the minimum reinforcement required for RC structures of same geometry made of mixes with different f’c but the same lch will be the same and these structures will exhibit similar ductile response. As the stiffness E increases only marginally with an increase in f’c (i. e. f’t) {{it is clear that the}} toughness GF of the mix must be increased to compensate for the reduction in lch caused by the increase in f’t. This is achieved by the addition <b>of</b> steel <b>fibres.</b> The amount <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> to be added will depend on f’t of the mix and on the type and <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>fibre</b> used. This paper will summarise the research done over the past six years in Cardiff University on different RC members (long and short beams, slender columns) made from mixes with f’c = 40 and 100 MPa to test the validity of this new design philosophy.

The chemical composition of the matrix precursor determined the type of microstructure developed in the composite, this microstructure seems to govern the fibre-matrix bonding and in turn controls the fracture behaviour of the composite.

40|$|AbstractThe biaxial {{deformation}} of a ferritic sheet steel has been examined using high energy in situ X-ray diffraction. A purpose built biaxial loading mechanism was constructed to enable deformation {{across a wide}} range of strain ratios. Three nominal deformation conditions were compared: (1) uniaxial loading, ∊TD/∊RD=-ν, (2) biaxial deformation where ∊TD/∊RD= 0. 4, and (3) approximately balanced biaxial deformation, with ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5. This novel setup allowed the full Debye–Scherrer diffraction rings to be acquired during arbitrary selected strain-paths, permitting lattice strains and reflection intensities to be measured across an unrivalled grain orientation range for such deformation conditions. This experiment reveals that the accumulation of lattice strain during deformation, as a function of azimuthal angle, is highly sensitive to strain path. For the ∊TD/∊RD= 1. 5 strain path, whilst lattice strain accumulates most rapidly in the ∊TD direction during early stages of plastic deformation, the lattice strain is shown to distribute almost perfectly isotropically for the observed orientations when plastic strain is high. This was found to be in contrast to strain paths where ∊TD/∊RD≪ 1. 5, demonstrating that lattice strain magnitudes remain highest in the direction parallel to the tensile axis with the highest applied load. Furthermore, the technique provides the capability to observe the evolution <b>of</b> <b>texture</b> <b>fibres</b> via changes in reflection intensity during different applied strain ratios...|$|R
