5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. <b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E

25|$|It wasn't a {{surprise}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> really wasn't. I didn't {{really have any}} relationship with the AD. The guy — you guys saw him (Sunday) — the guy's a total p----. I mean, he is. He's a total c---.|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L.

25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly {{then he would have}} cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
5000|$|According to the 9/11 Commission Report, {{after the}} plane's voice data {{recorder}} was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. [...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey! Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush had given the order to shoot the plane down had it continued its path to Washington.|$|R

25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> did not seem very kind.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> is a kind of liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and applelike fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E

500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, but <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is a medicine. I keep {{it around and}} take it when I need it. But {{there is no excuse}} whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Cruise {{appeared}} in the highly popular German-Swiss-Austrian TV show, Wetten, dass. Cruise had already left the show, when German comedian Michael Mittermeier said: [...] "In an interview, Tom Cruise claimed {{that he would have}} killed Hitler, too. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> would be sufficient if he had killed the Führer of Scientology." [...] Prior to the show, members of the Christian Democratic Junge Union protested against the broadcaster for being uncritical about Scientology.|$|E

500|$|Morrison did not {{excel at}} academics, and focused instead on music. He practised his music in solitude, {{and was not}} skilled at socialising. [...] "One time he said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> wasn't that he didn't want to talk, but tunes were running through his head all the time. He said he didn't know whether he'd been blessed or cursed because the words and music wouldn't go out of his head," [...] said his mother Violet.|$|E
500|$|... "When I got {{the song}} and the lyrics, I {{thought it was an}} {{incredible}} song... And, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> {{turned out to be a}} country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a {{song about}} romance, it was about me and Jim Steinman. We'd had a load of {{problems}} with managers in the early '80s {{and all of a}} sudden after five years we started to communicate. After I'd been to his house, he sent me the song, and it was [...] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now". Not the line 'When you kiss me like that', but the emotional connection. It doesn't have to be literal.|$|E

500|$|On February 20, {{the colonists}} {{set foot on}} land {{for the first time}} in three months since leaving Santo Domingo. They set up a {{temporary}} camp near the site of the present-day Matagorda Island Lighthouse. The chronicler of the expedition, Henri Joutel, described his first view of Texas: [...] "The country did not seem very favorable <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> was flat and sandy but did nevertheless produce grass. There were several salt pools. We hardly saw any wild fowl except some cranes and Canadian geese which were not expecting us." ...|$|E
500|$|Leigh first {{appeared}} on the show {{during the last two}} episodes of the third season as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie Grey. Following Isaiah Washington's departure who portrayed Preston Burke, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie. She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for the fourth season. On casting Chyler Leigh as Lexie, Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out—she had a quality that felt right and real <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. <b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it's</b> {{purely a}} {{question}} of luck. Either you're lucky or you're not. Look at me, for instance. What is there about <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make a wonderful girl love me?" ...|$|R
