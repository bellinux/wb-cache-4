5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|For voice casting, the {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to say, so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E
5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E

5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to sing it.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 6th century, Pope Gregory I {{dispatched}} a mission under Augustine of Canterbury to convert the Anglo-Saxons, establish new sees and churches throughout their territories, and reassert papal authority over the native church. Gregory intended for Augustine to become the metropolitan bishop over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferencesknown as the Synod of Chesterthat attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The Northumbrian cleric Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the Kingdom of Kent that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' obsolete method for calculating Easter; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly. Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond. He told them to respond based on Augustine's conduct: were he to rise to greet them, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> him for a humble servant of Christ and should submit to his authority but, were he to remain seated, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> him to be arrogant and prideful and should reject him. As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more advanced method of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons. The British clerics rejected all of these, as well as Augustine's authority over them. John Edward Lloyd argues that the primary reason for the British bishops' rejection of Augustine – and especially his call for them to join his missionary effort – was his claim to sovereignty over them, given that his see would be so deeply entwined with Anglo-Saxon Kent.|$|E
25|$|No {{treaties}} {{were ever}} made in BC, and although Governor Douglas planned to create them, {{the gold rush}} and subsequent immigration rush hindered this. The main goal of his plan was the assimilation of the Stó:lō into European culture. He hoped to have Stó:lō pre-empt crown land for agricultural development and have them lease out parts of the reserves to non-Aboriginal farmers to aid in assimilation. While waiting {{to be able to}} negotiate treaties, which were a very expensive process, he attempted to create large Indian reserves of at least 40 hectares per family. Douglas also promised the Stó:lō fair compensation for all the land outside of the reserves being occupied by settlers. While setting up the reserves the Stó:lō were asked to help mark the territories themselves as it was recognized that only <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> what lands needed to be included such as berry patches, transformer sites, and burial grounds (although many spiritual sites were revealed to ensure their secrecy). Sergeant William McColl was directed in 1864 by Douglas to create the reserves. The surveyors outlined 15,760 hectors through present day Abbotsford, Chilliwack, and Mission. This may seem like a large amount of land, but was small in comparison to the land available to settlers.|$|E

500|$|In May 2012 Daft Punk's {{collaboration}} with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue {{about his life}} {{for use in a}} track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted {{to tell the story of}} my life. Then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> what to do with it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|While the video's metamessage {{was clearly}} threatening, it {{remained}} too vague {{to draw any}} definitive conclusions about what the makers' intent might have been. Since it was publicized {{a few weeks before}} Halloween, there was speculation that it could be an Internet prank related to the holiday. After initially being disturbed when the threatening messages were decoded, Krahbichler said, [...] "I'm starting to think again it's just an elaborate joke". However, he did not think it was one aimed at him specifically, since if the sender [...] "knew me personally, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> I don't have the expertise to crack it, at least not the whole thing".|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team learned—some nine {{weeks prior to}} the start of filming—of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the Duke. They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes. Hooper said some of the film's most memorable lines, such as at the climax, when Logue smiles, [...] "You still stammered on the W" [...] to the King, who replies, [...] "I had to throw in a few so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> it was me" [...] were direct quotations from Logue's notes. Changes from the script to reflect the historical record included Michael Gambon improvising the ramblings of George V as he signed away authority, and the decision in the opening scene to dress the Duke in an overcoat rather than regal finery.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God told the Israelites that during all the 40 years that they {{spent in the}} wilderness, God {{did not make it}} {{necessary}} for them to escape. Rather, God cast their enemies down before them. As [...] reports, there were numerous snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions in the wilderness, but God did not allow them to harm the Israelites.

2500|$|In the 1960s, acting {{upon the}} {{information}} of KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, the CIA counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed KGB had moles in two key places—the counter-intelligence section of CIA and the FBI's counter-intelligence department—through whom <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> of, and control, US counter-espionage {{to protect the}} moles and hamper the detection and capture of other Communist spies. Moreover, KGB counter-intelligence vetted foreign intelligence sources, so that the moles might [...] "officially" [...] approve an anti-CIA double agent as trustworthy. In retrospect, the captures of the moles Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen proved that Angleton, though ignored as over-aggressive, was correct, {{despite the fact that}} it cost him his job at CIA, which he left in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Charles Manson {{told his}} {{followers}} that several White Album songs including [...] "Helter Skelter" [...] {{were a part}} of the Beatles' coded prophecy of an apocalyptic war in which racist and non-racist whites would be manoeuvred into virtually exterminating each other over the treatment of blacks. Upon the war's conclusion, after black militants would kill off the few whites <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> to have survived, Manson and his companions would emerge from an underground city in which they would have escaped the conflict. As the only remaining whites, they would rule blacks, who, as the vision went, would be incapable of running America.

2500|$|Several reasons {{have been}} put forward that {{may have contributed to}} why Klinghoffer was chosen. Earlier in the {{hijacking}} he had refused to be silent when gunmen took his watch and cigarettes, becoming brusque and complaining in his slurred speech which antagonized some of the hijackers though one of them gave Klinghoffer his possessions back. Additionally Klinghoffer was Jewish and American, and his wheelchair made him both hard to move around the ship and meant his extended absence from the main group was less likely to trigger a chain reaction of resistance among the surviving hostages. Molqi later gave a statement on why he was chosen [...] "I and Bassm [...] agreed that the first hostage to be killed had to be an American. I chose Klinghoffer, an invalid, so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> that we had no pity for anyone, just as the Americans, arming Israel, do not take into consideration that Israel kills women and children of our people." ...|$|E
