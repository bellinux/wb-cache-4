5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the ink is rolled across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|E

25|$|The graphic {{timetable}} is a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> {{of the train}} journeys. Time is displayed horizontally from midnight XII o'clock to midnight XII o'clock. The stations along the journey, from Zug and Lucerne to Chiasso, Locarno and Luino are displayed vertically. The first scheduled train, an express train with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages, leaves Bellinzona at 03:17am. The train with the number55 {{is powered by a}} steam locomotive and, according to the timetable, does not make a scheduled stop at Giubiasco, Rivera-Bironico and Taverne. Arrival at Lugano is scheduled at 04:09am, from where it leaves again at 04:14am. In 1899 the entire train journey from Bellinzona to Lugano was scheduled to be 52minutes. Today(2017), the same journey on one of the EC trains takes 27 minutes. The illustrations shows that between Giubiasco and Rivera Bironico trains do not pass each other as in 1899 this was, as mentioned in the paragraph above, a single track line. This information can thus be drawn form both, the stations' track layout and the {{graphic timetable}}. Also visible on the graphic timetable is the fact that between Osogna and Biasca, trains however do pass each other along their journeys, it being a double-track line. Further, the Arth-Rigi-Bahn's trains (nowadays Rigi Railways), are also listed in the Gotthard railways' timetable. The timetable's scale is 15mm/hour horizontally and 1.75mm/km vertically.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Peter Hughes, Holden's {{manager of}} {{exterior}} design, produced a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> of a sketch drawn earlier by Michael Simcoe, Holden's design {{director at the}} time.

2500|$|... 2D {{computer}} graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing {{technologies such as}} typography. In those applications, the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> {{is not just a}} representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than 3D {{computer graphics}}, whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography.|$|E

2500|$|Interestingly, affine {{invariance}} {{can be accomplished}} from measurements of the same multi-scale windowed second moment matrix [...] as {{is used in the}} multi-scale Harris operator provided that we extend the regular scale space concept obtained by convolution with rotationally symmetric Gaussian kernels to an affine Gaussian scale-space obtained by shape-adapted Gaussian kernels (Lindeberg 1994 section 15.3; Lindeberg and Garding 1997).

2500|$|In {{addition}} to being circularly symmetric, the Gaussian blur {{can be applied to}} a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> as two independent one-dimensional calculations, and so is termed separable filter. That is, the effect of applying the two-dimensional matrix can also be achieved by applying a series of single-dimensional Gaussian matrices in the horizontal direction, then repeating the process in the vertical direction. In computational terms, this is a useful property, since the calculation can be performed in [...] time (where h is height and w is width; see Big O notation), as opposed to [...] for a non-separable kernel.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, in {{southern}} Scandinavia, Niels A.

Later versions would have 254 scintillators so a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> could be produced on a color monitor. It allowed them to construct images reflecting brain activation from speaking, reading, visual or auditory perception and voluntary movement.

Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, polygonal mesh modeling (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh subdivision (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> through a process called 3D rendering, used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using 3D Printing devices.|$|E

The ridge descriptor in the image domain will then be a projection of this three-dimensional curve into the <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>image</b> plane, where the attribute scale information at every ridge point {{can be used as}} a natural estimate of the width of the ridge structure in the image domain in a neighbourhood of that point.|$|E
