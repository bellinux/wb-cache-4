500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2004, Robertson {{said that}} God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a [...] "blowout" [...] in November. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Bush {{is going to}} win in a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. [...] "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout {{election}} in 2004. It's shaping up that way." [...] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.|$|E
2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because I {{think that a lot}} of that is passed on from parent to child. I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to know that I had this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping into and out of stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|E
50|$|Later on Veronica visits Georges. They {{are having}} a {{conversation}} full of suspicious elements of both sides which made the whole situation absurd: they do not trust each other {{but in the same}} time they like each other. Veronica makes Georges frustrated and angry: she <b>thinks</b> <b>Georges</b> only a mean person who use everybody to his own benefit and then leaves his victims. This is not true, <b>thinks</b> <b>Georges,</b> he is just takink part in the political field. At the end of the scene Georges is getting ready for the party at Bounouminé and destroying his room because of his rage.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} is father's last idea?" [...] said Christie, with, I fear, a slight lack of reverence in her tone, as her sister reentered the room. [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>George</b> Kearney is paying you too much attention." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{think he}} absolutely, {{positively}} {{knew that he}} was rubbing grease on him. Do I <b>think</b> <b>Georges</b> was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all. But that corner man was rubbing grease on him." [...] -Dana White, post fight at UFC 94.|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY (hurriedly {{thinking}} things out). I know. I--I <b>think,</b> <b>George,</b> {{that before}} your mother comes I {{should like to}} say a word to father.|$|E
6000|$|... "What sort {{of thing}} do yer <b>think,</b> <b>George?</b> I can hold a hoss, but that aint much for a living. One may go for days without getting a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>George</b> {{will ever}} {{permit us to}} have colours,' said Ethel; 'he says that Rifles have no {{business}} with them, for that they are of no use to skirmishers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I cannot <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> would really, on the whole, {{prefer to}} take your place," [...] said Mr. Wilton, turning to George.|$|R
50|$|Upset, Judy {{insists that}} George use a wheelchair. But {{when she sees}} Dr. Morrissey and he tells her that George is fine, she <b>thinks</b> <b>George</b> is lying to wriggle out of the {{consequences}} of his affair. She rolls {{him out of the house}} and locks him out, announcing her intention to divorce him. George spends the night at Arnold's house, during which time George's various demands and idiosyncrasies cause Arnold to strike, one by one, many of the complimentary remarks about George he had planned on making in his eulogy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ethel," [...] cried her sister, raising {{herself from}} her couch eagerly, [...] "I {{will say it}} to you! What should you <b>think</b> of <b>George</b> resigning his seat, and living in peace here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not. If I had to farm it, I'd feel scared; and I don't <b>think</b> <b>George</b> is happy. It's hard to {{understand}} how Marston let it get into such a state." ...|$|E
6000|$|Or in {{a torrent}} of exasperation, [...] "I CARN'T <b>think,</b> <b>George,</b> why you don't get a bit of glass 'ere. This sunny corner you c'd do wonders {{with a bit of}} glass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> {{should never}} have made that journey," [...] she resumed. [...] "Fond of the open as he was, he hadn't the {{physical}} stamina. He never spared himself; he was apt to overestimate his powers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} Kramer notices Jerry's jacket {{hanging in the}} bathroom, badly damaged by the snow. Kramer takes it. [...] Elaine arrives and chides Jerry for not turning the jacket inside out. [...] She tells Jerry {{that her father had}} a good time. She {{explains}} how he usually hates everyone but liked Jerry, as he reminded him of a certain [...] "somebody" [...] from Korea; she then mentions that he <b>thinks</b> <b>George</b> is gay because [...] "he pretty much thinks everyone is gay." [...] Meanwhile, as Alton drives home, he finds himself singing [...] "Master of the House" [...] as well.|$|R
5000|$|... "Most people <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> Nelson, Charles Eames and Eliot Noyes invented {{industrial}} design. That is, of course, an exaggeration. George did {{it without}} any {{assistance from the}} other two."—Bill N. Lacy, FAIA ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'With delight,' he answered. 'I am used, you know, to walks before breakfast. George, I do not <b>think</b> <b>George</b> can do it, though. George {{likes his}} comforts; he {{is a regular}} John Bull. He was always calling for tea {{when we were in}} Turkey!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Lignum," [...] says Mrs. Bagnet, {{casting a}} glance on the table-cloth, and winking [...] "salt!" [...] at Malta {{with her right}} eye, and shaking the pepper away from Quebec with her head, [...] "I begin to <b>think</b> <b>George</b> is in the roving way again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! Much {{good that}} does now!" [...] Being got into bed, with the sheet {{smoothed}} under her chin, she said, with {{the effect of}} drawing a strictly logical conclusion from the premises, [...] "Well, I should <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Maynard {{would want to be}} with his family!" ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1964 Disney film Mary Poppins, the Banks family mistakenly <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> W. Banks has {{committed}} suicide by jumping {{off the bridge}} after he is fired from {{his job at the}} bank.|$|R
6000|$|... "Four, is it? I {{was told}} six--I <b>think</b> by <b>George</b> Bertram in former days. I should of course prefer six; {{but if it}} be only four, why we must {{make the best of}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{were the}} real facts about these swans we never found out. We {{questioned}} Harris {{on the subject}} in the morning, and he said, “What swans?” and seemed to <b>think</b> that <b>George</b> and I had been dreaming.|$|R
6000|$|He {{concluded}} as {{he often}} concluded these talks. [...] "I must invent something,--that's about what I must do. Zzzz. Some convenience. Something people want.... Strike out.... You can't <b>think,</b> <b>George,</b> of anything everybody wants and hasn't got? I mean something you could turn out retail under a shilling, say? Well, YOU think, whenever you haven't got anything better to do. See?" ...|$|E
60|$|That {{seemed to}} satisfy them all. They couldn't {{get away from}} it. It {{seemed to me that}} from now on the thing was a walk-over. And I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> felt the same, for, when old Marshall asked him if he had had breakfast, he said he had not, went below, and pitched in as if he hadn't a care in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon you <b>think</b> <b>George</b> and me are a funny kind of friends," [...] he said. [...] "The fact is {{we never}} did take much {{interest}} in each other's company. But his idea and mine, of what a friend should be, was always synonymous and we lived up to it, strict, all these years. Now, I'll {{give you an idea}} of what our idea is.|$|E
6000|$|Gratian {{shook her}} head. [...] "No, you thought {{my mind was}} yours; and now you <b>think</b> it's <b>George's.</b> But it's my own. When you were my age weren't you trying hard to find the truth yourself, and differing from your father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, I do not <b>think</b> Mr. <b>George</b> Rivers and I {{should be}} likely to get on together. What a bad style of wit! You heard what Mary said about him? and Ethel {{repeated}} the doubt between hating and detesting.|$|R
5000|$|While {{not wearing}} his glasses, <b>George</b> <b>thinks</b> he recognizes, from a distance, Jerry's girlfriend Amy (Anna Gunn) kissing Jerry's cousin Jeffrey, who {{apparently}} has a [...] "horse face". He tells this to Jerry, who then goes to Amy {{and tries to}} get her to confess her infidelity; she indignantly denies it. Jerry doesn't know what to <b>think</b> of <b>George's</b> uncanny ability to see fine details while [...] "squinting"; however after George mistakes an onion for an apple, Jerry wonders whether George was also mistaken about having seen Amy with Jeffrey.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe, Joseph, I {{have done}} all that is {{possible}} to-night," [...] the little woman finally said, as she fastened in place the last bandage. [...] "You are not {{to get up in}} the morning until after I have made certain you are in no danger of a fever. Now, go to your room, and if you <b>think</b> <b>George</b> may disturb you, I'll put him in the spare chamber." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>George</b> Boon did on {{the whole}} enjoy the {{remarkable}} setting of his philosophical detachment very keenly; the monstrous fame of him that rolled about the world, that set out east and came back circumferentially from the west and beat again upon his doors. He laughed irresponsibly, spent the resulting money with an intelligent generosity, and talked of other things. [...] "It {{is the quality of}} life," [...] he said, and [...] "The people love to have it so." ...|$|E
60|$|Harris said he didn’t <b>think</b> <b>George</b> {{ought to}} do {{anything}} that would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might be dangerous. He said he didn’t very well understand how George was going to sleep any more than he did now, seeing that there were only twenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; but thought that if he did sleep any more, he might just as well be dead, and so save his board and lodging.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two hundred dollars!" [...] {{repeated}} Rollo, with astonishment. [...] "What could uncle <b>George</b> <b>think</b> I {{could want}} {{of all this}} money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think what a {{sight of}} money that is!" [...] {{continued}} Pritchett. [...] "One would really <b>think,</b> Mr. <b>George,</b> that you objected to money. There is that gentleman, your particular friend, you know, the member of Parliament. He is down there constantly, paying his respects, as he calls it." ...|$|R
50|$|After George leaves, Brian and Dinah come back. Olivia {{tells them}} that she <b>thinks</b> <b>George</b> will be fine with their marriage, though George hasn't made much {{progress}} in accepting them. Olivia also reminds them that Lady Marden is coming for lunch, after which Mr. Pim returns. George returns to receive him. While talking to George and Olivia, Mr. Pim tells them {{that he had just}} returned from a trip to Australia, and while on his way back, he'd seen a man whom he presumed to be deceased. Mr. Pim tells them the man's name was Telworthy, which was the name of Olivia's first husband, who had also lived (and was presumed to have died) in Australia. Before George and Olivia can process this, Lady Marden is announced to have arrived by Anne.|$|R
