5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> navigation equipment.

5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta.

The charters did not address <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them.

5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and {{the lack}} of any {{suitable}} place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required a number of features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs as far away from enemy airspace as possible, while <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> border region to Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{locality}} <b>sensitive</b> k-means clustering {{method has}} been presented recently. Although this approach can improve the clustering accuracies, it often gains the unstable clustering results because some random samples are employed for the initial centers. In this paper, an initialization method based on the core clusters is used for <b>the</b> locality <b>sensitive</b> k-means clustering. <b>The</b> core clusters can be formed by constructing the σ-neighborhood graph and their centers are regarded as the initial centers of <b>the</b> locality <b>sensitive</b> k-means clustering. To investigate the effectiveness of our approach, several experiments are done on three datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the clustering performance compared to <b>the</b> previous locality <b>sensitive</b> k-means clustering...|$|R

Because of <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to <b>the</b> <b>sensitive</b> material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
