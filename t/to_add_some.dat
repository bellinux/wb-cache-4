5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, a professor at the Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had started}} an {{intensive}} rearmament near the Finnish border in 1938–1939. Finnish students and volunteers {{had spent the}} late summer 1939 improving the defensive structures across the Karelian Isthmus. On the Soviet side of the border, penal labour worked hard in order <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> density to sparse road and rail networks. In summer 1939 was an important phase of Soviet planning, told by Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Kirill Meretskov in their memoirs. The Supreme Council of War ordered the Commander of Leningrad Military District Merestkov to draft an invasion plan, instead of Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov. The plan was adopted in July. Necessary assault troop deployments and commands were not initiated until October 1939, though operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November. Stalin however was certain that the Finns would change their opinion under Soviet pressure and cede the demanded territories.|$|E

5|$|This {{particular}} disclosure {{has given}} rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary’s pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg’s disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime’s factional politics and show trials.|$|E
25|$|Another way of {{extending}} dependence logic is <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> generalized quantifiers {{to the language}} of dependence logic. Very recently there has been some study of dependence logic with monotone generalized quantifiers and dependence logic with a certain majority quantifier, the latter leading to a new descriptive complexity characterization of the counting hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|Top, or first, bass is {{the highest}} pitched drum in the bass line and usually starts or ends phrases. The high tension drum heads allow this player to play notes that are just as taxing {{as those of the}} snare line, and often the top bass will play a part in unison with the snare line <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> depth to their sound.|$|E
25|$|Jan-Willem Maessen, in 2002, and Simon Peyton Jones, in 2003, {{discussed}} {{problems associated}} with lazy evaluation while also acknowledging the theoretical motives for it, in addition to purely practical considerations such as improved performance. They note that, in addition <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> performance overhead, lazy evaluation {{makes it more difficult}} for programmers to reason about the performance of their code (particularly its space use).|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} designers {{argue that}} these trade-offs are important to Go's success, and explain some particular decisions at length, though they do express openness <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> form of generic programming in the future, and to pragmatic improvements in areas like standardizing ways to apply code generation. Regarding GC, Go defenders point to pause-time reduction in later versions (e.g. Go 1.6), while acknowledging their GC algorithm is not hard real-time.|$|R

25|$|Released in 1962, the Austin Freeway and Wolseley 24/80 {{models were}} Australian built {{variants}} of the Austin A60 Cambridge and Wolseley 15/60 respectively, both {{powered by a}} six-cylinder version of the BMC B-Series engine. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> Australasian brand confusion, in New Zealand the Austin Freeway was badged as a Morris Freeway and the Morris Mini Deluxe was badged as an Austin Se7en.

25|$|Wood ash or sawdust {{can also}} be added {{on top of the}} feces to {{decrease}} the smell. However, this is rarely done for pit latrines (more commonly done for dry toilets) as the users find that too much hassle and generally do not expect a pit latrine to be odour free and rather put up with some smell. In the case of Arborloos it is recommended <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> leaves, soil or compost into the pit after defecation.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum is {{essential}} to plant health. Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms. Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation, thus it may need <b>to</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> soils before seeding legumes.|$|R

2500|$|Looking for a {{follow-up}} single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote [...] "Surfin' Safari", and {{attempts were made}} to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of [...] "Surfer Girl". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting <b>to</b> <b>adding</b> <b>some</b> Chubby Checker songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.|$|R
25|$|Around {{that time}} the house was first modified. The Federal style was in ascendance, and {{builders}} were often asked to copy the similar Adamesque mode popular in Britain for the preceding half-century. Many existing buildings were altered <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> elements of those newer styles. One such change, the lunette windows, was common, and thus the windows on the second story of the house's south facade were duly altered. The change may {{have been inspired by}} the Union Hotel (no longer extant) in downtown Ossining, which had a similar row of lunettes.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> {{flexibility}} when deploying for attack, a new {{signal was}} provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, {{rather than as}} previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron {{was moved to the}} front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1810 John Crawfurd {{assumed the}} name Lindsay and {{claimed to be}} descended from the Hon. James Crawfurd, third son of the first Viscount Garnock. After much expense and {{deliberation}} the story {{was found to be}} entirely false and the claim rejected. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> credibility to the claim he had claimed that his forebear had been the eldest son and heir and had been forced to flee to Ireland after having murdered a man in a duel by firing before the signal. This duel he claimed had been over a matter of honour relating to the Lady Susanna Kennedy, later Countess of Eglinton, with whom he was entirely smitten.|$|E

25|$|When around forty manga {{chapters}} {{had been}} published, Arakawa {{said that as}} the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase {{the pace of the}} narrative. To avoid making some chapters less entertaining than others, unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed. The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in Monthly Shōnen Gangan to include all the story content she wanted <b>to</b> <b>add.</b> <b>Some</b> characters' appearances were limited in some chapters. At first, Arakawa thought the series would last twenty-one volumes but the length increased to twenty-seven. Serialization finished after nine years, and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because she had told everything she wanted with the manga.|$|E
25|$|The {{former head}} coach of the Belarus {{national}} team and the Washington Capitals, Glen Hanlon, followed Doug Shedden as the head coach for Jokerit {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. Although fresh from SM-liiga Playoffs, Jokerit announced several signings for the season. Jokerit contracted former Jokerit and Dallas Stars-player Juha Lind, former AHL'ers Janne Lahti along with Tomi Mäki and enforcer and fighter Pasi Nielikäinen. Former Jokerit and Frölunda HC defenseman Tom Koivisto was signed <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> offensive touch to the Jokerit defence and Antti Hulkkonen was signed for his experience. The goalkeeper Juuso Riksman returned to Jokerit after a one-year visit to North America and the AHL, replacing Jussi Markkanen who joined HC CSKA Moscow of the RSL.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} current {{westbound}} off ramp, existing ramps linking the bridge traffic to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island are inadequate to handle traffic for future expected residential development. In particular, the eastbound off ramp has always been extremely hazardous, while added westbound on ramp traffic would interfere with bridge traffic flow. Between the tunnel's western portal and the existing western suspension span, {{there is no room}} for modern ramp configurations. The developments are expected <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> three thousand residents to the island, as well as business and office space. To support this traffic, a system of new ramps (currently only partially completed) will be built on the eastern side of the islands to link to the YBITS, where there will be adequate room for proper traffic merges and departures. The east-side ramps are expected to cost about $95,670,000 while they began construction on late-2013 for a June 2016 opening. New westbound on- and off-ramps opened on October 22, 2016.|$|E

25|$|In January 1961, the CIA {{provided}} the ROC with {{its first two}} U-2Cs, and in April the squadron flew its first mission over mainland China. Other countries were occasionally overflown by the 35th Squadron, such as North Korea, North Vietnam and Laos; however, the main objective of the 35th Squadron was to conduct reconnaissance missions assessing the PRC's nuclear capabilities. For this purpose, the ROC pilots flew as far as Gansu and other remote regions in northwest China. Some missions, due to mission requirements and range, plus <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> element of surprise, had the 35th Squadron's U-2s flying from or recovered at other U.S. air bases in Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia, such as Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, or Takhli in Thailand. All U.S. airbases in the region were listed as emergency/alternate recovery airfields and could be used besides the 35th Squadron's home base at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan. Initially, all film taken by the Black Cat Squadron would be flown to Okinawa or Guam for processing and development, and the U.S. forces would not share any mission photos with ROC. In the late 1960s, the USAF agreed to share complete sets of mission photos and help set up a photo development and interpretation unit at Taoyuan.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{overseeing}} {{the transition to}} responsible government was left to the Administrator of the Government, Robert Wynyard, who opened the 1st New Zealand Parliament on 24 May 1854. Wynyard was quickly confronted by {{the demands of the}} new parliament that the parliament be able to appoint its own ministers, instead of the governor. The parliament passed a resolution to that effect on 2 June. Wynyard and the Executive Council of New Zealand refused to allow this, stating that the Colonial Office made no mention of responsible government in its dispatches. Wynyard then offered <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>some</b> elected members of parliament to the Executive Council, which he did—a compromise that worked for a few weeks, until on 1 August 1854, Parliament again demanded complete power to appoint ministers. Wynyard refused, and prorogued parliament for two weeks. Then on 31 August he appointed more elected members to the Executive Council, but when parliament met again on 8 August 1855, it moved a motion of no confidence in the members. Fortunately for Wynyard the next Governor, Sir Thomas Gore Browne, arrived on 6 September 1855. Gore Browne's tenure saw the introduction of responsible government, which greatly reduced the powers of the Governor. In the following years, Gore Browne and Premier Edward Stafford clashed over whether the Governor (and hence the imperial government) had control over Māori affairs, a key issue at the time. Stafford began the practice of Cabinet meeting independently of the Executive Council, further reducing the influence of the Governor. Sir George Grey returned to New Zealand in 1861 for a second term. Grey struggled to meet the competing demands of the Colonial and British governments. The New Zealand Wars had brought many British troops to New Zealand, and fearing further fighting Grey, with the support of Edward Stafford, evaded Colonial Office instructions to finalise their return to Britain. In the end the Colonial Office recalled Grey in February 1868.|$|E
