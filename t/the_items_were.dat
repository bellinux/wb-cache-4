5|$|Talking of {{the people}} who lived above the falls, Tuckey said that fowls, eggs, manioc and fruits were the {{property}} of women. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> never dealt with by the men without a discussion with their wives. Beads were given as presents from the men.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Lent's awards were {{auctioned}} at Sotheby's, London, on 18 July 1966. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder {{for the total}} sum of £500. The purchaser was Adolf Galland, the former Inspector of Fighters, {{acting on behalf of}} the West German Ministry of Defence. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter after consultation with her mother who was in urgent need for money to pay for an operation. The Ministry presented the collection to the Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 2013, {{suspicious}} luggage {{items were}} found inside the North bound train No. 616 toilet {{when it was}} heading towards THSR Hsinchu Station. The train was stopped at THSR Taoyuan Station {{and all of the}} passengers were evacuated. Later, it was determined the luggage contained an unidentified liquid in cans, alarm clock and white particulate matter. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> dismantled by the bomb squad and taken for further investigation. Two KMT legislators, Hsu Hsin-ying and Lu Shiow-yen, were on board.|$|E
5000|$|... "Each {{individual}} says {{how much}} he values <b>the</b> <b>item.</b> <b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> given to <b>the</b> individual that said the highest value. In case of a tie, <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> given to Alice". This mechanism is NOT BNIC, since a player who wants <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> better-off by saying the highest possible value, regardless of his true value.|$|R
5000|$|... "Each {{individual}} says {{a number}} between 1 and 10. <b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> given to <b>the</b> individual {{that said the}} lowest number; if both say the same number, then <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> given to Alice". This mechanism does NOT implement the utilitarian function, since for every individual that wants <b>the</b> <b>item,</b> it <b>is</b> a dominant strategy to say [...] "1" [...] regardless of his/her true value. This means that in equilibrium <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> always given to Alice, even if Bob values it more.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decoding}} step proceeds column-wise (i.e. by item). If every test {{in which}} an <b>item</b> appears <b>is</b> positive, then <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> declared defective; otherwise <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be non-defective. Or equivalently, if an item appears in any test whose outcome <b>is</b> negative, <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> declared non-defective; otherwise <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be defective. Of particular note {{here is that this}} algorithm never creates false negatives, though a false positive occurs when all locations with ones in the j-th column of [...] (corresponding to a non-defective <b>item</b> j) <b>are</b> “hidden” by the ones of other columns corresponding to defective items.|$|R
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>was</b> either {{imported}} {{prior to}} 1982 or after 1982 through on of the 13 ports specifically designated for antiques. Or <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>was</b> manufactured in <b>the</b> United States from legally imported ivory.|$|R
40|$|Content <b>items</b> <b>are</b> {{revealed}} to a user {{based on whether}} they have been previously reviewed by the user. A number of content <b>items</b> <b>are</b> thus received over time. <b>The</b> content <b>items</b> may <b>be</b> discrete content <b>items,</b> or may <b>be</b> portions of a content stream, and may be received over different media. For each content <b>item,</b> it <b>is</b> determined whether <b>the</b> content <b>item</b> <b>was</b> previously reviewed by a user.

5|$|The only area {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
25|$|The WJC {{also criticized}} the US {{internet}} retailer Amazon.com for selling ‘I love Hitler’ T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> later {{removed from the}} website.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Gary Lightbody and Nathan Connolly donated plectrums and {{certificates}} to the Music Beats Mines {{project that}} aims to clear unexploded mines/landmines from conflict zones. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> auctioned on eBay.|$|E
30|$|In itemset extension, <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} <b>the</b> last itemset in the {{sequence}} so that <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> greater than all <b>items</b> in <b>the</b> last itemset. So {{the size of the}} itemset-extended sequence does not change.|$|R
50|$|Relative: <b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} <b>the</b> normal flow, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow <b>items</b> <b>are</b> laid {{out as if}} <b>the</b> <b>item</b> had not <b>been</b> moved.|$|R
50|$|In outward clearing, <b>the</b> {{deposited}} <b>items</b> <b>are</b> scanned and <b>the</b> operator performs amount entry, account entry, item verification, balancing and bundling of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> at <b>the</b> branch level. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> {{then sent}} to a service branch.|$|R
25|$|Toronto Police Service held press {{conferences}} {{to speak out}} against inappropriate actions of protesters, including displaying items alleged to have been seized from protesters. However, when confronted, Chief Blair admitted that some of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> unrelated to the G20 protests.|$|E
25|$|Fearing {{the spread}} of mold, workers {{completed}} these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. Card catalogs and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early presses, photocopying, or copying by hand.|$|E
25|$|The leather loincloth {{and hide}} coat {{were made from}} sheepskin. Genetic {{analysis}} showed that the sheep species was nearer to modern domestic European sheep than to wild sheep; <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> made from the skins of at least four animals. Part of the coat was made from domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial haplogroup (a common female ancestor) that inhabits central Europe today.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> indivisible, an EF {{assignment}} may not exist. The simplest case is {{when there}} <b>is</b> a single <b>item</b> {{and at least}} two agents: if <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> assigned to one agent, the other will envy. Therefore, the division procedures provide various kinds of relaxations.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> then rinsed with {{distilled}} water.|$|R

25|$|What had {{happened}} to the Jews from the ghetto became known when on March 16 and 17, several vans returned to the ghetto carrying the personal property of the people who had been murdered. The clothing bore mudstains and signs of having been hastily removed. For example, stockings were still attached to garters. A detail was assigned to sort and clean these items, many of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> recognized by name tags and other indicia of ownership.|$|E
25|$|The {{excavation}} {{works that}} {{took place during the}} Crossrail project gave archaeologists an unique opportunity to explore the earth underneath London's streets that was previously seen as inaccessible. Crossrail underwent what was described {{as one of the most}} extensive archeological programmes ever seen in the UK. Over 100 archaeologists have found tens of thousands of items from 40 sites, spanning 55 million years of London’s history. Many of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> placed on show at the Museum of London Docklands from February to September 2017.|$|E
25|$|In 1879–80 the {{collections}} of the British East India Company's India Museum {{were given to the}} V and the British Museum. Most of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> plundered during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by the British forces and taken from India. Some of the examples are 'Tipu's Tiger', an automaton and mechanical organ made in Mysore around 1795. It represents a tiger mauling a soldier or officer of the British East India Company. It is named after the ruler of Mysore who commissioned it, Tipu Sultan.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} is also host to various student pranks. For example, {{on at least}} two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> put in place remains a mystery. The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day. The clock tower also plays music.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, much of Margaret's {{estate was}} {{auctioned}} by Christie's to meet inheritance tax, {{though some of}} <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> sold in aid of charities such as the Stroke Association. A world record price of £1.24million was set by a Fabergé clock. The Poltimore tiara, which she wore for her wedding in 1960, sold for £926,400. The sale of her effects totalled £13,658,000. In April 2007, an exhibition titled Princess Line – The Fashion Legacy of Princess Margaret opened at Kensington Palace, showcasing contemporary fashion from British designers such as Vivienne Westwood inspired by Princess Margaret's legacy of style. Christopher Bailey's Spring 2006 collection for Burberry was inspired by Margaret's look from the 1960s.|$|E

For most of the strip's run, Trudeau has eschewed merchandising, but starting in 1998 he teamed up with Starbucks to create Doonesbury products {{to raise funds for}} local literacy programs. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>were</b> offered for sale in Starbucks stores for nearly two years and raised over $1 million.
