500|$|The {{discovery}} was no serendipitous accident. Marley {{was asked by}} his employer, John Vaughan, co-founder of the company Bolckow Vaughan to study the geology of Cleveland, to help him locate a profitably <b>thick</b> <b>seam</b> of ironstone, conveniently close to Middlesbrough. Bolckow Vaughan had already in 1848 [...] "collected and shipped to Middlesbrough several thousand tons found on the coast between Redcar and Skinningrove"; Vaughan guessed that the same thick seams including the main bed might be found inland, in the Eston and Upleatham hills near the railway.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century a [...] <b>thick</b> <b>seam</b> of {{bituminous}} coal referred to historically as [...] "The Big Vein" [...] {{was discovered in}} the Georges Creek Valley.

2500|$|The {{geologist}} Joseph Jukes made {{it clear}} in 1858 that he felt {{the meaning of the}} term was self-explanatory to contemporary visitors, remarking that [...] "It is commonly known in the neighbourhood as the 'Black Country', an epithet the appropriateness of which must be acknowledged by anyone who even passes through it on a railway". Jukes based his Black Country on the seat of the great iron manufacture, which for him was geographically determined by the ironstone tract of the coalfield rather than the <b>thick</b> <b>seam,</b> running from Wolverhampton to Bloxwich, to West Bromwich, to Stourbridge and back to Wolverhampton again. A travelogue published in 1860 made the connection more explicit, calling the name [...] "eminently descriptive, for blackness everywhere prevails; the ground is black, the atmosphere is black, and the underground is honeycombed by mining galleries stretching in utter blackness for many a league". An alternative theory for the meaning of the name is proposed as having been caused by the darkening of the local soil due to the outcropping coal and the seam near the surface.|$|E
30|$|Selection of a {{suitable}} mining method for extraction of a <b>thick</b> coal <b>seam</b> with optimal recovery and safety {{is an extremely}} delicate process. In fact, single lift working of full thickness of a <b>thick</b> coal <b>seam</b> has always a verge over the multi-slice working due to favorable economics and high production and productivity. Blasting Gallery (BG) method is suitable for extraction of virgin <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> as well as developed pillars in <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> in single lift. The method was very successful resulting in 85 % of extraction with high productivity. But, this method experienced strata control problems during final extraction. The presence of strong and massive overlying roof strata caused high values of the mining induced stress over the pillars facing the goaf line during the depillaring. High values of mining-induced stresses in and around a depillaring face of <b>thick</b> coal <b>seam</b> generally create a threat of pillar overriding.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoal {{production}} in China accounts for 1 / 3 of total output in the world, and {{nearly half of}} China’s output is extracted in <b>thick</b> coal <b>seams.</b> Therefore, it is significant to study fully mechanized mining technology in <b>thick</b> coal <b>seams.</b> The development, current situation, and issue of slicing mining, top-coal caving, and coal seams cutting sufficient height with fully mechanized mining technology are systematically analyzed in this paper.

30|$|About 3000 {{million tonnes}} of coal is {{locked up in}} {{standing}} pillars (Dixit and Mishra 2010) under varying geo-mining conditions, which is prime target of the mining industry {{to meet the demand}} of coal production. Present pillar extraction (depillaring) practices of the country have, predominantly, adopted intermediate mechanisation along with few fully mechanised depillaring faces. Most of these faces are operating at shallow cover. But the existing technoeconomical conditions of the industry are attracting a fully mechanised depillaring system for deep seated coal pillars, which is likely to grow in near future (Singh et al. 2011 a). In Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), about 60 % of coal is locked up in standing pillars formed by Bord and Pillar method (Internal Reports on BG method in the SCCL). About 50 % of coal reserves in India are in <b>seams</b> <b>thicker</b> than 4.5  m, which come under the category of <b>thick</b> <b>seams,</b> the exploitation of which is consistently posing challenges to the mining engineers. Extraction of <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> by conventional hand section method is neither productive nor effective from the conservation point of view (heavy loss of coal by conventional hand-section method). The percentage of extraction by hand section mining in <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> is as low as 25 – 30 %.|$|R
2500|$|Counter-mining {{activity}} by the Tunnelling Companies RE began at St Eloi {{in the spring}} of 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The Ypres area has a shallow soil layer of loam or sand above waterlogged semi-liquid sand and patches of sand and clay called slurry. Beneath the second layer is a <b>thick</b> <b>seam</b> of blue clay. The early mining took place above the blue clay which put very heavy pressures of water and wet sand on the underground works. In August the digging of galleries had begun to be ready by the end of June 1916. Both sides spent 1915 mining and counter-mining, the British springing [...] and [...] against [...] mines and [...] In September, Brigadier-General George Fowke the Engineer in Chief, proposed a mining offensive in the blue clay [...] underground. Since the Germans were on the higher ground, galleries could be driven horizontally into the blue clay from shafts about [...] back from the front line. By January 1916, the 172nd Tunnelling Company had sunk shafts into the blue clay and began to dig galleries [...] under the German front position. After the Second Army offensive in the summer of 1916 was postponed the mining offensive was made even more ambitious, with a plan to mine Messines Ridge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{industry}} in the Black Country is connected directly to its underlying geology. Much of the region lies upon an exposed coalfield forming {{the southern part of}} the South Staffordshire Coalfield where mining has taken place since the Middle Ages. There are, in fact several coal seams, some of which were given names by the miners. The top, thin coal seam is known as Broach Coal. Beneath this lies successively the Thick Coal, Heathen Coal, Stinking Coal, Bottom Coal and Singing Coal seams. Other seams also exist. The Thick Coal seam was also known as the [...] "Thirty Foot" [...] or [...] "Ten Yard" [...] seam and is made up of a number of beds that have come together to form one <b>thick</b> <b>seam.</b> Interspersed with the coal seams are deposits of iron ore and fireclay. The Black Country coal field is bounded on the north by the Bentley Fault, to the north of which lies the Cannock Chase Coalfield. [...] Around the exposed coalfield, separated by geological faults, lies a concealed coalfield where the coal lies at much greater depth. A mine was sunk between 1870 and 1874 over the eastern boundary of the then known coal field in Smethwick and coal was discovered at a depth of over 400 yards. In the last decade of the 19th century, coal was discovered beyond the western boundary fault at Baggeridge at a depth of around 600 yards.|$|E

The pit opened up a very <b>thick</b> <b>seam</b> of the whitest and most beautiful marble. I know another like it in Natal. But by whom it had been worked I cannot say; not by natives, that is certain, though the builders of these kraals had condescended to borrow the shape of native huts for their model. By the way, the only relic of those builders that I ever saw was a highly finished bronze pick-axe which Stella had found one day in the quarry.|$|E

50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively <b>thick</b> side <b>seam.</b> The <b>thick</b> side <b>seam</b> required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} achieve higher {{percentage}} of extraction (70 – 85 %) and to overcome {{the problems in the}} extraction of <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> by conventional bord and pillar method, the Charbonnage de France (CdF) suggested the Blasting Gallery (BG) method for extraction of virgin <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> as well as developed pillars in <b>thick</b> <b>seams</b> in India. It is a variant of the bord and pillar method of mining. Safe and efficient underground extraction of coal pillars under competent roof strata needs information about amount and nature of the mining induced vertical stress over pillars in and around the Blasting Gallery (BG) panel workings. However, the performance of these workings is highly dependent upon two types of stresses; mining induced stresses (Singh et al. 1996) and in situ stress (Sheorey 1994). For a given site, the in situ stress is more or less static in nature but the mining induced stresses over pillars/stooks keeps changing and is highly influenced by the strata equilibrium dynamics during different stages of the underground coal mining activity. Accidents due to movement of strata in underground coal mines had been a major concern for the mining industry and it is largest contributing factor of underground coal mine accidents. Continuous efforts were being made by all concerned to reduce the hazard of strata movement. The condition of strata and the stress environment around any working place is always dynamic in nature. No two working places are having identical strata condition. It is therefore essential to assess the roof condition of the underground working places at regular intervals by engineering methods. State-of-art of monitoring system through instrumented rock bolts, tell-tales, multiple point borehole extensometers, convergence indicators, load cells etc. are available for continuous monitoring the strata movement.|$|R
