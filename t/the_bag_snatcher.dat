40|$|Mineral {{processing}} {{plants in the}} United States and throughout the world process material that is finely ground and placed into bags for shipping to <b>the</b> consumer. These <b>bags</b> normally range from 50 to 100 pounds in weight. Once the material is placed in these bags, a <b>bag</b> stacker loads <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> onto pallets. A bag stacker is exposed {{to a lot of}} dust that is mainly released by the force from loading <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> onto <b>the</b> pallet. The two main sources are the dust on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> and <b>the</b> dust that escapes from inside <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> as it is loaded. The Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) records indicate <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's dust exposure is one of the highest of all workers at mineral processing operations. Ways to reduce the dust exposure and strain to <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker are in constant development. Recently, automated systems have been built. These systems range from fully automated, which totally remove the worker from the bag-stacking process, to semi-automated systems, in which <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker still performs some of the functions. This Hazard Control deals with controlling <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's dust exposure during use of a semi-automated palletizing machine. The worker slides <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> into position on the palletizing machine. Once an entire layer of <b>bags</b> is positioned, <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker operates <b>the</b> controls on the palletizing machine to lower <b>the</b> layer of <b>bags</b> onto <b>the</b> pallet. An air slide is built into the semi-automated palletizing machine so <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> are easier to move. This slide uses a metal table with air jets that exit through small holes at high velocities, similar to an air hockey game. The dust problem occurs because the air slide causes dust to blow up onto <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker, significantly increasing the dust exposure. NIOSH researchers became aware of this problem while working at a mineral processing operation that was having problems with a bag stacker who was overexposed to dust. The air slide on the semi-automated palletizing unit was determined to be the main cause for the high dust concentrations. The impact of the air slide on <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's dust exposure was found by using real-time dust monitors. Figure 1 shows <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's average respirable dust exposure while working with product bags of three different mesh sizes when the air slide was either on or off. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's respirable dust exposure was 5 to 11 times higher when the air slide was on compared with when it was off. This mineral processing operation used an exhaust ventilation system with an exhaust hood {{at the back of the}} palletizing unit. The exhaust ventilation system was not powerful enough to immediately capture the dust blown up from the air slide. An overhead air supply island system (OASIS) was also used to provide an envelope of clean air over <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker. <b>The</b> OASIS at this operation brings in outside air through two different filter stages and directs the clean air down over <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker. This envelope of clean air was not powerful enough to overcome the dust that was being blown up into <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's breathing zone from the air slide. The key to lowering <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable concentrations was to make a few simple changes and to slightly modify <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's work habits. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> stacker had been leaning out over the air slide table and placing his upper torso in the front part of the exhaust ventilation system capture hood. Therefore, NIOSH researchers suggested that the exhaust hood be modified to make it physically impossible for <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker to place his or her upper torso into the hood (Figure 2). The next modification involved installing plastic stripping around the perimeter of the OASIS. The plastic stripping gave <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker a physical indication of the clean air boundary provided by the OASIS. Testing was repeated after the changes were made to the semi-automated palletizing system. This time, the testing showed that the changes to the system had minimized the impact of air slide contamination to <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker. Once again, three product sizes of mesh bags were evaluated. No increase was found in <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's dust exposure with two of the products, and only a very slight increase was found with the other product. The changes made to <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> palletizing process accounted for the reductions of <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's respirable dust exposure to MSHA-acceptable dust concentrations. NIOSH researchers believe that all operators using this type of semi-automated palletizing system need to be aware of the serious dust contamination that can occur to <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker from <b>the</b> air slide. To control high dust exposures from air slides on semi-automated palletizing units (Figure 3), make the following modifications: 1. Use an exhaust ventilation system with an effective hood design to capture the dust generated during <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacking process. 2. Use an OASIS to provide an envelope of clean air over <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker. 3. Place plastic stripping around the OASIS to provide a boundary of the clean air from the system. 4. Modify <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> stacker's work practices to have the worker stay within the envelope of clean air provided by the OASIS. NIOSH No. 2002160...|$|R
