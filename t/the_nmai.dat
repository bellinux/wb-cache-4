40|$|The museum world, which seldom consults Native {{communities}} {{about the}} proper care and disposition of their cultural legacy, did not always appreciate <b>the</b> <b>NMAIs</b> new approaches to handling the collection. Furthermore, many of the leading museums in the United States and the world continue to exhibit American-Indian and other indigenous peoples alongside dinosaur and mastodon exhibits. Indian people often joke ironically about the perceptions of Natives as ancient peoples who have vanished {{from the face of}} the Earth. This new understanding of curation includes a policy of restoring remains and burial goods of human ancestors as quickly as possible to the appropriate tribal communities...|$|R

50|$|In 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{completed}} {{a study of}} the extent to which the Smithsonian had fulfilled the repatriation requirements of <b>the</b> <b>NMAI</b> Act. The GAO found that while the Smithsonian had inventoried, identified, and returned thousands of Indian human remains, at the current pace it may take decades more for it to complete the process. The GAO suggested that Congress consider ways to expedite the process including, but not limited to, directing the Smithsonian to make cultural affiliation determinations as efficiently and effectively as possible. The GAO also recommended certain administrative changes to enhance oversight of the process.|$|E
