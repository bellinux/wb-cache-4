5|$|Critics commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{seemed to}} be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience.

In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, which she has performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E
5|$|Crossing the Water {{is full of}} {{perfectly}} realised works. Its most striking impression is of a front-rank artist {{in the process of}} discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{significant}} event {{related to}} Bodley was the {{agreement between the}} Bodleian Library and the Stationer's Company, in which [...] "the Company agreed to send to the Library a copy of every book entered in their Register on condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> thus given might be borrowed if needed for reprinting, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> given to <b>the</b> Library by others might be examined, collated and copied by the Company." ...|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations.

5|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was well {{researched}} and provided a solid history of the show.

5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood.

5|$|Ultra Violet, {{according}} to her somewhat unreliable report, interviewed her. Solanas was then known as Onz Loh.

[...] Amorth believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>books</b> can be a bad influence on children by getting them interested in the occult.|$|R
5|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Bill Williams stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{should be}} {{mandatory}} reading {{for high school}} and college students. Anne Phillips wrote in her review for The News-Gazette <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> is a concise and well-written description of the conflicts the country faces when grappling with the notions of freedom of expression, free speech, and freedom of the press. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Chuck Leddy noted that the author helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech in a democracy, especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, {{he was one}} {{of those}} {{politicians}} who forced Prime Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Jan Jacob Rochussen, his former Governor-General, to resign his post, in part because a corruption scandal in the East Indies came to light.

5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{schoolchildren}} from Canton, Massachusetts decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{was worthy}} of being the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book.|$|E

Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was still a useful reference work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
