The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources {{and at one point}} faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of Victor Conte's lawyers, pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend {{two and a half years}} in jail.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. The {{holes in the}} ship's hull had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E
5|$|Hickok willed her {{personal}} papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, {{part of the}} US National Archives. Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and was astounded to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where they are available to the public.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Manning {{left the}} family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no {{evidence}} that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed,</b> along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{regional}} {{fault seal}} analysis tudy of SE Asian basins {{was carried out}} in order to define trends for predicting sealing faults. Map and well data were analysed and relationships were obtained between fault and reservoir parameters and fault seal. The parameters found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> most useful for discriminating between sealing and non-sealing faults in the region were fault strike, fault mode (oblique slip faults <b>are</b> most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealing),</b> fault throw (faults with high throws <b>are</b> most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealing),</b> depth (shallow faults <b>are</b> most likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealing)</b> and thickness-throw. Other parameters measured, some of which are useful for fault seal prediction i some basins, are: fault type (bounding faults, within-field faults, across-field faults), net-to-gross ratio, average reservoir po osity, average reservoir permeability, differences i hydrocarbon contact elevation across faults, hydrocarbon column height held back by sealing faults, and reservoir pressure and temperature. Data from over 150 faults from fields within West Java <b>are</b> presented <b>to</b> illustrate the main results of the analysis.

25|$|Although Abel {{remained}} a faithful {{member of the}} church his entire life, he was not exempt from discrimination that existed in his church and state. His membership, participation, and leadership in the church was frequently questioned and challenged. After moving to Utah, Abel asked Brigham Young for permission <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> {{to his wife and}} children, which was denied. Abel requested a sealing again five years later, this time to President John Taylor. His request was again denied, and he was also not allowed to enter the temple to be endowed.|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} Nan Commandery, LÃ¼ Meng {{treated the}} civilian population well, among whom included family members of Guan Yu's troops. He also gave strict orders to his men, forbidding them from disturbing the people. In one incident, LÃ¼ Meng executed one of his soldiers for stealing from a civilian household, even though that soldier was an old acquaintance of his. He shed tears after that. This incident shocked the other soldiers in LÃ¼ Meng's unit {{and they did not}} dare to defy his orders. LÃ¼ Meng won the hearts of the people by showing kindness towards them â€“ he provided necessities such as food and clothing to the elderly and the poor, and distributed medicine to the sick. He also ordered the treasury in the commandery office <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> up while they awaited Sun Quan's arrival.|$|E
25|$|The {{tarantula}} hawkâ€™s namesake {{comes from}} its predation of tarantulas {{to raise their}} young. After mating, the female wasp will seek out a tarantula, either free ranging or in its burrow. After grappling with the tarantula, the wasp will deliver a powerful sting that essentially paralyzes the tarantula permanently, but keeps it alive. This allows the wasp to lay an egg that adheres to the spiderâ€™s abdomen. One tarantula is provisioned per egg. The egg is about 5 millimeters long, gently curved, and creamy white in color. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed tarantula along with the egg, sometimes up to 100 meters, to a cavity or burrow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed.</b> This dugout can be either dug by the wasp or be the burrow of the paralyzed spider. When the larva hatches, it will feed on the spiderâ€™s guts to completion, keeping the spider alive {{for as long as}} possible for freshness.|$|E

25|$|Elijah Abel (July 25, 1808 â€“ December 25, 1884) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} African-American members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was the first African-American elder and seventy in the Latter Day Saint movement. Abel was also the first {{and one of the few}} black members in the early history of the church to receive the priesthood. In 1849, Brigham Young declared all African-Americans ineligible to hold the priesthood and Abel's claim to priesthood right was also challenged. As a skilled carpenter, Abel often offered his services to the furthering of the work and to the building of LDS temples. On multiple occasions, Abel requested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to his wife, and each time this request was denied. In 1879 a meeting was held in Abraham Smoot's house to discuss the priesthood problem in general, and was revisited again two months later where Abel defended his priesthood ordination. To this day it is unclear whether Abel was even a formally proclaimed priesthood holder, and if so when such a right was instituted.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the {{underground}} facility began in late 1941, and was completed by late summer 1942. The chambers served as a dual observation post, with an observation slit overlooking the Bay of Gibraltar and a larger aperture over the Mediterranean Sea. Six men were selected for the operation, an executive officer as leader, two physicians, and three wireless operators. All six men had volunteered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> inside the cave should Gibraltar fall to the Axis powers. The men understood that they would remain sealed within the facility for about a year, although it could be much longer. Provisions for a seven-year stay had been assembled in the complex. However, the plan was never activated. The Director of Naval Intelligence ordered that the provisions in the complex be distributed and the cave sealed. Rumours of a secret complex, eventually dubbed Stay Behind Cave, circulated for decades in Gibraltar, until discovery of the chambers in 1997 by the Gibraltar Caving Group. The authenticity of the site was confirmed {{by one of the}} builders in 1998, and a decade later by one of the physicians. That physician, the last surviving member of the Tracer team, died in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
