5|$|Traffic was {{originally}} {{going to be}} distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into <b>turnaround</b> unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in Traffic, Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio took it out of <b>turnaround.</b> Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio {{by the time the}} first draft was finished. It went back into <b>turnaround.</b> Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.|$|E

5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour <b>turnarounds</b> common for container ships, 15-hour <b>turnarounds</b> for car carriers, and 26-hour <b>turnarounds</b> for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech's <b>turnaround</b> from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season <b>turnaround</b> in school history and was the second-best {{in the country that}} year. Tech hoped to improve upon a 14 all-time record in bowl games, while Indiana hoped to do {{likewise}} for its 34 historical bowl-game record. In the week prior to the game, bad weather in Virginia caused travel delays that prevented many fans and the Virginia Tech marching band from arriving at the game early. Two days prior to the Independence Bowl, Tech was shocked by the death of Dr. Richard Bullock, who served as the team's physician from 1971 to 1988. Bullock designed a special football neck protector worn by players during the 1980s and 1990s before being phased out in favor of more advanced padding.|$|E

In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education.

40|$|For many years, {{business}} <b>turnarounds</b> {{have captured}} the attention of scholars and fascinated executives. Yet despite their centrality as a business phenomenon, {{little is known about the}} prevalence or trajectory of <b>turnarounds.</b> This paper provides evidence on a broad cross-section of publicly traded companies to fill the gap. The results indicate that since 1987 the financial-market premium on businesses with very low performance has been higher than the premium on companies with moderately low performance. Since 1993 the premium escalated dramatically, consistent with the idea that investors became increasingly enthusiastic about the prospect of <b>turnarounds.</b> The evidence suggests that this enthusiasm may be unfounded: During the 1980 s and 1990 s, businesses that experienced an episode of profitability in the lowest quintile of the economy rarely both retained their organizational stability and rebounded to achieve performance in the top quintile. In particular, very low performers that reported financial results as stable entities for 5 years were 3. 4 times as likely to sustain their very low performance as to become very high performers. Similarly, only 3 % of businesses that posted very high performance after having survived a 5 -year period had been very low performers at the beginning of the period. The paper also identifies several of the exceptional businesses that remained independent, survived, and accomplished <b>turnarounds</b> during the 1980 s and 1990 s, and shows that the financial markets were not effective at identifying their impending <b>turnarounds</b> ex ante.
