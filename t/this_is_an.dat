Censuses before this cannot be compared, as the ward boundaries (and therefore population) changed after the 1991 census.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> example of a halogen addition reaction.|$|E

5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E

5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E

5|$|In prokaryotes the cytosol {{contains}} the cell's genome, within a structure {{known as a}} nucleoid. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> irregular mass of DNA and associated proteins that control the transcription and replication of the bacterial chromosome and plasmids. In eukaryotes the genome is held within the cell nucleus, which is separated from the cytosol by nuclear pores that block the free diffusion of any molecule larger than about 10nanometres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin.
