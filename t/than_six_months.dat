5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through {{the first six months}} is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present for more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> and cause problems {{in at least two}} settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E

5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
50|$|The International Association for {{the study}} of pain defines chronic pain as pain with no {{biological}} value, that persists past normal tissue healing.

5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mor-tality in women worldwide, in part due to a greater than 65 percent incidence of intraperitoneal disease persist-ence, or less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> disease recurrence after platinum chemotherapy [1]. Chemotherapeutic strategies to overcome ovarian cancer resistance to platinum chemotherapy have included co-administration of pacli-taxel or docetaxel, but whether other therapeutics may restore platinum cytotoxicity in “platinum-resistant ” can-cer remains uncertain [2 - 4]. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitors such as hydroxyurea, gemcitabine, and 3 -aminopyridine- 2 -carboxyaldehyde-thiosemicarbazone (3 -AP) have gained new-found importance as anticancer agents in manage-ment of ovarian and cervical cancers [5 - 9].

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less <b>than</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
