50|$|Although {{the chosen}} title would suggest {{a work of}} natural philosophy, De Corpore is largely devoted to {{foundational}} matters. It consists of four sections. Part I covers logic. Part II and Part III concern “abstract bodies”: the second part is a repertoire of scientific concepts, and the third of geometry. The Chapters 16 to 20 of Part III are in fact devoted to mathematics generally, in a reductive way, and proved controversial. They proposed a kinematic foundation for geometry, which Hobbes wished <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> mathematics; geometry itself, that is, is a “science of motion”. Hobbes here adopts ideas from Galileo and Cavalieri. It is in Part IV, on natural phenomena, that there is discussion of physics as such.|$|E

He wrote directions for his officials which clearly show what form of regime he wanted to introduce. It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on public money. It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax-payers were at premium. It was their convenience for which the State was to function. It was a welfare-state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule, a regime where the rich cannot get richer while the poor are made poorer; a regime where canons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler. He asked people not to speak with him as they spoke with cruel governors and be honest with him.|$|E

Conan Doyle wrote of him in an article [...] "Early Psychic Experiences", published in Pearson's Magazine, March,1924. It's reproduced in part in occult historian Ellic Howe's book on The Golden Dawn.from Conan Doyle:"There was a small doctor dwelling near me, small in stature, and also I fear, in practice. Pullen Bury sic was the name. He was {{a student of the}} occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learning that he had one room in his house which no one entered but himself, as it was reserved for mystic and philosophic purposes."Ellic Howe continues the story, [...] "Pullen Burry suggested that Conan Doyle should join the G.D., but did not reveal its name. Conan Doyle described an unusual dream which he appeared <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> an 'astral visit' made by some member of the order to discover {{whether or not he was}} a suitable candidate. He decided not to ask for admission." [...] Another occult historian, R.A. Gilbert, mentions Conan Doyle's meetings with Pullen Burry occurred in 1898. Gilbert further quotes Conan Doyle as saying he in fact found his apparent astral examination [...] "queer and disagreeable". A month or two later, Pullen Burry brought G.D. member Dr. Felkin (see Robert Felkin) to see him. The Doyle article records his two visitors' extraordinary conversation about an 'astral journey' they had made together to Central Africa."from Conan Doyle's article: [...] "To return to the little doctor, he went out to the Klondyke sic and I lost sight of him for a long time. From what I learnt, I should judge that the powers of this society included that of loosening their own etheric bodies [...] "etheric body", in summoning the etheric bodies of others (mine for example), and in making thought images ... But their line of development or philosophy is beyond me. I was destined to meet Pullen Burry again, for when I was in America last year I found him full of Rosicrucian lore and occult knowledge." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Posterior {{reversible}} encephalopathy {{syndrome is}} characterized by headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures and visual disturbances. It has certain characteristic radiological features, which allow diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting and enable appropriate clinical therapy to be instituted. Case presentation A 10 -year-old Caucasian girl who was hospitalized due to recurrent vomiting was diagnosed as having posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after an initial diagnosis of cyclical vomiting and hypertension was made. Conclusion Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a rare disorder in children. Early recognition of characteristic radiological features {{is key to the}} diagnosis as clinical symptoms may be non-specific or mimic other neurological illnesses. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first case to report an association between posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, cyclical vomiting and hypertension. Furthermore, in this case, the resolution of the abnormalities found on magnetic resonance imaging over time did not appear <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> clinical recovery. </p...|$|E

In order to maximize their utilization of ripe fruit resources, which are generally described as patchy and variable in size (e. g., Ghiglieri, 1984), chimpanzee subgroups or parties fluctuate in size and individual make-up in response to resources.

The willingness of phy-sicians to engage in providing prevention counseling is influenced by many factors, especially, their training [2], their own personal habits and their self-confidence in doing so effectively [3, 4]. This “personal-clinical relation-ship ” has been well validated among Canadian and US physicians [4, 5] and is especially relevant in the area of tobacco control, as non-smoking physicians are more likely to report encouraging cessation among their pa-tients than those who smoke [4]. A similar trend is found among medical students, where healthy personal practices are found <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> engagement in preventive coun-seling and appreciation of importance of this role as part of their professional responsibility [6].

40|$|The Upper Cretaceous Kometan and Shiranish {{formations}} of the Kurdistan region, NE Iraq, yield diverse planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, with a {{total of}} 93 species, which enable recognition of nine biozones and two subzones spanning the early Turonian to late early Maastrichtian. Sequential changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages map discrete intervals within the Kometan and Shiranish formations that suggest dominantly warm, nutrient-poor marine surface and near-surface conditions during the mid-Turonian to late Coniacian, latest Santonian, and late Campanian, and cooler more nutrient-rich surface and near-surface waters in the early Turonian, early to late Santonian, early Campanian and early Maastrichtian. These intervals appear to correlate with changes in water masses from other regions of the Cretaceous palaeotropics, and with a phase of global, early Maastrichtian climate cooling. The major intra-Campanian truncation surface between the Kometan and Shiranish formations, recognized from the foraminiferal biostratigraphy, represents a lowstand that appears <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> regional tectonics and ophiolite obduction across the NE margin of the Arabian Plate...|$|E

In our study, we investigated {{the relationship of the}} behavioral profile, composed of mindfulness and psychological flexibility, and smoking status on delay and probability discounting. We demonstrated the interaction of the behavioral profile of mindfulness and psychological flexibility (lower or higher) and smoking status on delay discounting. We found that individuals who smoked and displayed higher mindfulness and psychological flexibility devalued rewards at a slower rate, compared to smokers with a lower profile. Importantly, in those with a higher profile, smokers discounted rewards no differently than nonsmokers. Smokers with a lower profile did display, however, increased impulsivity, compared to nonsmokers. These results suggest that behavioral interventions aiming to modify the behavioral profile with regard to mindfulness and psychological flexibility can indeed support the regulation of elevated impulsivity in smokers <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> that of nonsmokers.

40|$|People and {{politics}} in many western countries appear increasingly hostile to immigration and cultural diversity. Multicultural discourses have been abandoned as public concern rises about European countries becoming too ethnically diverse. Opponents of multicultural approaches believe that western democratic values will be destroyed by too many immigrants whose cultures, religions and values are seen to be either too different or inferior. The claim that diverse values may threaten national identity and damage social cohesion has moved from the far-right periphery to the centre of European politics. Discourses about difference have become more exclusionary and nationalistic, while social cohesion is often being redefined <b>to</b> <b>equate</b> <b>with</b> homogeneity and assimilation.
