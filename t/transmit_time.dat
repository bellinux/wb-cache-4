50|$|The {{completion}} of the first North American electrical telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore on May 24, 1844, introduced a technology that could <b>transmit</b> <b>time</b> signals nearly instantly. On September 28, 1850, the United States adopted two primary meridians of longitude for officially use: the Greenwich Meridian (through the old Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England) for all nautical and international use, and the Washington Meridian (through the old United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.) for more accurate astronomical and domestic use.

30|$|Both TOA- and TDOA-based {{localization}} {{are called}} time-based localization [2], since they both rely on time measurements (either the global {{time or the}} local time). The essence {{of this kind of}} localization problem is how to accurately extract distance-related information (e.g., the time of flight (TOF)). Directly using TOA measurements requires not only perfect clock synchronization between the emitters and the receivers but also the knowledge of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>time</b> [33]. In cooperative networks, where clock synchronization is frequently carried out (because the inner clock might drift over <b>time)</b> and the <b>transmitting</b> <b>times</b> are also piggybacked with the transmitted signals, one can precisely calculate the TOFs from the TOA measurements and then localize the target node. However, it is often very expensive to meet those requirements, and most networks are constrained by limited resources and capabilities. Therefore, in most cases, sensors suffer from two linear nuisance parameters, i.e., the unknown clock biases to the global time and the unknown <b>transmitting</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

His idea was to use what he called [...] "galvanism" [...] or electric signalling to <b>transmit</b> <b>time</b> pulses from Greenwich to slave clocks throughout the country, and perhaps to Europe and the colonies too. The new undersea cable recently installed between Dover to Calais in 1851 raised the possibility of sending time signals between England and France - this would allow longitude differences to be measured very accurately, for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Accurate local {{positioning}} systems usually use {{a network of}} anchor nodes at known locations to track mobile nodes based on the measurement {{of the time of}} arrival (TOA) at anchor nodes of beacon signals transmitted by the mobile nodes. To localize the mobile node either TOA processing, where the unknown <b>transmit</b> <b>time</b> is estimated along with the node location, or time difference of arrival (TDOA) processing, where the <b>transmit</b> <b>time</b> is eliminated before estimating the node location, can be used. We show that the position error bound of both these formulations are the same by analyzing the Cramér-Rao lower bound. When processing data collected in field trials, however, we observed that the TOA processing yields better localization accuracy, and explain this behavior using differential geometry-based curvature measures that show that the TDOA cost function has greater degree of non-linearity.
