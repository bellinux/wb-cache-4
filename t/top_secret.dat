Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> report. Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E

5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

5|$|Finnish–Estonian {{relations}} were closest diplomatically after the Estonian Freedom War in the 1920s, but cooled afterwards. Military relations however remained close.

Nevertheless, the military {{relations were}} <b>top</b> <b>secret,</b> and the countries held joint military exercises. The central {{aim was to}} prevent the Soviet Baltic Fleet from freely using its strength in the Gulf of Finland against either country. Estonia also sought public security guarantees and signed the Baltic Entente in 1934 with Latvia and Lithuania.|$|E

Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E

The unmade prequel serial Quatermass in the Third Reich, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, would have shown Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee {{to escape from the}} country.

50|$|The unusual {{end product}} did not appeal to publishers, {{and it took}} several years before anybody agreed to take it on.

Shea and Wilson were required to cut 500 pages to reduce printing costs on what {{was seen as a}} risky venture, although Wilson states that most of the ideas contained therein made it into his later works.

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's <b>top</b> <b>secret</b> ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home.

Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the Chenghua Emperor’s paintings {{with a particular}} focus on the “Good Omens on New Year’s Day”. As a relatively young and practically inexperienced monarch who ascended the throne {{at the age of}} sixteen, Chenghua Emperor(1447 - 1487, r. 1464 - 1487) was advised by a council of regents in the initial years of his reign. Although the Emperor seemed reticent and reclusive, he chose to express himself through his paintings. The lack of an heir worried him. He wished for good health and more sons. But he could only allude to the ideas of longevity and health obliquely because the affairs of the royal family, as <b>top</b> <b>secrets,</b> were extremely sensitive. This essay examines the Emperor’s wishes implicit in the “Good Omens on New Year’s Day”...|$|R
