50|$|McGrath's work {{in group}} {{dynamics}} included {{the classification of}} group tasks into four basic goals. They are generating, choosing, negotiating and executing. McGrath further sub-divided these four creating 8 <b>types</b> of <b>tasks.</b> <b>Type</b> 1 is generating plans (planning tasks); type 2 is generating ideas (creativity tasks); type 3 is solving problems with correct answers (intellective tasks); type 4 is deciding issues with no right answer (decision making tasks); type 5 is resolving conflicts of view point (cognitive conflict tasks); type 6 is resolving conflicts of interest (mixed motive tasks); type 7 is resolving conflicts of power (contests, battles and competitive tasks); and type 8 is executing performance tasks (performances, psycho-motor tasks). McGrath created a circumplex depicting these eight tasks in quadrants which indicated each <b>type</b> of <b>task</b> as either conflict or cooperation and as either conceptual or behavioral. Creativity and Intellective <b>tasks</b> (<b>types</b> 2 and 3) were in the cooperation and conceptual quadrant. Decision-making tasks and cognitive conflict <b>tasks</b> (<b>types</b> 4 and 5) were in the conflict and conceptual quadrant. Mixed-motive tasks and contests/battles/competitive <b>tasks</b> (<b>types</b> 6 and 7) were in the conflict and behavioral quadrant. Performances/psycho-motor tasks and planning <b>tasks</b> (<b>types</b> 8 and 1) were in the cooperation and behavioral quadrant.|$|R
5000|$|A 1992 {{meta-analysis}} {{suggested that}} overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also {{concluded that the}} size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of overlearning, <b>task</b> <b>type,</b> and length of retention. The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks. The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more retention on both types of task. [...] The length of the retention interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.|$|E
50|$|Vigilance {{research}} conducted with subjects across {{a range of}} ages conflict regarding the ability to maintain alertness and sustained attention with age. In 1991, Parasuraman and Giambra reported a trend towards lower detection rates and higher false alarm rates with age when comparing groups between 19 and 27, 40 and 55, and 70 and 80 years old. Deaton and Parasuraman reported in 1993 that beyond the age of 40 years, a trend towards lower detection rates and higher false alarm rates occurs in both cognitive tasks and sensory tasks, with higher and lower mental workloads respectively. Berardi, Parasuraman and Haxby reported no differences in 2001 in the overall levels of vigilance and the ability to sustain attention over time for when comparing middle aged (over 40) and younger subjects. Age dependent differences in cognitive tasks may differ with <b>task</b> <b>type</b> and workload, and some differences in detection and false alarms {{may be due to the}} reduction in the sensitivity of sensory organs.|$|E
5000|$|Some data {{gathered}} from dichotic listening test experiments {{suggests that there}} is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011), [...] "Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of <b>task</b> <b>type</b> (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women. However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in [...] "Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test," [...] women reported more [...] "intrusions" [...] of words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.|$|E

The objective of this research is to identify the suitability of the labeled tasks design in Pathway to English with the relevant theory of five learning cycles in scientific approach, namely: observing, questioning, exploring, associating, and communicating activities. This study is qualitative research which involves content analysis approach. The object of this research is the tasks in English textbook Pathway to English for the tenth grade of Senior High School written by Th. M. Sudarwati and Eudia Grace published by Erlangga in 2013. In collecting the data, the researcher uses documentation technique. The data are analyzed using Creswell’s theory. The study reveals that not all <b>task</b> <b>types</b> in textbook are relevant to five learning cycles of Curriculum  2013. The result shows that 59. 4 % <b>task</b> <b>types</b> are relevant to scientific approach, while  40. 6 % <b>task</b> <b>types</b> are irrelevant to scientific approach. Considering the result above, it can be concluded that the tasks design in Pathway to English are not sufficient to provide students activities and cannot measure entire students’ knowledge, skill and attitude as the important competence in 2013 curriculum...|$|R
50|$|Running {{processes}} {{are those that}} use a processor resource and are marked as 'running'. Processes that are ready to be assigned to a processor, {{when there is no}} free processor are placed in the ready queue. Processes may be assigned a “Declared” or “Visible” priority, generally 50 as the default, but can be from 0 to 99 for user processes. System processes may be assigned the higher values. Note that this numerical priority is secondary to an overall priority, which is based on the <b>task</b> <b>type.</b> Processes that are directly part of the operating system, called Independent Runners, have the highest priority regardless of numeric priority value. Next come processes using an MCP lock, then Message Control Systems such as CANDE. Then Discontinued processes. Then Work Flow Language jobs. Finally come user processes. At a lower level there is a Fine priority intended to elevate the priority of tasks that do not use their full processor slice. This allows an IO bound task to get processor time ahead of a processor bound task on the same declared priority.|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, we {{examined}} the correspondence between the dynamics of metacognitive judgments and classification accuracy when {{participants were asked to}} learn category structures of different levels of complexity, i. e., to learn tasks of types I, II and III according to Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961). The stimuli were simple geometrical figures varying in the following three dimensions: color, shape, and size. In Experiment 1, we found moderate positive correlations between confidence and accuracy in <b>task</b> <b>type</b> II and weaker correlation in <b>task</b> <b>type</b> I and III. Moreover, the trend analysis in the backward learning curves revealed that there is a non-linear trend in accuracy for all three task types, but the same trend was observed in confidence for the <b>task</b> <b>type</b> I and II but not for <b>task</b> <b>type</b> III. In Experiment 2, we found that the feeling-of-warmth judgments (FOWs) showed moderate positive correlation with accuracy in all task types. Trend analysis revealed a similar non-linear component in accuracy and metacognitive judgments in <b>task</b> <b>type</b> II and III but not in <b>task</b> <b>type</b> I. Our results suggest that FOWs are a more sensitive measure of the progress of learning than confidence because FOWs capture global knowledge about the category structure, while confidence judgments are given at the level of an individual exemplar...|$|E
40|$|Vocabulary {{knowledge}} {{influences the}} learners’ performance so remarkably that success in all language skills {{is closely related}} to it. This vital role necessitates studies focusing on the most effective programs of teaching vocabulary. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of static versus dynamic <b>task</b> <b>type</b> and the possible interaction with field dependence/independence cognitive style on learning English vocabulary among intermediate EFL learners. Eighty four female EFL learners studying at the BS level at the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences aged 19 - 25 were randomly selected and given a Cognitive Style Test and a Nelson Proficiency Test (2000 A) to be assigned to either of the control and experimental groups matched for their vocabulary knowledge and cognitive style. Although the two groups were exposed to identical reading passages during classes held twice a week in the four-month treatment period, the control group received vocabulary instruction through static <b>task</b> <b>type</b> technique based on the traditional approach to teaching vocabulary while the experimental group underwent dynamic <b>task</b> <b>type</b> technique. The Nelson Proficiency Test was once more used as the post-test to show the differences in vocabulary gain in the two groups. The collected data were analyzed through ANOVA, using SPSS software. The results showed that vocabulary instruction led to favorable results among field-dependent learners taught by the dynamic <b>task</b> <b>type</b> technique and poorest performance in field-dependent students exposed to the static <b>task</b> <b>type</b> technique while field-independent learners better performed through the static task-type technique. <b>Task</b> <b>type</b> significantly influences vocabulary learning and may marginally affect reading comprehension performance. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} EFL learners’ frequency of negotiation of meaning when performing focused and unfocused communication tasks.

Amazingly, despite the existence of the trigger of negotiation, the indicator of misunderstanding, an important negotiation phase, was absent in many cases from the conversations in both <b>task</b> <b>types.</b> Subsequently, the research findings suggest providing learners with opportunities that urge them to perform as language users rather than language learners...|$|R
