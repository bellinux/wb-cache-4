40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{any difference between}} the attributions parents made about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, in {{parents of children with}} an Autism Spectrum Disorder and parents of children with Down Syndrome. Seventy-six parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and fifty-two parents of children with Down Syndrome completed a series of questionnaires on-line, regarding <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, <b>their</b> beliefs about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and the parent’s level of anxiety and depression. A significant difference was found between the groups on four of the causal items; other health problem, child’s emotional state, child’s personality and diet. Parents of children with Down Syndrome showed a higher level of agreement that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to another health problem compared to parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder showed a higher level of agreement that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> personality, <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> emotional state and <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> diet compared to parents of children with DS. There was a high level of agreement across all parents that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> disability was a causal factor to their sleep problem and differences in attributions may reflect characteristics of the child’s diagnosis. The results are consistent with previous findings that parents view disability as an important causal factor to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and suggest a possible overlap in parent’s views of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and views of their disability...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how a child’s {{experience}} of pain affects his or her parents. Using a vignette methodology, this study investigated the emotional responses of parents who were asked to imagine different painful situations that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> might experience. A sample of 650 parents of school children (325 mothers; 325 fathers) read 8 short stories/vignettes about <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> which varied in terms of type of situation (pain vs other stressful situation), intensity (high vs low), and frequency of occurrence (high vs low). The role of individual differences in parental catastrophizing about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain, catastrophizing about their own pain, dispositional empathy, and gender was also investigated. Parents’ dispositional empathy {{was found to have}} an impact on parental distress and concern for <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Catastrophizing about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain had a unique contribution to parents’ emotional responses to the vignettes describing <b>their</b> <b>child</b> in pain, beyond the influence of other variables. The impact of parental catastrophizing about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain was most pronounced for parental distress, probably reflecting the high threat value that they attribute to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain.

40|$|Tailored pain {{management}} strategies are urgently needed for youth with co-occurring chronic pain and obesity; however, prior to developing such strategies, {{we need to}} understand parent perspectives on weight in the context of pediatric chronic pain. Participants in this study included 233 parents of patients presenting to a multidisciplinary pediatric chronic pain clinic. Parents completed a brief survey prior to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> initial appointment; questions addressed parents’ perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight, and <b>their</b> perceptions of multiple aspects of the relationship between <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight and chronic pain. The majority (64 %) of parents of youth with obesity accurately rated <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight; this group of parents was also more concerned (p < 0. 05) about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight than parents of youth with a healthy weight. However, the majority of parents of youth with obesity did not think <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> weight contributed to his/her pain, or that weight was relevant to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain or pain treatment. Overall, only half of all parents saw discussions of weight, nutrition, and physical activity as important to treating <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> pain.

5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence.

Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools.

For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with <b>their</b> <b>children</b> was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore from parents' {{perspectives}} the circumstances and events which led to <b>their</b> <b>child</b> being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). The objective was to understand reasons for delays in seeking treatment and parents' emotional reactions to diagnosis so others can be better informed and supported in future. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 54 parents of children (aged ≤ 12 [*]yr) with T 1 D were conducted. Data analysis used an inductive, thematic approach. RESULTS: Parents described a 'prompt' and a 'delayed' pathway to <b>their</b> <b>child</b> being diagnosed. Parents who considered the diagnosis to be 'prompt' reported how they, or other people, had recognized <b>their</b> <b>child</b> had developed symptoms of T 1 D which resulted in a rapid presentation to health care professionals. In contrast, parents who perceived <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> diagnosis to be 'delayed' did not recognize signs of T 1 D and attributed <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> deteriorating health to other conditions, being out of routines and/or their stage of development. These parents often only sought medical help when symptoms became extreme. All parents were distressed by <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> diagnosis; however, parents in the 'delayed' pathway expressed unresolved feelings of guilt, particularly when <b>their</b> <b>child</b> was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis. DISCUSSION: Parents' and other people's knowledge about T 1 D can affect the duration between onset of <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> symptoms and diagnosis. Campaigns to raise awareness should ensure that parents are made aware of symptoms and that T 1 D can develop during childhood. Health care professionals could discuss with parents the events preceding <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> diagnosis to better determine their emotional support nee...|$|R
