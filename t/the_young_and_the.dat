5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Tracey E. Bregman was {{the first}} winner of this award for her role of Lauren Fenmore on <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Restless.

The category was renamed Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series in 1989 and began using its current title in 1991.

5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
