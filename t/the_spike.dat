50|$|One {{significant}} {{way in which}} different versions vary is in the arrangement for releasing <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> for their lethal drop. This depends on the story that is built around the trick {{as part of the}} performance. Sometimes it is presented as having a timing device automatically release <b>the</b> <b>spikes,</b> while other performers have their assistants appear to cut through a securing cable or merely let go of the cable at the appropriate moment. In many performances, the rope which supports <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> in their raised position is set alight, releasing <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> when it has apparently burned through {{to the point where it}} no longer has the strength to support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>spikes.</b>|$|R
25|$|A single stem bears 20 to 30 fruiting <b>spikes.</b> <b>The</b> harvest {{begins as}} soon as one or two fruits at the base of <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> begin to turn red, and before the fruit is fully mature, and still hard; if allowed to ripen completely, the fruit lose pungency, and {{ultimately}} fall off and are lost. <b>The</b> <b>spikes</b> are collected and spread out to dry in the sun, then the peppercorns are stripped off <b>the</b> <b>spikes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was <b>the</b> <b>spike</b> in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E

50|$|Technically this {{is often}} {{achieved}} based on different sizes of <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> (simple but inaccurate version) or more sophisticated analyses which {{make use of the}} entire waveform of <b>the</b> <b>spikes.</b> <b>The</b> techniques often use tools such as principal components or wavelet analysis.|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{effectiveness}} of installing spikes (® EcoPic E- 5) on building eaves and windows to avoid the nesting of house martins. We found that <b>spikes</b> cannot prevent <b>the</b> nesting or reduce colony size. The first year after installing <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> <b>the</b> colony may be partially affected. However house martins are able to overcome <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> in <b>the</b> next years and rebuild the nests even on <b>the</b> <b>spikes.</b> We conclude that spikes are ineffective as a deterrent system...|$|R
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: <b>the</b> <b>spike</b> went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off <b>the</b> <b>spike,</b> he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect <b>the</b> <b>spike</b> from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Hughes participated {{as a coach}} {{opposite}} Rich Franklin in {{the second}} season of <b>the</b> <b>Spike</b> TV reality television series, The Ultimate Fighter.

50|$|The exact design varies {{slightly}} from one example to another {{but the basic}} arrangement remains constant. <b>The</b> <b>spikes</b> are supported from a frame attached to the table, which also serves to guide them as they are raised and dropped. There is generally some form of pulley or winch mechanism to raise <b>the</b> <b>spikes,</b> which are genuine and heavy. The table itself generally has an array of holes that match the layout of <b>the</b> <b>spikes,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>spikes</b> protrude through <b>the</b> table when they drop. The performer lies {{on his or her}} back on the table and is restrained with a variety of chains, cuffs and manacles.|$|R
40|$|Spiking is {{a useful}} {{approach}} to improve the accuracy of regional or national calibrations when {{they are used to}} predict at local scales. To do this, a small subset of local samples (spiking subset) is added to recalibrate the initial calibration. If <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset is small in comparison with the size of the initial calibration set, then it could have little noticeable effect and a small improvement can be expected. For these reasons, we hypothesized that the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>spiked</b> calibrations can be improved when <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset is extra-weighted. We also hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset selection and the initial calibration size could affect the accuracy of the recalibrated models. To test these hypotheses, we evaluated different strategies to select <b>the</b> best <b>spiking</b> subset, with and without extra-weighting, to spike three different-sized initial calibrations. These calibrations were used to predict the soil organic carbon (SOC) content in samples from four target sites. Our results confirmed that <b>spiking</b> improved <b>the</b> prediction accuracy of the initial calibrations, with any differences depending on <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset used. <b>The</b> best results were obtained when <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset contained local samples evenly distributed in the spectral space, regardless of the initial calibration's characteristics. The accuracy was improved significantly when <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset was extra-weighted. For medium- and large-sized initial calibrations, the improvement from extra-weighting was larger than that caused by <b>the</b> increase in <b>spiking</b> subset size. Similar accuracies were obtained using small- and large-sized calibrations, suggesting that incipient spectral libraries could be useful if <b>the</b> <b>spiking</b> subset is properly selected and extra-weighted. When small-sized spiking subsets were used, the predictions were more accurate than those obtained with ‘geographically-local’ models. Overall, our results indicate that we can minimize the efforts needed to use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy effectively for SOC assessment at local scales...|$|R
5000|$|The magician {{presents}} an upright cabinet {{that is just}} {{big enough to hold}} a person with a little space above their head. The magician then presents a rack of metal spikes.

5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds.

5|$|Some {{time after}} the Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event (251.4Ma), a fungal spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of fungal spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period. However, the relative proportion of fungal spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess, <b>the</b> <b>spike</b> did not appear worldwide, and in many places it did not fall on the Permian–Triassic boundary.|$|E
