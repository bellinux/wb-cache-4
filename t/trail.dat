5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main <b>trail</b> crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon <b>Trail</b> splits from the Oregon <b>Trail</b> and California <b>Trail</b> for good. The Mormon <b>Trail</b> continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The <b>trail</b> meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E

40|$|Globally {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of kilometres of recreational <b>trails</b> traversing natural areas of high conservation value: but what are their impacts and do impacts differ among <b>trails?</b> We compared the effects of four common types of recreational <b>trails</b> [(1) narrow and (2) medium width informal bare earth <b>trails</b> and (3) gravel and (4) tarmac/concrete formal trails] on vegetation adjacent to <b>trails</b> in a high conservation value plant community that is popular for mountain biking and hiking in Australia. Plant species composition was recorded in quadrats {{along the edge of the}} four types of <b>trails</b> and in control sites away from <b>trails.</b> Vegetation cover, the cover of individual growth forms, and species richness along the edges of all four types of <b>trails</b> were similar to the controls, although the wider <b>trails</b> affected plant composition, with the tarmac and gravel <b>trails</b> favouring different species. With very few comparative studies, more research is required to allow managers and researchers to directly compare differences in the severity and types of impacts on vegetation among <b>trails.</b> In the meantime, limiting damage to vegetation on the edge of hardened <b>trails</b> during construction, use and maintenance is important, and hardening <b>trails</b> may not always be appropriate.
