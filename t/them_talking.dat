5|$|Her {{appearances}} {{became more}} regular from July 2014 onwards, with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian's actions to Denise's protective father figure, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). In August 2014, Ian's friend Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, pulled over behind Ian and Rainie {{when he spotted}} <b>them</b> <b>talking.</b> Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick, believing {{him to be a}} customer of her prostitute services. The police then pulled up behind Mick, and arrested him for soliciting. When Ian explained Rainie's blackmail, Mick agreed to cover for him, {{to ensure the safety of}} his fake alibi. As a result of this, Rainie was reconciled with her mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), as Cora supported Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in court before bumping into her daughter. Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora, and pretends the allegations against Mick are true.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots <b>them</b> <b>talking.</b> Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Rainie {{returns to}} Tanya's house as their mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), is visiting. Rainie {{says she is}} now {{completely}} clean and is staying with Cora because her counsellor wants her to reconnect with her family. When Tanya and Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) go on their honeymoon, Rainie looks after their house and meets Phil at R. They talk about their past but he tells her {{that he does not}} want to associate with her and leaves. She and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) then get drunk together and later go to his flat and have sex. Jack rejects Rainie the following morning. Tanya and Greg return and see how much trouble Rainie has caused. She also causes trouble with Shirley so Tanya asks her to leave but Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay, much to Greg's disappointment. Rainie visits Jack's wife Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) to find the knickers she supposedly left behind and taunts Ronnie, asking her to tell Jack to phone her, leading to her being kicked out again. She joins a support group to help her stay off drugs and alcohol which Phil also attends. Rainie struggles and calls her drug dealer but Phil catches Rainie with drugs and takes them from her, destroying them. She gets drunk and goes to Tanya's salon, where Tanya takes her home. Greg throws her out after Tanya lies that Rainie tried to stab her. A few days later, Phil finds Rainie in the pub and Shirley catches <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> and wrongly assumes they are romantically involved but finds out that Phil has been sponsoring Rainie. Shirley almost gives Rainie a job in the caf√© but changes her mind.|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is just the two of <b>them</b> <b>talking,</b> which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E
500|$|Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear (aged 23 and 24, respectively) were {{attacked}} on the Eastbank Esplanade on May 22, 2011, after holding hands while {{walking across the}} Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Details of the attack were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from Tom McCall Waterfront Park across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade. According to the description released by Portland Police, [...] "as [...] walked they knew several men were behind <b>them</b> <b>talking,</b> laughing and pointing {{but they were not}} sure it was directed at them." [...] Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call 9-1-1. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled that he did not hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form. Police investigated the case as a [...] "bias crime", noting the lack of provocation. The five men who attacked Forkner and Rosevear have so far not been identified.|$|E

When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
500|$|Archie's {{murder was}} {{compared}} to that of Den Watts in EastEnders in 2005 by Polly Hudson of the Daily Mirror, while Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian called it a rip-off of Citizen Kane. Andrew Grimes from Manchester Evening News said the Christmas Day episode was [...] "in every sense compelling, and to my utter astonishment, a complete and utter joy", and John Gibson of Edinburgh Evening News gave the murder discovery episode on 26 December 2009 a negative review, saying [...] "Hard to tell what was most horrific... the murder, which was bloody, the acting, which was dire, or the script, which was torture." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times called the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", while Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable". The storyline was nominated in the Killer Secret category at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. It also received a nomination in the Best Storyline category at the 2010 British Soap Awards and the Best Soap Storyline category at the 2010 TVChoice Awards. Real life police detectives criticised the portrayal of detectives in the show, saying that viewers who see <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> to residents about the case and accepting bribes may believe they operate that way in reality. The BBC insisted that a police consultant was used, adding that [...] "this is heightened fiction {{and all the things that}} we show might not always represent real life." [...] The storyline was referenced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown when referring to allegations of bullying, saying [...] "The only thing I haven't been accused of is murdering that guy Archie Mitchell in EastEnders." ...|$|E

[...] At Time.com, Sam Lansky described it as [...] "sophisticated, grownup sci-fi: a movie about aliens for people who don't like movies about aliens." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying: [...] "Arrival is a language lesson masquerading as a blockbuster, though much more entertaining than that sounds...it's smart, sophisticated sci-fi that asks BIG questions, and does {{a pretty good job}} of answering them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Altman {{was one of}} the few filmmakers who [...] "paid full {{attention}} to the possibilities of sound" [...] when filming. He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> over each other with multiple soundtracks. During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a [...] "dense audio experience" [...] for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, [...] "I like to see a lot of stuff going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{commentary}} booth, the producers supplied only one microphone to Walker and Hunt, to avoid <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> over each other. On one occasion, Hunt wanted {{the microphone and}} went up to Walker, who had continued for longer than expected, and grabbed him by the collar, with Walker having his fist near to Hunt. On another occasion, Hunt grabbed the microphone cord and cracked it like a whip, which yanked the microphone out of Walker's hand. Viewers were regularly exposed to his knowledge, insights and dry sense of humour during broadcasts, bringing him a whole new fan base. He was famous for 'rubbishing' drivers he did not think were trying hard enough ‚Äì during the BBC's live broadcast of the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix he described Ren√© Arnoux's comments that non-turbo cars didn't suit the Frenchman's driving skills as [...] "bullshit". He also had a reputation for speaking out against back-markers who held up race leaders and not holding back on any of his commentaries - {{in sharp contrast to the}} gentlemanly Walker.|$|E
2500|$|As he goes in, {{there is}} already another surfer riding the wave, leaving Utah unstable. Utah gets sucked into the wave and faints, but the other surfer bails and rescues Utah. He wakes aboard a yacht with the surfer, Bodhi (√âdgar Ram√≠rez), and his team Roach (Clemens Schick), Chowder (Tobias Santelmann), and Grommet (Matias Varela). They leave him to enjoy the party and he gets acquainted with a girl, Samsara (Teresa Palmer). The next day, Utah finds the men in an {{abandoned}} Paris train station after he overhears <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> about the location. Bodhi gives him an initiation fight and soon he is accepted into the circle. They travel to the Alps for the next ordeal, wingsuit flying through the cliffs [...] "The Life of Wind". The four succeed in their attempt and spend some time together with Samsara. The next day, they climb the snow peaks for the sixth ordeal, snowboarding down a steep mountain of snow. They reach their spot, but Utah decides to extend his line, so the others follow him. Chowder slips and falls to his death, and Utah becomes depressed about it.|$|E

2500|$|Labourer George Hutchinson, {{who knew}} Kelly, {{reported}} that she met him at about 2:00a.m. and asked him for a loan of sixpence. He claimed to be broke and that as Kelly went on her way she was approached by a man of [...] "Jewish appearance". Hutchinson later gave the police an extremely {{detailed description of the}} man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the middle of a dark winter night. He reported that he overheard <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that Kelly and the man headed for her room, that he followed them, and that he saw neither one of them again, laying off his watch at about 2:45. Hutchinson's statement appears to be partly corroborated by laundress Sarah Lewis, who reported seeing a man watching the entrance to Miller's Court as she passed into it at about 2:30 to spend the night with some friends, the Keylers. Hutchinson claimed that he was suspicious of the man because although Kelly seemed to know him, his opulent appearance made him seem very unusual in that neighbourhood, but only reported this to the police after the inquest on Kelly had been hastily concluded. Abberline, the detective in charge of the investigation, thought Hutchinson's information was important and sent him out with officers {{to see if he could}} see the man again. Hutchinson's name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so it is not possible to say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated. In his memoirs Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
