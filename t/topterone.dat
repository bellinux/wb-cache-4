5000|$|<b>Topterone</b> (WIN-17665): An AR {{antagonist}} {{which was}} described in the literature in 1977. Developed as a topical antiandrogen. Was under development {{for the treatment of}} acne but showed poor effectiveness and was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Topterone</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} WIN-17665), {{also known as}} 17α-propyltestosterone or 17α-propylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} that was first reported in 1978 and was developed for topical administration but, due to poor effectiveness, was never marketed.|$|E
50|$|Ethyltestosterone is {{described}} as a very weak AAS and is considerably weaker as an AAS than is methyltestosterone. Analogues with longer C17α chains such as propyltestosterone (<b>topterone)</b> have further greatly reduced androgenic activity or even antiandrogenic activity. In contrast to ethyltestosterone, its 19-demethyl variant, norethandrolone, is a potent AAS comparable in anabolic activity to testosterone propionate.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} structure-activity relationships, the C17α cyanomethyl group of {{dienogest}} {{is responsible for}} its unique antiandrogenic instead of androgenic activity relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. A loss of ability to activate the AR is also seen with other testosterone derivatives with extended-length C17α substituions such as <b>topterone</b> (propyltestosterone) (compare to the AAS ethyltestosterone and methyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (compare to the AAS ethylestrenol).|$|E
50|$|Extension of the C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes {{androgenic}} activity and converts the drug into an antiandrogen, as in <b>topterone</b> (17α-propyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of ethylestrenol). Conversely, {{replacement of the}} C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish androgenic activity, as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to extension of the C17α alkyl chain, extension of the C17α ethynyl chain abolishes androgenic activity, as with dimethisterone (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features extension of the C17α chain {{in the form of}} a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} AR antagonists have been {{developed}} for topical use but have not completed development and hence have never been marketed. These include the steroidal AR antagonists cortexolone 17α-propionate, cyproterone, rosterolone, and <b>topterone</b> and the nonsteroidal AR antagonists cioteronel, inocoterone acetate, RU-22930, RU-58642, and RU-58841. However, one topical AR antagonist, topilutamide (fluridil), has been introduced in a few European countries for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. In addition, a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor and weak estrogen, alfatradiol, has also been introduced in some European countries for the same indication, although its effectiveness is controversial. Spironolactone has been marketed in Italy {{in the form of a}} topical cream under the brand name Spiroderm for the treatment of acne and hirsutism, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer available.|$|E
