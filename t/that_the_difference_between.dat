5|$|While many reviews {{applauded the}} single-player campaign, the {{multiplayer}} mode bore {{the brunt of}} the game's criticism, with MacDonald, Speer and Miller all finding fault with it, describing it as lackluster and stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the developer's vision for the game mode and the finished product made it difficult to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|IGN said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> {{character}} classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or {{incentive to}} replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting {{rather than their}} quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said {{that many of the}} gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very much at all.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{distance}} have elicited much controversy. Results prior to {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a distance of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that {{the distance}} to the Pleiades is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos parallax errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos parallax distance of 126 pc and photometric distance 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to the Pleiades. Those authors note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> these results can be attributed to random error.|$|E
30|$|For the maxillary and mandibular bone {{thickness}} measurements, Student's t test {{showed that}} there were statistically significant <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> study group and the control group {{in terms of the}} pre-treatment to post-treatment changes (to a 99 % probability level; Table  3). However, analysis of this data through the Fisher F test revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups were not significant. In particular, this test verified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two groups in the apparent reduction in buccolingual thickness were not due to effects of the treatments.|$|R
50|$|Michael Rosenfeld says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> {{autonomous}} {{marriages and}} arranged marriages are empirically small; many people meet, date and choose to marry or cohabit {{with those who}} are similar in background, age, interests and social class they feel most similar to, screening factors most parents would have used for them anyway, according to Rosenfeld. Assuming the pool from which mates are screened and selected is large, Rosenfeld suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two approaches to marriages are not as great as some imagine them to be.

5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, he says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of {{what is and is}} not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson {{was also one of the}} reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E

25|$|Although mammal lifespans vary over an {{approximately}} 100:1 range, {{manifestations of}} ageing (cancer, arthritis, weakness, sensory deficit, etc.) {{are similar in}} different species.

All the mammals therefore need all the maintenance mechanisms. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> mammals is in a control mechanism or repair efficiency.|$|E

25|$|One {{objection}} {{that has}} been made to this theory is that it is too complex.

They propose that a syntactic theory that requires less rules would be a more preferable theory.|$|E

25|$|The TARGIT-A {{trial was}} an {{international}} randomised controlled non-inferiority phase III clinical trial led from University College London. 28 centres in 9 countries accrued 2,232 patients {{to test whether}} TARGIT can replace the whole course of radiotherapy in selected patients.

In the TARGIT-B trial, as the TARGIT technique is precisely aimed and given immediately after surgery, in theory it could be able provide a better boost dose to the tumor bed as suggested in phase II studies.|$|E
