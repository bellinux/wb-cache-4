5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes <b>top</b> and <b>gallant</b> <b>masts)</b> from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|R

25|$|Brig sails {{are named}} after the masts {{to which they are}} attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main {{topgallant}} sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are {{named after the}} sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main <b>top</b> <b>gallant</b> studding sails, etc.|$|R
50|$|Investigator Group Wilderness Protection Area is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Investigator Group of islands off {{the west coast of}} Eyre Peninsula in South Australia between 25 km to 70 km south-west of Elliston. The wilderness protection area was proclaimed in August 2011 under the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 in order to protect ‘important haul-out areas for the Australian sea lion and New Zealand fur seal’ and habitat for species such as White-faced storm petrels, Cape Barren geese and mutton birds and the Pearson Island black-footed rock-wallaby. The wilderness protection area was created from land excised from the Investigator Group Conservation Park. It consists of the Ward Islands, the <b>Top</b> <b>Gallant</b> Isles, and the Pearson Isles which consist of Dorothee Island, Pearson Island and Veteran Isles with exception of a portion of land on Pearson Island which is held by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority for ‘lighthouse purposes’. The Wilderness Protection Area is classified as an IUCN Category Ib protected area.|$|R
60|$|When the {{sun rose}} that morning one who stood on the high ridge of the <b>Top</b> <b>Gallants,</b> far to the eastward of Harbor Weal, would have seen seven trails winding down among the rocks and thickets. It needed only a glance {{to show that the}} seven trails, each one as {{clear-cut}} and delicate as that of a prowling fox, were the records of wolves' cautious feet; and that they were no longer beating the thickets for grouse and rabbits, but moving swiftly all together for the edges of the vast barrens where the caribou herds were feeding. Another glance--but here we must have the cunning eyes of Old Tomah the hunter--would have told that two of the trails were those of enormous wolves which led the pack; two others were plainly cubs that had not yet lost the cub trick of frolicking in the soft snow; while three others were just wolves, big and powerful brutes that moved as if on steel springs, and that still held to the old pack because the time had not yet come for them to scatter finally to their separate ways and head new packs of their own in the great solitudes.|$|R
60|$|Noel's {{father and}} Old Tomah were far away, trapping, in the interior; and to Noel with his snares and his bow and arrows fell the {{pleasant}} task of supplying the family's need {{when the stock}} of dried fish melted away. On this March morning he had started with Mooka at daylight to cross the mountains to some great barrens where he had found tracks and knew that a few herds of caribou were still feeding. The sun was dimmed as it rose, and the sun-dogs gave mute warning of the coming storm; but the cupboard was empty at home, and even a little hunter thinks first of the game he is following and lets the storm take care of itself. So they hurried on unheeding,--Noel with his bow and arrows, Mooka with a little bag containing a loaf and a few dried caplin,--peering under every brush pile for the shining eyes of a rabbit, and picking up one big grouse and a few ptarmigan among the bowlders of a great bare hillside. On {{the edges of the}} great barren under the <b>Top</b> <b>Gallants</b> they found the fresh tracks of feeding caribou, and were following eagerly when they ran plump into the wolf trail.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs {{finds himself}} rowing the ship's oars {{with an iron}} ball chained to his foot. He storms up to Sam and demands he gets rid of it. Sam shrugs and chucks the iron ball, plus Bugs, overboard. Bugs storms up to Sam again (without the iron ball) and demands an explanation, but Sam orders Bugs to swab the deck. A short {{argument}} ends with Bugs mopping the deck. As payback, Bugs scrawls insults on the deck ("The Captain's wife wears Army shoes", [...] "The Captain loves Gravel Gertie", [...] "The Captain is a shnook"), which Sam angrily scrubs off. Bugs smugly compliments Sam on [...] "keeping your ship so spic and span." [...] Realizing he's been tricked, Sam points a pistol at Bugs ("Ooh, belay there, ya long-eared galoot! Get aloft and furl the tatter-sole <b>top</b> <b>gallants</b> before I keelhauls you!"). Bugs immediately tricks Sam into thinking that the ship is sinking. Sam jumps into the lifeboat, but Bugs pulls him out and reminds him: [...] "The Captain goes down with his ship". Sam instantly resigns and makes Bugs the captain. After an argument, he accepts; but when Sam gets back on the lifeboat, Bugs pulls him out again to remind him [...] "Women and children first." [...] Sam disguises himself as a panicking hysterical old lady in need of rescuing. Bugs puts Sam in the lifeboat and drops it into the water. Just as Sam starts to row away, Bugs calls him back and throws him the ship's anchor dressed as a baby, sinking Sam and his lifeboat.|$|R
5000|$|During the three-month, {{first-class}} training cruise on the pre-Civil War sloop-of-war , {{before beginning}} his final academic year, Stirling and another cadet were ordered aloft during a severe squall {{to shorten sail}} and send down the topgallant and royal sail yards. [...] "squeezing out tar on every handhold to prevent being blown out into space by the great force {{of the wind and}} the pressure of the solid sheets of rain", Stirling climbed up two vertical shrouds and Jacob's ladders to the <b>top</b> <b>gallant</b> yard, one-hundred and twenty feet above the deck. Succeeding in furling the sails and lowering the yards by [...] "exerting every ounce of strength we could muster and while the gale was at its height", Stirling wrote in his memoirs forty years later, [...] "The physical condition and the confidence acquired that enable you to hang, without batting an eye, by one hand in space with a yawning drop below you are things the modern sailor never attains. That sense of exaltation was well worth the price paid." [...] Having been in the bottom third of his class during the first three years at Annapolis, in his final year of studies, Stirling found the courses more practical to the knowledge and skill he would need as a naval officer. Applying himself to ensure his standing would be high enough to be offered a commission, he improved his academic ranking that year and graduated from the United States Naval Academy on 3 June 1892, twenty-second in a class of forty.|$|R
