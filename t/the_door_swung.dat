2500|$|During the climb, {{the crew}} made {{preparations}} to detour around thunderstorms along the aircraft's track; the Captain anticipated turbulence {{and kept the}} passenger seatbelt sign lit. At 02:09, 17 minutes into the flight, as the plane was passing from [...] to , the flight crew heard a loud [...] "thump" [...] which shook the aircraft. A second and a half later, the forward cargo door blew off. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> out {{with such force that}} it passed its normal stop and slammed {{into the side of the}} fuselage, bursting the fuselage open. [...] Pressure differentials and aerodynamic forces caused the cabin floor to cave in, and 10 seats (G and H of rows 8 through 12) were ejected from the cabin. All 8 passengers seated in these locations were killed (seats 8G and 12G were unoccupied), as was the passenger in seat 9F. [...] A gaping hole was left in the aircraft, through which a flight attendant in the business-class cabin was almost blown out of the aircraft. Passengers and crew members saw her clinging to a seat leg and were able to pull her back inside the cabin, although she was severely injured. Senior flight attendant Laura Brentlinger hung on to the steps leading to the upper deck, and was dangling from them when the decompression occurred.|$|E
60|$|Captain Nugent, who {{was moving}} towards <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>swung</b> round and confronted him savagely.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and {{the girl}} came in gasping, with horror in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|As the Sultan spoke, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} there entered an aged Turk, in a flowing gown and {{coloured}} turban, with a melancholy yellow face, {{and a long}} white beard that swept to his girdle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Mr. Parr, as <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} {{he led the way}} into the house, [...] "I'm sorry I can't give you a more cheerful welcome, but my son and daughter, for their own reasons, see fit to live elsewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|The aide-de-camp {{bowed and}} withdrew. In another moment <b>the</b> half-opened <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> wide to Mistress Thankful Blossom.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to sharply just then, and he started. He {{thought it}} was the cannon.|$|E
60|$|Slowly <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} a man entered the room. Barney breathed a deep sigh of relief--it was Joseph.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{open with}} the same {{promptness}} as before. A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|Trent {{rose and}} opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which <b>swung</b> into <b>the</b> little room.|$|R
60|$|The {{ambassador}} {{arranged the}} combination {{and pressed the}} lever. Slowly <b>the</b> great <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> back. <b>The</b> two men peered in.|$|R
60|$|Semper Idem's {{eyes flashed}} in token that he heard, {{and a moment}} later <b>the</b> {{hospital}} <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to on his heel.|$|R
60|$|Philip's heart gave a great thud {{against his}} ribs, {{and he let}} the door handle go. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to.|$|E
60|$|The key {{was turned}} noiselessly in the lock; {{he raised the}} latch, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open with never a creak.|$|E
60|$|Turning to {{the door}} Billy knocked the bar from its place, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> in and Bridge slipped through to liberty.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two IC3 trains coupled together, <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> aside. Notice <b>the</b> large pins (retracted) {{which are}} {{responsible}} for keeping <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut when <b>the</b> cab is used ...|$|R
6000|$|Then my {{lips and}} eyes were sealed with silence and with darkness, so that I was dumb and blind. The Gates rolled back, <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> <b>swung</b> wide, and I was swept into the city {{that is in the}} Place of Death. I was swept swiftly I know not whither, till at length I stood upon my feet. Again the great Voice pealed: ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with his}} {{powerful}} fists he began pounding against the panels of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which <b>swung</b> loosely under the heavy blows.|$|R
60|$|He thrust it {{into the}} lock and turned it; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{smoothly}} open. The policeman laid his hand upon Tavernake's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Safe and sound,' {{replied the}} man with the ash stick. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> heavily after them, and they descended a small flight of steps.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> inward with a swift scrape and jar. Longstreth half entered, haggard, flaming-eyed. Behind him Duane saw Lawson, and indistinctly another man.|$|E
60|$|Paul had {{a curious}} {{sensation}} of pity, almost of affection, mingled with violent hate, for the man. <b>The</b> coloured <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to; {{there was silence}} in the bar.|$|R
60|$|He {{entered the}} vault. <b>The</b> great <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> slowly to. <b>The</b> {{ponderous}} bolts grated into place. The lock clicked. I {{have never seen}} Captain John Carter, of Virginia, since.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here come {{two of them}} now," [...] said Roger, in a low voice, as <b>the</b> tavern <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{open and}} two young men appeared, each wearing a linen duster and a touring cap.|$|R
60|$|Then the Keeper of the Wicket {{passed through}} and she followed, after which <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> shut and locked {{itself with a}} sharp click.|$|E
60|$|A {{noise in}} the other room startled them both. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and a tall, elderly, dark complexioned man, {{recently}} shaven, hurried into the room.|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked up}} and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, {{starting}} at every trifling sound. Presently <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open, and a silken page said-- ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she caught}} the horse by the bridle, <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> heavily to with a sharp, sudden bang. The horse, a great, powerful, nervous brute, started wildly and then reared in terror.|$|R
60|$|They retraced their {{steps to}} the Moat House. As <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> back on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and {{examined}} the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.|$|R
60|$|A heavy foot crunched {{the gravel}} without. Then <b>the</b> cabin <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> wide, and Canim stalked in. Miss Giddings saw {{a vision of}} sudden death, and screamed; but Mrs. Van Wyck faced him composedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come right in." [...] <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> open. [...] "We {{have already}} {{finished}} eating, but {{the fire is}} burning and I can get something up for you." ...|$|E
60|$|While he was {{wondering}} what it meant, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> suddenly open. A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stone stumbled; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> to; {{the room}} was plunged in darkness. A hand, cold as ice, brushed her cheek. With all her force she stiffed a scream.|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{started to}} take off her hat, but {{suddenly}} {{sat down on the}} bed. She sobbed softly, with considered repression, but <b>the</b> weak-latched <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> noiselessly open, and she was startled by her sister-in-law's voice.|$|R
50|$|Other {{avenues of}} escape were {{similarly}} useless; side doors had been bolted shut to prevent people from leaving without paying. A plate glass window, {{which could have}} been smashed for escape, was boarded up and unusable as an emergency exit. Other unlocked <b>doors,</b> like <b>the</b> ones in the Broadway Lounge, opened inwards, rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape. Fire officials would later testify that had <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> outwards, at least 300 lives could have been spared.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> open, {{and through}} them came a {{procession}} clad in black, {{followed by the}} Shaman Simbri, who walked {{in front of a}} bier, upon which lay the body of the Khan, carried by eight priests. Behind it was Atene, draped in a black veil from head to foot, and after her marched another company of priests. In front of the altar the bier was set down and the priests fell back, leaving Atene and her uncle standing alone before the corpse.|$|R
