5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|Peter, {{discovering}} {{a picture of}} white tulips in Olivia's book, is able to find her nearby. After they introduce themselves, Olivia admits to being scared of going home to her stepfather. Peter tells her to trust Walter and <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> fear, and then returns her to the child care center, to everyone's relief. As Olivia waits for her stepfather, she sketches {{a picture of her}} and Peter in her book. As her stepfather is about to arrive, Olivia decides she must tell Walter about him, and rushes to his office. Olivia, in tears, hands Walter the sketchbook, explaining about her stepfather's abuse and that she knew she had crossed over to the parallel universe. She is interrupted by a sound from behind her: it is Walter. Olivia had temporarily entered the parallel universe and spoken to Walternate. Walter takes Olivia to her stepfather, but warns the man that he will be reported to social services if Olivia is harmed again.|$|E

5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E
25|$|Buffy and the Scoobies {{face the}} First Evil, bent on ending the Slayer line and {{destroying}} the world. Potential Slayers {{from around the}} globe congregate at Buffy's home and she trains them to battle the First Evil. Willow continues <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> grief over Tara's death and, reluctantly, becomes involved with one of the Potentials, Kennedy (Iyari Limon).|$|E
25|$|Mott {{attended}} {{all three}} national Anti-Slavery Conventions of American Women (1837, 1838, 1839). During the 1838 convention in Philadelphia, a mob destroyed Pennsylvania Hall, a newly opened meeting place built by abolitionists. Mott {{and the white}} and black women delegates linked arms to exit the building safely through the crowd. Afterward, the mob targeted her home and Black institutions and neighborhoods in Philadelphia. As a friend redirected the mob, Mott waited in her parlor, willing <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> violent opponents.|$|E

25|$|In the Summer of 542, Constantinople was {{affected}} by the so-called Plague of Justinian. The emperor Justinian himself caught the plague and there were discussions of an imminent succession. Belisarius and Bouzes, both absent in campaign, reportedly swore to oppose any emperor chosen without their consent. Theodora took offense and had them both recalled at Constantinople <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> judgement. Bouzes was captured upon his return. He reportedly spent two years and four months (late 542-early 545) held in an underground chamber, located below the women's quarters of the palace. While eventually released, Procopius suggests that Bouzes continued to suffer from a failing eyesight and ill health {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
25|$|JR {{demands a}} DNA test be conducted, so Babe calls up Paul and {{promises}} him money {{if he will}} make sure the test proves that JR is the father and allow the annulment to go through. Babe and Krystal {{are able to get}} Paul drunk and send him away. Paul is angry and vows revenge on Babe. When Tad finds out about Babe's marriage to Paul, he wants to tell JR, but Krystal is able to seduce him and keep him quiet. Although looking forward to the birth of her child, Babe has <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> next obstacle: Adam and his accomplice, Mary Smythe, are plotting to get Babe out of JR's life as soon as the child is born. JR finds out about his father's scheming and cuts him out of his life as he did to Jamie; {{at the same time he}} renews his friendship with his brother, Jamie, and asks him to be the baby's godfather.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one who killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her.</b> Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E
60|$|Even as {{he faced}} {{me a little}} cry from the girl carried my eyes beyond the brute <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>Hers</b> was {{fastened}} upon me {{with an expression of}} incredulity that baffles description. There was both hope and horror in them, too.|$|R

500|$|Charlie, who rejects formulaic script writing, {{wants to}} ensure that his script is a {{faithful}} adaptation of The Orchid Thief. [...] However, he comes {{to realize that the}} book does not have a usable narrative and {{that it is impossible to}} turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of writer's block. Already well over his deadline with Columbia Pictures, and despairing at writing his script with self-reference, Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Unable <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> and with the surprising news that Donald's spec script for a clichéd psychological thriller, called The 3, is selling for six or seven figures, Kaufman resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.|$|E
500|$|Kentikian won the Hamburg Championships for juniors from 2001 to 2004. She {{also won}} the Northern German Championships for juniors in 2003 and 2004, and in October 2004, she had her biggest amateur success by winning the International German Women's Amateur Championships in the featherweight {{division}} for juniors. Kentikian found {{it increasingly difficult to}} find opponents in the amateur ranks, as few boxers wanted <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> in the ring, and her status as an asylum seeker did not allow her to box outside Hamburg. Kentikian's final amateur record stood at 24 wins and one loss. She later blamed overeagerness for her single loss, having fought despite health problems at the time. Her aggressive style and fast combinations, and her ambition to always attack until she knocked out the opponent earned her the nickname [...] "Killer Queen"; she has often used the identically-named song by the English rock band Queen as her entrance music.|$|E
500|$|Catherine {{was unable}} to control Henry {{in the way she}} had Francis and Charles. Her role in his {{government}} became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face <b>to</b> <b>face.</b> <b>Her</b> efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people. On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: [...] "She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner." [...] She was under no illusions, however. On 25 November 1579, she wrote to the king, [...] "You are {{on the eve of a}} general revolt. Anyone who tells you differently is a liar." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the title}} track [...] "Amor Prohibido", speaks of social {{division}} between a poverty-stricken female {{who falls in love}} with a man from the opposite social class. Its lyrics have been analyzed by authors, musicologists, and critics, who found them relevant to issues facing the LGBT community. They are ambiguous and have been interpreted to be about prohibited romance between same-sex couples, a look into modern society's views of romantic relationships, and to Romeo & Juliet. A review in The Monitor felt that the lyrics portrayed the [...] "forbidden love" [...] between Selena and Pérez from [...] "the ire of her overbearing father". Musically, the titular song is [...] "an emotional up-tempo ballad" [...] which showcases the singer's [...] "passionate side". In [...] "Cobarde", the protagonist recognizes that her lover cheated on her and notices how he is unable <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> after feeling guilty about his behavior. She repeatedly calls him a [...] "coward". Two other tracks, [...] "Ya No" [...] and [...] "Si Una Vez", delve into heartaches of failed relationships with the protagonist in the former song angrily refusing to take back a cheating partner.|$|E
500|$|She {{returned}} to the ring after an absence of seventeen months on the September 15 episode of Raw, saving Trish Stratus from a beating {{at the hands of}} Molly Holly and Gail Kim. Co-General Manager Stone Cold Steve Austin later explained to Eric Bischoff that he had rehired Lita. Lita and Stratus went on to defeat Holly and Kim in a tag team match on September 21 at Unforgiven. Lita feuded with Holly into late 2003, unsuccessfully challenging her for the Women's Championship on November 16 at Survivor Series. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Lita and Matt Hardy were reunited after Hardy was moved from SmackDown! to Raw. Continuing the storyline, Holly interrupted as Hardy was about to propose to Lita, challenging the duo <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> and Bischoff in an intergender tag team match later that evening. Bischoff later added the stipulation that Lita would earn a title shot if she won but would be fired if she lost. Hardy and Lita lost the match after Hardy refused to tag in, with Hardy berating Lita for [...] "selfishly" [...] returning to Raw instead of SmackDown!, claiming that this showed that she cared more about the Women's Championship than about him. Lita was rehired later that evening when Christian informed her that he had used his Survivor Series favor to get Bischoff to reinstate her. One week later, Lita lost to Victoria in the first ever women's steel cage match in WWE history, due to interference from Hardy.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] allows all the {{characters}} to confess truthfully, {{with the exception of}} Willow, it does not resolve the behavior that demanded confession in the first place. At the end of the episode, Buffy kisses Spike, initiating a romance that she hides from her friends. Their relationship lasts {{until the end of the}} series, marked for a time by Buffy's loathing of him because he has no soul. Her relationship with Spike, however, allows her to feel lust and attraction, which she yearns for after being pulled back from a heavenly dimension. In The Psychology of Joss Whedon, Mikhail Lubyansky writes that, although Buffy's first step toward re-engaging with her life is telling the Scoobies the truth in the song [...] "Something to Sing About", she does not find meaning again until the end of the season. In his essay [...] "A Kantian Analysis of Moral Judgment in Buffy the Vampire Slayer", Scott Stroud explains that Buffy, as the central character throughout the series, is torn between her desires and her duty, in a Kantian illustration of free will vs. predeterminism, symbolized by her responsibility as a Slayer and her adolescent impulses. In earlier seasons, this takes the form of simpler pleasures such as dating and socializing, interspersed with defeating evil forces. It reaches a climax in the ultimate sacrifice when Buffy offers to die to save the world. However, [...] "Once More, with Feeling", according to Stroud, is the turning point at which she begins <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> responsibility to the community, her friends and her family. Not only does she continue her Slaying despite a lack of inspiration, but for the rest of the season she works at a humiliating job to provide for her sister and friends.|$|E
60|$|The old rapt, eager look of {{possession}} {{had come back}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> now; <b>her</b> lips were softly parted. Yet even then {{she seemed to be}} waiting some reply more potent than that syllabled on the lips of the man before her.|$|R
60|$|It {{was curious}} {{to watch the}} meeting between Heda and Nombe. The doctoress {{appeared}} just as we had risen from breakfast, and Heda, turning round, came <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{sat down}} {{opposite}} to her; she still held her fan up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> with <b>her</b> eyes only showing above it. There was a moment's silence, {{and then he}} said, returning to his former question, [...] "Have you sent that document to Germany?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{fourth season}} had twelve roles {{receiving}} star billing, with ten of them {{returning from the}} previous season, eight of whom {{are part of the}} original cast from the first one. All the actors who are billed as series regulars portray physicians from the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. The majority of the show's episodes are narrated by Ellen Pompeo, who portrayed protagonist Dr. Meredith Grey, a surgical resident whose storylines are the series' focal points. Sandra Oh acted as Meredith's best friend, highly competitive resident Dr. Cristina Yang. Fellow resident Dr. Isobel [...] "Izzie" [...] Stevens was portrayed by Katherine Heigl, while Dr. Alexander [...] "Alex" [...] Karev was played by Justin Chambers. T.R. Knight acted as insecure resident with self-confidence issues, Dr. George O'Malley, whereas Chandra Wilson portrayed Chief Resident and general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey, former mentor of the five residents during their internship. James Pickens, Jr. portrayed attending physician and general surgeon Dr. Richard Webber, who continues his position as Chief of Surgery, despite his former wishes of retirement. Orthopedic surgeon and fifth-year resident Dr. Calliope [...] "Callie" [...] Torres, who was portrayed by Sara Ramirez, has <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> husband's unfaithfulness and her unexpected bisexuality. Attending plastic surgeon, Dr. Mark Sloan was portrayed by Eric Dane, who is constantly seeking reconciliation with former best friend, attending physician and Chief of Neurosurgery Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), whose lasting relationship with Meredith Grey faces difficulties. Former Reunion star Chyler Leigh was promoted to series regular status, after short appearances in the final two episodes of the third season, portraying Meredith's half-sister Lexie Grey, who opts for a surgical internship at Seattle Grace Hospital against Massachusetts General Hospital, after her mother's sudden death. Silence of the Lambs star, Brooke Smith was upgraded to series regular status after multiple guest appearances {{in the second and third}} seasons. An antagonizing character at first, she replaces Preston Burke as the Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, constantly displaying disrespect for Cristina's previous relationship with him.|$|E
2500|$|Making {{her debut}} in Women Superstars Uncensored in September, she was {{introduced}} Missy Hyatt who interviewed Orsani on her interview segment [...] "Missy's Manor". During the interview, she {{was confronted by}} wrestler Rick Cataldo and attacked him when he attempted to interrupt her interview. She was then challenged moments later by former tag team partner Amy Lee and agreed <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> the following week.|$|E
2500|$|Blair {{starred in}} the music video for Danko Jones' [...] "Full of Regret"; the video also {{featured}} Elijah Wood and Lemmy Kilmister. She next had a guest role in three episodes of the online series Web Therapy starring Lisa Kudrow, and appeared as a guest judge in Heidi Klum's fashion reality show Project Runway. She appeared in a supporting role as a lesbian teacher in the small-scale black comedy The Family Tree (2011), with Madeline Zima, and {{starred in the}} psychological thriller Columbus Circle, with Amy Smart and Giovanni Ribisi, playing an agoraphobic heiress who has <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>her</b> fears after she killed a man in her apartment. Filming for Columbus Circle took place in 2009, but the movie received a straight-to-DVD release in March 2012.|$|E
60|$|Mabel {{dropped her}} hands, arose, and stood <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>her</b> two suitors, though the flush {{that was on}} her cheeks was feverish, the {{evidence}} of excitement rather than of shame.|$|R
60|$|She shuffled {{forward on}} her knees, {{and put her}} arms round him, round his legs, as he stood there, {{pressing}} her breasts against his knees and thighs, clutching him with strange, convulsive certainty, pressing his thighs against her, drawing him <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>her</b> throat, as {{she looked up at}} him with flaring, humble eyes, of transfiguration, triumphant in first possession.|$|R
