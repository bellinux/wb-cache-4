5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> demonstrating {{and later}} formalizing Managed Medicare into Part C of Medicare {{had been the}} {{expectation}} that the introduction of competition among the participating insurance companies would provide higher-quality care and plans that were more responsive to beneficiaries' needs than traditional Medicare, at similar or lower cost.|$|R

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain. One {{of the most widely}} known {{theories}} is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E

Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E
5|$|When Richard died, {{his brother}} John – Henry’s fifth and only {{surviving}} son – took the throne.

Where no distinction is made between the Angevinsand Angevin era and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.

5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>behind</b> the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{discusses}} a securities disclosure issue {{stemming from}} a split between the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit. The question presented is whether failure {{to comply with a}} disclosure requirement created by Item 303 of Regulation S-K can provide a basis for liability under section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10 b- 5. The Ninth Circuit held that such violation does not provide a basis for liability. Conversely, in Stratte-McClure v. Morgan Stanley, the Second Circuit explicitly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit and concluded that this violation may serve as a basis for liability. This Note examines <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> each decision, as well as <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>behind</b> disclosure regulations more generally, and ultimately concludes that Item 303 violations should serve as a basis for 10 b- 5 liability, as long as all of the remaining requirements of a 10 b- 5 claim are met...|$|R
