50|$|The PYGB gene encodes one {{of three}} major {{glycogen}} phosphorylase isoforms, which are distinguished by their different structures and subcellular localizations: brain (PYGB), muscle (PYGM), and liver (PYGL).

Nonetheless, it shares high homology in amino acid sequence {{with the other two}} isozymes, with 83% similarity with PYGM and 80% similarity with PYGL. Moreover, both its nucleotide and amino acid sequences and its codon usage share higher similarity with those of PYGM, thus indicating that the two share a closer evolutionary descent by <b>gene</b> duplication and <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common ancestral <b>gene.</b> <b>A</b> possible pseudogene can be found on chromosome 10.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> {{clinical}} isolate <b>of</b> Escherichia coli from {{a patient}} in Japan, isolate KU 6400, was found to produce a plasmid-encoded β-lactamase that conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and cephamycins. Resistance arising from production <b>of</b> <b>a</b> β-lactamase could be transferred by either conjugation or transformation with plasmid pKU 601 into E. coli ML 4947. The substrate and inhibition profiles of this enzyme resembled those of the AmpC β-lactamase. The resistance gene of pKU 601, which was cloned and expressed in E. coli, proved to contain an open reading frame showing 99. 8 % DNA sequence identity with the ampC gene of Citrobacter freundii GC 3. DNA sequence analysis also identified <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> upstream <b>of</b> ampC whose sequence was 99. 0 % identical to the ampR gene from C. freundii GC 3. In addition, a fumarate operon (frdABCD) and an outer membrane lipoprotein (blc) surrounding the ampR-ampC genes in C. freundii were identified, and insertion sequence (IS 26) elements were observed {{on both sides of}} the sequences identified (forming an IS 26 composite transposon); these results confirm the evidence <b>of</b> the <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> β-lactamase-associated <b>gene</b> region from the chromosome to a plasmid.

40|$|We have cloned the cDNA {{encoding}} <b>a</b> new isozyme <b>of</b> {{glycogen phosphorylase}} (1, 4 -D-glucan:orthosphosphate D-glucosyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 1) from a cDNA library prepared {{from a human}} brain astrocytoma cell line. Blot-hybridization analysis reveals that this message is preferentially expressed in human brain, but it also found at a low level in human fetal liver and adult liver and muscle tissues. Although previous {{studies have suggested that}} the major isozyme of phosphorylase found in all fetal tissues is the brain type, our data show that the predominant mRNA in fetal liver (24 -week-gestation) is the adult liver form. The protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the brain phosphorylase cDNA in 862 amino acids long compared with 846 and 841 amino acids for the liver and muscle isozymes, respectively; the greater length of brain phosphorylase is entirely due to an extension at the far C-terminal portion of the protein. The muscle and brain isozymes share greater identity with regard to nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, codon usage, and nucleotide composition than either do with the liver sequence, suggesting a closer evolutionary relationship between them. Spot blot hybridization of the brain phosphorylase cDNA to laser-sorted human chromosome fractions, and Southern blot analysis of hamster/human hybrid cell line DNA reveals that the exact homolog of the newly cloned cDNA maps to chromosome 20, but that a slightly less homologous gene is found on chromosome 10 as well. The liver and muscle genes have previously been localized to chromosomes 14 and 11, respectively. This suggests that the phosphorylase genes evolved by duplication and <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common ancestral <b>gene,</b> leading to divergence of elements controlling gene expression and of structural features of the phosphorylase proteins that confer tissue-specific functional properties...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a sex {{reversed}} Japanese child with a 46,X,Yp+ karyotype, minor dysmorphic features, and no testicular development. The Yp+ chromosome was derived by <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Xp fragment (Xp 21 -Xp 22. 3) to Yp 11. 3. This has resulted in deletion of distal part of the Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (DXYS 15 -telomere) and duplication of the X specific region (DXS 84 -PABX) and proximal part of the pseudoautosomal region (MIC 2 -DXYS 17). No deletion of the Y specific region was detected nor was any mutation found in SRY. Cytogenetic analysis suggests that the proximal part of the Xp fragment is the most distal part of the short arm of the Yp+ chromosome (Xp 21 [...] Xp 22. 3 ::Yp 11. 3 [...] Yqter). No chromosomal mosaicism was detected. These results are similar to previous reports of sex reversal in four subjects with a 46,Y,Xp+ karyotype.

The products of this enzyme, i. e. inositides phosphorylated in the D 3 position of the inositol ring, may act as second messengers themselves. Nuclear PI 3 K translocation has been demonstrated to be related to <b>an</b> analogous <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 activated PKC, the ζ isozyme. We have examined the {{issue of whether or not}} in the osteoblast-like clonal cell line MC 3 T 3 -E 1 there may be observed an insulin-like growth factor-I- (IGF-I) and platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF) dependent nuclear <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active Akt/PKB.

Both growth factors increased rapidly and transiently the enzyme activity of immunoprecipitable nuclear Akt/PKB on a similar time scale and after 60 min the values were slightly higher than the basal levels. Enzyme translocation was blocked by the specific PI 3 K inhibitor, LY 294002, as well as cell entry into S-phase. Confocal microscopy showed an evident increase in immunostaining intensity in the nuclear interior after growth factor treatment but no changes in the subcellular distribution <b>of</b> Akt/PKB when <b>a</b> LY 294002 pre-treatment was administered to the cells.

40|$|Aromatase {{protein is}} overexpressed in the breasts of women {{affected}} with cancer. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), signal sequence and signal anchors (SAs) facilitate <b>translocation</b> and topology <b>of</b> proteins. To understand {{the function of}} type-I SAs (SA-Is), we evaluated <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> aromatase, whose signal anchor follows a hydrophilic region. Aromatase SA-I mediates <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short N-terminal hydrophillic domain to ER lumen and integrates the protein in the membrane, with {{the remainder of the}} protein residing in the cytosol. We showed that lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> signal peptidase cleavage site is not responsible for the stop-transfer function of SA-I. However, SA-I could not block the <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-length microsomal secretory protein and was cleaved as part of the signal sequence. We propose that interaction between the translocon and the region after the signal anchor plays a critical role in directing the topology of the protein by SA-Is. The positive charges in the signal sequence helped it to override the function of signal anchor. Thus, when signal sequence follows SA-I immediately, the interaction with the translocon is perturbed and topology of the protein in ER is altered. If signal sequence is placed far enough from SA-I, then it does not affect membrane integration of SA-I. In summary, we conclude that {{it is not just the}} SA-I, but also the region following it, which together affect function of aromatase SA-I in ER...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} {{mechanism for}} proton conduction along hydrogen-bonded chains, or “proton wires,” is studied with free energy simulations. The complete transport <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charge along a proton wire requires two complementary processes: 1) <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> excess proton (propagation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ionic defect), and 2) reorientation of the hydrogen-bonded chain (propagation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bonding defect). The potential of mean force profile {{for these two}} steps is computed in model systems comprising <b>a</b> single-file chain <b>of</b> nine dissociable and polarizable water molecules represented by the PM 6 model of Stillinger and co-workers. Results of molecular dynamics simulations with umbrella sampling indicate that the unprotonated chain is preferably polarized, and that the inversion of its total dipole moment involves an activation free energy of 8 kcal/mol. In contrast, the rapid <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> excess H+ across a chain extending between two spherical solvent droplets is an activationless process. These {{results suggest that the}} propagation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bonding defect constitutes a limiting step for the passage of several protons along single-file chains of water molecules, whereas the ionic translocation may be fast enough to occur within the lifetime of transient hydrogen-bonded water chains in biological membranes...|$|R

In vivo, intranuclear synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) trisphosphate (PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P(3)) was stimulated by EPO. Almost all PtdIns 3 -K that translocated to the nucleus was highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues of the p 85 regulatory subunit.
