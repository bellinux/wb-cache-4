5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film, top-rated {{television}} show, and singing on the number-one album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. Universal Studios narrowly beat Paramount Pictures for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in Animal House, was aboard as director.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Ace Cafe {{was based}} on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers knew <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> quick getaway. Regus founder Mark Dixon's first business on returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns. He grew the business into a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of Æthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped {{to increase the number of}} pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.|$|E

50|$|Rayón {{sent his}} infantry, baggage and {{supplies}} {{to the town of}} La Piedad de Cavadas, but remained in his position at El Maguey with 14 pieces of artillery and a cavalry picket to fight a rearguard action against the overwhelming advancing Spanish forces. The stand was meant to give his infantry time to escape their pursuers so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> organized retreat from the Spanish. General Emparan gave battle and the two armies maneuvered for position around the ranch.|$|R
50|$|In release 1.0b1, EAC {{supported}} the downloading of CD cover art, and in b2, an option {{was added to}} have the ID3 information, such as artist, CD title, track names, and cover art downloaded automatically from the GD3 database. The GD3 option allowed a user who set up <b>an</b> account to <b>make</b> 10 free initial queries, but afterwards required them to pay a fee of US$7.99, after which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> unlimited number of queries. Release 1.0b1 removed support for Windows 2000 and older versions of Windows.|$|R
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E

Soon, he makes a proposition. Bennet tells Mohinder that together <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference, and asks Mohinder to join him. Mohinder says he isn't interested, but Bennet leaves his card anyway.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 artist Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock {{introduced}} Montague to illustrator Coles Phillips, also {{a resident}} of New Rochelle. A noted pigeon fancier, Phillips suggested to Montague that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount of money raising and selling squabs to restaurants and hotels. The breed chosen was the red carneau. Together they bought four acres of land on Webster Avenue near the Wykagyl Country Club, built a row of pigeon houses and installed 4,000 birds. The result, called the Silver Ring Squab Farm, had set the two back a total of $15,000.|$|E
60|$|As {{ten o'clock}} approached, {{the two friends}} sat with open door, {{listening}} intently for every sound. Conversation was still {{going on in the}} houses, and occasionally <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> out <b>a</b> dark figure crossing the yard.|$|R

25|$|While {{this was}} going on, the right {{detachment}} under Keyes, having found itself {{on the wrong side}} of the river, made contact with an Australian battalion to the south which brought up a boat with which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> crossing. Due to the size of the boat, it had to make a number of trips before the detachment was on the northern side. Once that was complete Keyes was able to take command of the unit. After carrying out a reorganisation, he was able to launch an assault on the redoubt and by 13:00 they had captured it and secured the crossing.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Roeder joined Championship side Norwich City, {{signing a}} {{contract}} until 2010, with Norwich {{bottom of the}} division and four points adrift of safety. His first game in charge was on 4 November in the East Anglian Derby against Ipswich Town, a match that ended 2–2 after Norwich had been 2–0 down at half-time. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3-1 defeat of fellow strugglers Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost at home that season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with wins over Plymouth Argyle, Sheffield United, Scunthorpe United, Barnsley, Southampton, Preston North End and Cardiff City. The Canaries rose rapidly up the table {{as a result of}} this good run of form and, at one stage, it looked as though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> shock late burst into the play-offs, similar to the run under Nigel Worthington in the 2001/2002 season. Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as Julien Brellier and David Strihavka who had been signed by his predecessor and who he did not consider to have a future at the club. He made the loan signing of Matty Pattison permanent and also renewed the loan deals for Ched Evans and Mo Camara. Roeder also made four loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3-0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Hessians in {{the field}} {{attempted}} to reorganize, and make one last attempt to retake the town so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> breakout.

Advance!", and the Hessians began to move, with the brigade's band playing fifes, bugles and drums to help the Hessians' spirit.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the very}} first SEA {{to be carried out}} in Denmark and was carried out before the {{introduction}} of the EU SEA Directive. As a result of this pilot SEA, the major concern amongst stakeholders was reconciling negative environmental impacts that resulted from planning activities. Overall, while stakeholders felt that no new knowledge was gained from carrying out an SEA, the planning process became more transparent. Politicians felt that there was more information on which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> informed decision about the choices presented to them. It was also decided that consultation should be carried out during the scoping process, rather than at later stages of the SEA process.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{breakthrough}} of 1976, Cruzeiro were {{again in the}} final of the 1977 session. However, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> double and were defeated by another Argentine team, Boca Juniors, which were famous for their defense led by the goalkeeper Hugo Gatti.|$|R
60|$|The spot {{selected}} for the sports {{was a sort of}} esplanade, a little west of the fort, and on the immediate bank of the lake. It had been cleared of its trees and stumps, that it might answer the purpose of a parade-ground, as it possessed the advantages of having its rear protected by the water, and one of its flanks by the works. Men drilling on it could be attacked, consequently, on two sides only; and as the cleared space beyond it, {{in the direction of the}} west and south, was large, any assailants would be compelled to quit the cover of the woods before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> approach sufficiently near to render them dangerous.|$|R
500|$|The {{relative}} {{failure of}} Allegro reinforced the team's determination {{to have another}} hit. [...] Author James Michener recalled his meeting with the duo over the possibility of converting his book Tales of the South Pacific into a musical. [...] "They were inwardly burning because of the reception accorded to Allegro. [...] Those fellows were so mad I was fairly certain that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> great musical out of the Bronx telephone directory." [...] That project would become South Pacific and be a tremendous hit.|$|E
500|$|Forman recounted {{this memory}} to fellow film enthusiasts and colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav Papousek {{and asked them}} if {{it might be the}} basis for a good film. [...] "Maybe", replied Passer, [...] "but it still needs one more thing – a billiards table." [...] The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> success of even the weakest idea if they had ready access to a table. Having found a good one at Dobříš Castle, the three, along with Václav Sasek, wrote a {{screenplay}} that fleshed out Forman's encounter with the young woman from Varnsdorf.|$|E
500|$|Meaden was {{replaced}} as manager by two filmmakers, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. They {{were looking for}} a young, unsigned rock group that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about, and had seen the band at the Railway Hotel in Wealdstone, which had become a regular venue for them. Lambert related to Townshend and his art school background, and encouraged him to write songs. In August, Lambert and Stamp made a promotional film featuring the group and their audience at the Railway. The band changed their set towards soul, rhythm and blues and Motown covers, and created the slogan [...] "Maximum R".|$|E

50|$|Genelec began {{operations}} {{to meet the}} needs of Finland's national public-broadcasting company YLE. YLE was building a new radio house in Pasila, Helsinki. Juhani Borenius, who worked for YLE as an acoustician, asked his friends at a postgraduate acoustics seminar if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> active monitoring speaker. Ilpo Martikainen and Topi Partanen had the first sample in two weeks. The prototype was promising enough to raise serious interest. In 1978, after two years of research and development, the company opened for business with their first speaker, the S30. The company moved immediately from Helsinki to Iisalmi, in the center of Finland. The first facilities were in Satamakatu, 190 m2 in the basement of an apartment building where Martikainen lived.|$|R
500|$|Displaced {{from their}} home state, the {{legislative}} council dispersed to places where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session. Scant records show that, on December 30, 1862, Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at Athens, Tennessee for a meeting on January 15, 1863. Hawes unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes's former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command. On March 4, he told Davis by letter that [...] "our cause is steadily on the increase" [...] and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt's chief project {{during her}} husband's first two terms was the {{establishment}} of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for [...] "a new kind of community" [...] in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project.|$|E
500|$|Following the Battle of Perryville, the {{provisional}} government left Kentucky {{for the final}} time.

30|$|The {{study was}} {{approved}} by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health, Sport and Science at the University of Glamorgan. General ethical principles in health and social research were applied. Young people were excluded if they did not have the mental capacity to consent. An information sheet with details about the study and participation was provided to potential participants, who were also given an opportunity to raise questions so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> informed decision about participation. Consenting took place at the introductory day and was checked on a regular basis {{to make sure they were}} happy to continue with project activities. Although participation was voluntary, money was given after participants were interviewed, attended a group day or completed a task, to thank them for their time and effort. A free lunch was provided on each group day.|$|R
500|$|In 1993, Field, Cook, and Page {{decided to}} give up {{teaching}} for a year to focus on performing full-time, along with Fatt, to see if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living out of it. [...] As Fatt reported, [...] "it {{was very much a}} cottage industry". [...] They used many of the business techniques developed by The Cockroaches, choosing to remain as independent and self-contained as possible. [...] John Field, Mike Conway, who later became The Wiggles' general manager, trumpeter Dominic Lindsay, and Cockroaches saxophonist Daniel Fallon performed with them. [...] Anthony Field, with input from the other members, did most of the production of their music, DVDs, and live shows. [...] Their act was later augmented with supporting characters: the [...] "friendly pirate" [...] Captain Feathersword and the animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog. These characters were initially performed by the band members themselves: Field played Captain Feathersword and Wags; Cook played Dorothy; and Fatt played Henry. [...] In 1993, actor Paul Paddick, who became known as [...] "the fifth Wiggle" [...] and was as popular as the bandmembers, permanently joined the group to play Captain Feathersword. [...] At first, the group travelled {{with a small group of}} dancers hired from a local dance studio to perform with them.|$|E
500|$|Four muzzle-loading smoothbore [...] guns, {{based on}} the American Rodman design, were {{originally}} intended as Petr Velikys main armament, but the Russians were impressed by a demonstration of a new Krupp [...] rifled gun. They bought a few guns directly {{as well as a}} production license and an enlarged 12-inch, 20-caliber, gun was selected to replace the 20-inch guns. In order to keep the gun ports as small as possible the hydraulic turret machinery raised and lowered the guns' trunnions rather than their muzzles. They had a maximum elevation of +12.5° and a maximum depression of −2.5°. This gave the guns a range of about [...] at maximum elevation. The gun turrets were of the Coles type and weighed [...] each. Powered by steam engines <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> complete 360° rotation in one minute, although they had a firing arc of only 310°. The guns recoiled into the turrets after firing, which meant that a great deal of powder smoke was released into the turret. To counter this problem, ventilation fans were mounted in the turret roofs. The ship's machinery filled almost the entire breastwork, which forced the main gun magazines away from the turrets towards the ends of the ship, and that complicated the ammunition resupply arrangements for those guns. While some shells were stored in the breastwork, most were not, and likely would have slowed the ship's sustained rate of fire in a lengthy engagement.|$|E
500|$|The Coetus Internationalis Patrum did, however, {{manage to}} get the {{preliminary}} vote (with suggestions for modifications) on the document put off until the fourth session of the Council, but were unable to prevent the adoption, on 7 December 1965, of the final text of the declaration Dignitatis humanae by {{the overwhelming majority of}} the Council. The expressed view of some that this overwhelming majority was only due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those prelates who initially had reservations or even objections, however, is not accepted by all observers. Lefebvre was one of those who voted against the declaration, but he was one of those who added their signature to the document, after that of the Pope, though not all present did sign. Lefebvre later declared that the sheet of paper that he signed and that was [...] "passed from hand to hand among the Fathers of the Council and upon which everyone placed his signature, had no meaning of a vote for or against, but signified simply our presence at the meeting to vote for four documents." [...] However, the paper on which his signature appears, and which was not [...] "the relatively unimportant attendance sheet which Lefebvre recalled in his interview", bears [...] "the title Declaratio de Libertate Religiosa (along with the titles of three other documents) at the top," [...] and [...] "(t)he fathers were informed that if they wished to sign one or more documents, but not all of them, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> marginal annotation beside their name, specifying which documents they did or did not wish to sign. No such annotation is found beside the names of either Lefebvre or de Castro Mayer, which proves that they were prepared to share in the official promulgation of that Declaration on Religious Liberty which they later publicly rejected." ...|$|E
