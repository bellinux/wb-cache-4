They may comprise smaller municipalities or other types of administrative divisions, which are generally treated as census subdivisions by Statistics Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{incipient}} Gowa bureaucracy {{was greatly}} expanded by Tunipalangga.

The former sabannaraq Daeng Pametteq {{was promoted to}} become the first tumailalang. Another bureaucratic innovation was the creation of the post or posts of guildmaster or Tumakkajananngang, who supervised the operation of craftsmen's guilds in Makassar and ensured that each guild would yield <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>that</b> the state demanded of them. In tandem with these bureaucratic reforms, centralization continued apace with Tunipalangga remembered as the first to impose heavy corvée duties on his subjects. However, corvee workers continued to be recruited by the landed nobility rather than the emerging bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Schultz stated that {{a series of}} events changed his {{political}} views from the right of the political spectrum to left of the spectrum. One event was his mother's battle with Alzheimer's Disease, which began a long, slow decline of her mental health. Schultz found it frustrating trying to get her <b>the</b> <b>services</b> <b>that</b> she needed. Another was that he met a psychiatric nurse named Wendy who ran a homeless shelter in Fargo, North Dakota. He attributed much of his political change to her. Although he had criticized the homeless on his show, he said in his book that she helped to humanize them and he reportedly found that some of the people he had insulted were veterans, unable to get the psychiatric or medical services that might help them. He says that was the moment he began to look at poverty differently.|$|E
25|$|New {{guidelines}} from library {{organizations such}} as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) and the ALA were written {{in order to help}} libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the Deaf community.

Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.|$|E
