6000|$|... "What you did, of course. That is finished. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> supper party. What happened? Was Dredlinton really rude to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{wonderful}} horse {{you were}} riding yesterday. There cannot be another {{like it in}} the whole world. Where {{did you get it}} from?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the last}} of them,' she said; 'I don't care for it one way or the other. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> cove, who is he?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you think}} I shall ever forget your {{preferences}} and dislikings? Do you recollect <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> blue scarf of mine, that I should never wear blue?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thyme {{has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> poor little thing. It seems so dreadful, and I can't {{get rid of}} the feeling that we're--we're all mixed up with it!" ...|$|R
60|$|First Friar. Colman was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> He {{gives them}} a joyful thought to fix their minds on. They must not let their minds stray to {{anything}} else. They must follow that single thought and put everything else behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, don't!" [...] {{interrupted}} {{his sister}} wearily; [...] "yer allus doin' it. Jest <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> young man--the new clerk ye think o' gettin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Majesty, it {{was good}} of you to come. I'm all broken up. How did you ever do it? But never mind that now. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> brother of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Jantje. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stick--that long {{stick with}} a knob at the top, and the nicks cut on it. Has it not {{something}} to do with Frank Muller?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] he said, [...] "that your {{troubles}} with us {{will soon be}} over. Eve has been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> young idiot of an Englishman who visited the Bundercombes out in Okata. If there was one man whose name I thought I was safe {{to make use of}} it was Joe Bundercombe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The consul smiled. [...] "Ah, then, I {{hope you}} can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>THAT,</b> for I really don't know whether he has established his claim or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't need to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{part of your}} career," [...] she interrupted, with {{a little}} smile almost of proprietory pride. [...] "I never forget it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are quite}} near, now. I {{wish you would}} open your heart to me, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> great trouble, Nora. I {{might be able to}} comfort you in some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, dolly, you may <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> in due time, but let's {{stick to}} this social {{problem for a}} moment. Do you {{think you ought to}} be too {{intimate}} with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{effected}} your {{escape from}} Spielberg!" [...] the count repeated, in surprise. [...] "That {{is indeed a}} notable feat, for {{it is one of}} our strongest prisons; but you shall <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> presently.|$|E
6000|$|... "May his father's curse blisther him then! May--but I {{think they}} wor <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> before. Eh, Feemy?" [...] he continued, with a sigh, [...] "it's {{a bad time}} I've been having of it with this tipsy woman since you were gone; she don't lave me a moment's pace from morning to night; bad 'cess to her, but I wish she wor well out of the house. I'll have you to mind me now--and you'll not be bawling and shaking me as she does; but she's always dhrunk," [...] he added in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to force}} your {{confidence}} by a hair," [...] said Father Brown, very quietly. [...] "But I {{think you could}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>that</b> than I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know you," [...] responded the ranger. [...] "You're that rancher I saw {{working in}} the ditch the day I went to telephone, and you've come to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you {{had better}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> matter of {{business}} next time I am here," [...] he suggested, with an abruptness which was almost brusque. [...] "I must go now. I {{do not know why}} I have stayed so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{made up my}} mind {{to chuck}} my work and live down here. I want you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> cottage you spoke of. However, I suppose there'll be no {{difficulty}} about getting a cottage, will there?" [...] He spoke with an assumption of carelessness as if expecting her to dissuade him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha! Every man to {{his right}} place at last. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> for it will amuse me. I have heard naught of him since he sent the king his Hereford thralls' arms and legs in the pickle-barrels; to show him, he said, that {{there was plenty of}} cold meat on his royal demesnes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nuthin' <b>about</b> <b>that</b> boy! Didn't I {{catch him}} stealin' my choicest pears last summer? If he comes around my place again, I'll fill him full of shot, see if I don't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a selfish}} pig I am!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Anyhow, it's all over now. We'll {{go back to}} Luigi's to supper, by all means. I am {{going to make you}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> young man from Bath!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't think <b>that.</b> Straight. Please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> New York. <b>That's</b> the place, all right. Jiminy! wouldn't I {{like to go}} there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} were delightfully lucid," [...] she said. [...] "I quite understood, and on the whole I think I agree with you. I don't think that the sentimental side of me has been {{properly}} developed. By the bye, {{you were going to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> pretty girl I saw at Enton--Lady Caroom's daughter, wasn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I {{could see}} where that dear little black chamois horn came from! But Mother Bunch can't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> I'm afraid, for she always went by sea, and here's the Tyrol without one bit of sea near it. It's {{just one of the}} strings to the great knot of {{mountains}} that tie Europe up in the middle. Oh! what is a mountain like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very," [...] I {{said in a}} mildly {{sympathetic}} tone, {{and he went on}} to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{business of}} the Bonham drain. Things of that kind, I observe, are apt to weigh on the minds of Medical Officers of Health. I was as sympathetic as I knew how, and when he called the Bonham people [...] "asses," [...] I said they were [...] "thundering asses," [...] but even that did not allay him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] she said, [...] "be {{quiet and}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the world; <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{everything}} <b>that's</b> ever happened, and I'll <b>tell</b> you--let <b>me</b> see, what can I tell you?--I'll {{tell you about}} Miss Montgomerie and the river party. She was left, you see, with {{one foot in the}} boat, and the other on shore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beth is asleep. Speak low, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it. <b>That</b> Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" [...] asked Mrs. March rather sharply.|$|R
6000|$|The gentlemen {{left the}} dining-room with the ladies, in the Continental manner. Lady St. Jerome, who was {{leaning on the}} arm of the monsignore, guided him into a saloon farther than the one they had reentered, and then seating herself said, [...] "You were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Scotland, <b>that</b> you {{yourself}} thought it ripe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The place he's {{been living}} at is Paris," [...] said Humphrey, [...] "and {{they tell me}} 'tis where the king's head was cut off years ago. My poor mother used to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> business. 'Hummy,' she used to say, 'I was a young maid then, and as I was at home ironing mother's caps one {{afternoon}} the parson came in and said, [...] "They've cut the king's head off, Jane; and what 'twill be next God knows."'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{examination}} proceeded uninterruptedly {{until it}} had reached that point in the progress of events at which Anne had crushed Geoffrey Delamayn's letter in her hand, and had thrown it from her indignantly {{to the other end}} of the room. There, for the first time, Sir Patrick dipped his pen in the ink, apparently intending to take a note. [...] "Be very careful here," [...] he said; [...] "I want to know every thing that you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what do you}} want? Oh, hello Dave; what do you want? Which Morgenroth's? Adolph's? All right. Amputation? Yuh, I see. Say, Dave, get Gus {{to harness}} up and take my {{surgical}} kit down there--and have him take some chloroform. I'll go straight down from here. May not get home tonight. You can get me at Adolph's. Huh? No, Carrie can give the anesthetic, I guess. G'-by. Huh? No; <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> tomorrow--too damn many people always listening in on this farmers' line." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{certainly}} as yet {{did not understand}} it. It {{had never occurred to}} him that she would know what were his father's wishes. Perhaps he was slow of comprehension as he urged her to tell him what this was about his father. [...] "What can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him, <b>that</b> I should not like to hear?" ...|$|R
60|$|Harry (Scornfully). Owns both them rabbit hutches, does he? Just a thing he'd {{be proud}} of... (Earnest.) And now {{you had better}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>that</b> chap who's coming to-morrow. Know {{anything}} of him? I reckon there's {{more than one in}} that little game. Come! Out with it! (Chaffing.) I don't take no... from women.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] Barton admitted, [...] "that I'm {{so taken}} by {{surprise}} I hardly know where I am! I do think, if I may say so without seeming conceited, that I {{have every reason to}} be happy. But, just as she was beginning to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> herself, <b>that</b> young lady, who seems to have known her at school, rushed in and explained the whole mystery." ...|$|R
