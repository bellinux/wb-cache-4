5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
5|$|Estimated {{numbers of}} Calusa at the {{beginning}} of the Spanish occupation ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society declined in power and population; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the Yamasee to the north. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Soon they were relocated again to the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes' initial {{response}} to the declaration of war was diplomatic; <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, {{but was unable to}} sway the city's war-weary population.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} East–West shipping lane in the Baltic Sea passed the Hiiu sandbank. Already {{before the year}} 1490 the Hanseatic merchants were seeking permission to mark this peninsula with an outstanding landmark. Around 1490 <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> bishop of Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek to let them build a landmark on the Kõpu peninsula which was under the bishop’s control. This action had no real results.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed {{it could be used}} as an air force base—and thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> company to cease operations, then asked the American military to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans. The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.|$|E

5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The lead-up to {{the match}} was controversial. The All Blacks' manager George Dixon and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) {{could not agree}} on a referee. Dixon {{rejected}} all of the WRU's proposed referees, and the WRU all of Dixon's. The rules of the day dictated that {{in such a case}} the WRU could ask another union to appoint a referee. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Scotland Rugby Union, who appointed Scotsman John Dallas. As well as the referee, the selection of Mynott at first five-eighth over Billy Stead was highly controversial. Several explanations were given for Stead's omission. One was that he was originally selected, but gave up his spot in the team for a disappointed Mynott. The official reason given for Stead's omission was injury—although he was fit enough to act as touch judge during the Test.|$|E
5|$|For the 1579 campaign, Farnese planned two {{different}} movements. A {{portion of his}} army, under Cristóbal de Mondragón, was to clean the area between Maastricht and the German border from Dutch garrisons, while Farnese himself, ahead of the main army, decided to move against Antwerp with two objectives: to neutralize the Dutch field army, or primarily its German cavalry, before laying siege to Maastricht and to distract the Dutch from the campaign's real objective. The {{first part of the}} plan was accomplished when Mondragón took the towns of Kerpen, Erkelenz and Straelen between 7 and 15 January. On 24 January, Farnese moved to attack the States General army, which was at Weert, east of Antwerp. Outnumbered, François de la Noue, who had taken to role of field commander of the States' army after the Count of Bossu's death, left some States' troops in the Castle of Weert and withdrew to Antwerp with his unpaid men. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> city council to allow them to enter the city, but it was refused, and De la Noue {{had no choice but to}} entrench his army outside the walls, in the village of Borgerhout. This was a residential area for the wealthy inhabitants of Antwerp where they had country houses and gardens, among them Peeter van Coudenberghe's botanical garden, which had more than 600 exotic plants.|$|E

5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that the pitcher was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> umpire to search the pitcher. Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed with the program and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. <b>They</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|Marco knew four languages, and {{the family}} had {{accumulated}} {{a great deal of}} knowledge and experience that was useful to Kublai. It is possible that he became a government official; he wrote about many imperial visits to China's southern and eastern provinces, the far south and Burma. They were highly respected and sought after in the Mongolian court, and so Kublai Khan decided to decline the Polos' requests to leave China. They became worried about returning home safely, believing that if Kublai died, his enemies might turn against them because of their close involvement with the ruler. In 1292, Kublai's great-nephew, then ruler of Persia, sent representatives to China in search of a potential wife, and <b>they</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Polos to accompany them, so they were permitted to return to Persia with the wedding party—which left that same year from Zaitun in southern China on a fleet of 14 junks. The party sailed to the port of Singapore, travelled north to Sumatra, and sailed west to the Point Pedro port of Jaffna under Savakanmaindan and to Pandyan of Tamilakkam. Eventually Polo crossed the Arabian Sea to Hormuz. The two-year voyage was a perilous one—of the six hundred people (not including the crew) in the convoy only eighteen had survived (including all three Polos). The Polos left the wedding party after reaching Hormuz and travelled overland to the port of Trebizond on the Black Sea, the present day Trabzon.|$|E
