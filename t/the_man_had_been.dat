25|$|Before Hildegard's death, {{a problem}} arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted {{to remove his}} body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, {{replying}} {{that it was a}} sin and that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reconciled to the church {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

25|$|In its wake, several Jews {{were seriously}} injured and one Orthodox Jewish man was killed. Two {{weeks after the}} riot, a non-Jewish man {{was killed by a}} group of black men; some {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mistaken for a Jew. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor David Dinkins, an African American, who was blamed for an ineffective police response.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 police shot {{a man in}} his {{own home}} in front of his wife in a town called Husby. The police said <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{wielding}} and threatening them with a machete. The Stockholm riots, where more than 100 cars were torched, were set off after the Husby shooting. When the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. People said the police called them 'monkeys' and used batons against them in the clash.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1997, {{at around}} 4.30 pm, a sixteen-year-old boy {{discovered}} {{the body of}} a man, lying face down, at the base of an old water tower in Keillers Park, in downtown GÃ¶teborg. Called on site, the police determined that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot twice with a pistol. The first bullet hit him in the back and went right through the heart, while the second was fired to his head as he lay on the ground. A bag and a head cap were recovered beside the body.|$|E

25|$|A search {{concluded}} that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from the suitcase was that since a coat in the suitcase had a front gusset and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the body work is done when the owner is fitted before it is completed. The coat had not been imported, indicating <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.|$|E
25|$|As strike-related {{violence}} mounted, Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons {{called in}} the Colorado National Guard on October 28. At first, the Guard's appearance calmed the situation, but the sympathies of Guard leaders lay with company management. Guard Adjutant-General John Chase, who had served during the violent Cripple Creek strike 10 years earlier, imposed a harsh regime. On March 10, 1914, {{the body of a}} replacement worker was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes, Colorado. The National Guard said that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered by the strikers. In retaliation, Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed. The attack was launched while the inhabitants were attending a funeral of two infants who had died a few days earlier. The attack was witnessed by photographer Lou Dold, whose images of the destruction appear often in accounts of the strike.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, archaeologists {{discovered}} at Giv'at ha-Mivtar in northeast Jerusalem {{the remains of}} one Jehohanan, who had been crucified in the 1st century. The remains included a heel bone with a nail driven through it from the side. The tip of the nail was bent, perhaps because of striking a knot in the upright beam, which prevented it being extracted from the foot. A first inaccurate account {{of the length of}} the nail led some to believe that it had been driven through both heels, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> placed in a sort of sidesaddle position, but the true length of the nail, 11.5cm (4.53inches), suggests instead that in this case of crucifixion the heels were nailed to opposite sides of the upright. The skeleton from Giv'at ha-Mivtar is currently the only recovered example of ancient crucifixion in the archaeological record.|$|E

60|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{cut with}} knives, but the blows <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given so hurriedly {{that no one}} was seriously injured. Twelve <b>men</b> lay on <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
25|$|The {{remains were}} found accidentally in an ossuary with the crucified man's name on it, 'Jehohanan, {{the son of}} Hagakol'. Nicu Haas, an {{anthropologist}} at the Hebrew University Medical School in Jerusalem, examined the ossuary and discovered that it contained a heel bone with a nail driven through its side, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> crucified. The position of the nail relative to the bone indicates that the feet had been nailed to the cross from their side, not from their front; various opinions have been proposed {{as to whether they}} were both nailed together {{to the front of the}} cross or one on the left side, one on the right side. The point of the nail had olive wood fragments on it indicating that he was crucified on a cross made of olive wood or on an olive tree. Since olive trees are not very tall, this would suggest that the condemned was crucified at eye level.|$|E
25|$|On , {{the body}} of 20-year-old DeAndre Joshua was found inside a parked car within a few blocks of where Brown was killed. Police {{initially}} classified the death as suspicious, later ruling it a homicide. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{shot in the head}} and burned. That same day, CNN reported that thousands of people rallied to protest the grand jury's decision in more than 170 U.S. cities from Boston to Los Angeles, and that National Guard forces were reinforced at Ferguson to prevent the situation from escalating. At least 90 people were arrested for arson, looting, and vandalism in Oakland, California. Protests also took place internationally, with demonstrations held in several major cities in Canada and in London, United Kingdom. Calls by protesters to disrupt the Black Friday shopping day, which took place the Friday after the grand jury decision, were heeded in the St. Louis region, with hundreds of demonstrators blocking walkways and shouting slogans at the Saint Louis Galleria and other area shopping centers.|$|E
500|$|On April 18, in a {{trail of}} {{evidence}} stretching several hundred yards down a McAllen road, passersby found Garza's purse, her left shoe and her lace veil. Authorities and volunteers started a search that was the largest in Rio Grande Valley history at that time. A woman called the Garza home claiming to be Irene, saying {{that she had been}} kidnapped and taken to a hotel in nearby Hidalgo, but the call was found to have been a prank. Another person told an Edinburg waitress that he had killed Garza, but that was found to be a joke made after <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> drinking heavily.|$|E

500|$|In China, {{up to one}} {{thousand}} members of the Christian cult Almighty God were arrested after claiming {{that the end of}} b'ak'tun 13 marked the end of the world, and {{that it was time to}} overthrow Communism. Shoppers were reported to be hoarding supplies of candles in anticipation of coming darkness, while online retailer Taobao sold tickets to board Noah's Ark to customers. Bookings for wedding ceremonies on 21 December 2012 were saturated in several cities. On 14 December 2012, a man in Henan province attacked and wounded twenty-three children with a knife. Authorities suspected <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> [...] "influenced" [...] by the prediction of the upcoming apocalypse. Academics in China attributed the widespread belief in the 2012 doomsday in their country to a lack of scientific literacy and a mistrust of the government-controlled media.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} casting Hirsch, Ioan Gruffudd was cast as Dr. Henry Morgan. [...] Miller wanted the actors {{to read the}} script {{so that he could}} see whether the {{audience}} would believe that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> alive for over 200 years. The search for an actor to portray Henry was more difficult than Miller expected. [...] Miller and Fiorentino unsuccessfully auditioned actors from New York City, Los Angeles, Canada, London, Australia, and South Africa for the role, but the role was uncast. One day, Miller noticed Gruffudd in the carpool lane while they picked up their children from preschool. [...] For Miller, Gruffudd's period work, such as in the series Horatio Hornblower, made him an obvious selection for the role. [...] Gruffudd liked the script and felt that he could portray Henry. [...] The story, the science fiction element, and the believability also attracted Gruffudd to the role.|$|E
500|$|At around 8:30 AM on September 20, {{a man was}} presumed {{drowned in}} Lake Catouatchie, {{southwest}} of New Orleans. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shrimping in the lake in choppy waters caused by the storm, and dove into the water without a life vest to untangle a net from his boat's propeller. [...] After he freed the propeller, the boat was carried away by the current in the lake, and he was last seen swimming after the boat. [...] After the disappearance, the Coast Guard launched a search with rescue boats and search dogs but could not locate him. His body was eventually found {{on the morning of}} September 22. Captain Pat Yoes, of the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office, said that the storm [...] "obviously... played a part" [...] in the man's death, but Lieutenant Commander William Brewer of the United States Coast Guard told the press that he did not [...] "think it was directly storm-related." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1949, Stackpole {{moved to}} Chauriat in the Puy-de-DÃ´me area of central France, {{returning}} {{with his second}} wife Ginette to her birthplace. There, his art became less figurative and more abstract, both in sculpture and in painting. He kept a flow of correspondence with his old friends in San Francisco, including Helen Salz, who described his letters as devoid of any mention of sculpture or painting, or any project that Stackpole might have been working onâinstead, he wrote of musicians and music, and of his encounters with people. Salz bought a Stackpole bust of poet George Sterling and donated it to the University of California in 1955â56, to be displayed in Dwinelle Hall. In early 1964, Stackpole visited San Francisco to see his family, and he called up his old friend Kenneth Rexroth. In his San Francisco Examiner newspaper column, Rexroth wrote of having lunch with the Stackpole family, and reminded his readers that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> known [...] "for 20 years or more [...] San Francisco's leading artist." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{radiocarbon}} datings to {{find the}} age of the bones suggested dates of 1430â60 and 1412â49âboth too early for Richard's death in 1485. Mass spectrometry carried out on the bones found evidence of much seafood consumption, which is known to make radiocarbon dating samples appear older than they are. [...] A Bayesian analysis suggested there was a 68.2% probability that the true date of the bones was between 1475 and 1530, rising to 95.4% for between 1450 and 1540. Although by itself not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard's, it was consistent with the date of his death. The mass spectrometry result indicating the rich seafood diet was confirmed by a chemical isotope analysis of two teeth, a femur and a rib. From the isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the teeth and bones the researchers discovered the diet included much freshwater fish and exotic birds such as swan, crane and heron, and a vast quantity of wineâ all items at {{the high end of the}} luxury market. Close analysis of the soil immediately below the skeleton revealed that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> infested with roundworm parasites when he died.|$|E
