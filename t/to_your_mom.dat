Today {{was a rather}} “blue day” for me cause I guess I didn’t have enough planned things to do. Of course, being without you can make me blue anytime, but Bubsie, I wish I knew more younger people around Cleve., altho’ I still can’t figure out where I’d get the {{time to spend with}} them. I mean I’d like to take [sic] with someone in the “same boat” as I’m in. Know what I mean? So far, outside of Amy I haven’t met a sould [sic] who really is in a similar perdicament [sic] to mine, 2 ̆ 6 then, Amy was in the WACS before marriage 2 ̆ 6 didn’t have the adjustment to make that I did. But—don’t worry, dear. I’ll survive until you come home [...] 2 ̆ 6 for the present, I’m as happy as can be expected. Spoke <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>Mom</b> 2 ̆ 6 Sanf today. Sanf 2 ̆ 6 I talked for about 30 minutes about a million different things. I still think he lacks certain social graces and he definitely cannot adjust to different classes 2 ̆ 6 ages of people the way you can. You are definitely very adaptable to people if you want to be. Honey, I really feel you could be a great statesman, if that would be your desire. I finished reading “Your Car Was Made to Last. ” I got nothing out of the technical chapter, but the chapter on “Etiquette in a Garage 2 ̆ 6 Service Station” was Cleve besides being information. If I got [sic] ambitious during the week, I’ll quote some stuff to you. However, one thing I remember very vividly is “if a put a boat in, but have it valcanized. ” Guess we should have read the book a long time ago. It has definitely straightened me out on some points about the car, itself 2 ̆ 6 how to drive it. UK 2 ̆ 6 I had dinner at Chin’s—I thought it was my party 2 ̆ 6 was I surprised when UK beat me to the bill! Sadie 2 ̆ 6 Max have been literally begging me to see “Wilson” with them, so UK 2 ̆ 6 I met them at the Keiths. I thought the picture excellent as a whole. However, it had a few minor flaws— 2 nd wife looked too young—picture forgot that as death drew near, he was paralyzed on left side, etc. ! However, it gave a clear picture of a sincere, idealistic, rather stubborn man who was born “ 30 years too soon. ” I thought I’d send you another cablegram, but I think I’ll wait 2 ̆ 6 find out how soon you rec’d the first one.

However, I still can’t help but wish for quicker service! As yet, I haven’t rec’d your money order or package, but guess it’ll be around eventually. Sure hope my camera has finally reached you as I know I sent it {{the day you}} left the states. I rec’d a letter from Lt. Amster—I’ll forward it to {{you as soon as}} I answer it. It was a very cute letter 2 ̆ 6 did cheer me up—whether it was or wasn’t meant to cheer me up, I don’t know—but, it did! Also, heard from the Bjorkmans who said they heard from you. Gee honey, you should be getting mail from lots of our friends. Heard from Mort today 2 ̆ 6 he feels fairly certain that he won’t be in the states for Xmas. But—our family is rather used to having our loved ones {{dispersed}} around the world. When I awoke this morning I had a slight cold, but what can you expect from living in a climate like this—snow 2 ̆ 6 wind-nuts! So—I start to drive the car—ooph—battery dead! Dad 2 ̆ 6 I pushed the car out of the garage 2 ̆ 6 then he pushed me with his car 2 ̆ 6 I got started. My battery is now being re-charged, oh shucks! I figured up our budget for Nov. 2 ̆ 6 the darn car is what made the budget so high. Honey, I balanced it by just adding it once—pretty nifty—huh? I figured you spent 85. 30 this month plus some stuff I bought (toiletries) to send you eventually [...] 86. 46.

40|$|Transcription begins] September 25, 1944 Monday night My {{precious}} darling, Today I {{received two}} letters from you mailed 9 / 24 —gosh, was I surprised and pleased! I’m {{so glad you}} write me often, darling, as your letters certainly keep my morale A- 1. When I first saw your letters I thought you had time to visit Helen and I was sort of, kind of peeved, because then, I would have “kicked myself” for not contending with her cockroaches {{for a week or}} so, and then, getting a chance to see you again. But seriously, darling, I’m kind of glad I’m home. I would have hated another anti-climax. When you called me on the phone and told me all the news, I immediately called your folks and mine and told them the news. We are both “blabber mouths,” I’m sorry to say. This, however, has taught me a lesson (I can see where I should repeat nothing) and from now on, I don’t open my mouth! Now, please don’t write me anything confidential, or tell me anything confidential, as it seems I have a “wagging tongue. ” After your letter said everything was to be confidential and I already spilled the beans, I was so angry with myself, I could have cried, because I’m so dumb. I know it’s all insignificant and not at all authorative [sic] or informative, but still—! I’ll send you a subscription to Coronet just as soon as I can get to gi [sic]. And also, just as soon as I can think of another person that might enjoy it—maybe even myself???? Tomorrow morning, a 3 cent letter, plus a V-mail will be mailed the same time as this letter. Let me know the timong [sic] on them. We heard from Al Altman and his wife today. Al is up for a medical discharge and he plans to accept it. Also, Martha is not positive, but she thinks she’s pregnant. Also, we hear from the Hamburgs, and Sima is still looking for an ap’t., and now she is again planning to quit her job! Also, Sonny Krasik got a job at the air field. And, the town is literally empty, but Sima can’t find an ap’t. —ha, ha! So that’s all the news I know of friends so far. Now, let’s see what happened with me today. Oh, yes, I saw Mrs. Lang at the Bd. of Ed. This morning, and I have a job starting Oct. 2 nd at $ 130. 00 every four weeks. Here’s the dope: I’m going back to my same job at Glenville Day Care Center, but if I had stuck with the job since last year, I could have been making $ 160. 00 every four weeks, because they gave every girl one year credit for work before the act came into effect and that was worth $ 10. and then, you get a $ 5. raise every 6 mos. of continuous service. Anyhow, they wouldn’t give me any credit for my work out of the state. So I decided to take the job at $ 130., as they are paying me to go to a week’s schooling and then, I get [a]$ 5. 00 raise every 6 mos., plus 15 days sick leave a year, plus one week paid vacation every six months, or, that can be accumulated. Also, I work only a 44 hr. week, so I really don’t that [sic] too bad! I had to get a temporary teacher’s certificate which costs a dollar and also, I have to go have a physical examine [sic]. After I get done with my interview, I went to WRU in the hopes of taking 9 hrs. [o]f educ. work this quarter, and 9 hrs. of education courses next semester, and that would entitle me to a permanent teacher’s certificate, but damn, all the courses I need are offered during the day time. Ah, heck, I can get along without a permanent certificate. After that I went to the Office of Civilian Defense and I wanted to sign up for USO work and also, sign Sanf up. Well, there are at least 50 people on the waiting list for an interview, but I talked to [sic] the secretary into giving me an app’t for tomorrow. You see, her husband was a major at Fort Sill before he died, and her son is a F. A. man in the S. Pacific, so you can well see how I maneuvered it. Anyhow, we got very conficential [sic], and she said, that you can’t do much in USO work in Cleveland as they have too many volunteers all wanting USO work, because that’s patriotic, but she asked why I didn’t do settlement work. Well, I got very interested and learned there was a terrific need in Cleveland for such. Anyhow, Sanf and I can work at the colored project on Woodland with adults or adolescents, or we can start with organization and help with organizing one at Hough Ave. and 71 st—Thomas Edison School. Sanf and I both like the latter best as we can get in on the ground floor. As soon as we have definite plans made, I’ll write you. Also, I’m going to start going to Sidney Hill reducing clinic as soon as I get all of the above settled. However, since I’ve been home I’ve lost 5 lbs. from just running around and not using the car, although the darn thing still runs plenty good! Spoke <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>Mom</b> today—nothing new! Shall probably see them some time this week, although I’m still at a loss as to what to say and do when I’m there! Enclosed find samples of the material I’m using in our ap’t. I think the material is not too feminine, because after all, I still dream you’re in bed with me, and some day you actually will be. I used the oil cloth material to top the dressing table, and the top of the pillow on the stool and also, to cover the lamp shade. The other material (by the way, that’s the complete pattern and then, it repeats itself) I have used horizontally, vertically and diagonally. It really looks very attractive! Let me know if the censor lets it through. I {{spend a lot of time}} in the ap’t and I give the folks $ 10. week, which, darn them I know they put in war bonds for us. But anyhow, I feel better giving them the money. Oh yes, I, also, spend a lot of time upstairs as I get a little disgus [sic] hearing the family quarrels, especially between my mother and Sadie. But, that’s the way it goes. I love you madly, and count every minute you’re away as useless—time only matters when I’m with you, and then I forget it. All my love forever, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins]:Wednesday Dearest Judson, Honey, I {{really should}} be {{addressing}} my Christmas cards now but you’re {{much more important than}} any old cards. Well, honey, first of all I have a lot to tell you. To begin at the beginning—I woke up at some ungodly hour of the morning. Oh, I just remembered something—censored [word crossed out underneath] Had the funniest dream last night. The only thing I can remember is that you and I were sailing someplace. It was a huge boat and we were having a marvelous time. Can’t remember any more. Well, that’s beside the point. Anyhoo—I got up this morning and slid to the doctors. Golly, it was so cold and slippery. I’ll bet you’re freezing to pieces up there. Stewart is so cold. They have the nicest tropical breezes blowing gently up there all the time—like at the Air Show. Well, first of all I had to wait half an hour to see the doctor. Some little boy had bashed his finger in the car and he was screaming {{at the top of his}} lungs. Well, the doctor gave my ankle a treatment. That took ages because the phone kept ringing and he had to run and answer it every few seconds. Then he started the examination—He scared me half to death because he kept frowning about everything. Well, you now are engaged to “death warmed over”—I might as well just give up trying to live. Wait til you hear all the things that I have wrong with me. Well, first of all I have low blood pressure. He said that wasn’t too bad because what may be low for one person may be quite all right for someone else. And guess what. Have you ever seen those ads where a girl is sitting looking very unhappy while another couple are laughing gaily in the background (not a Mum ad). Well, the girl it seems has borderline anemia. Well, guess who else has it—me. Can you imagine me anemic? Is that spelled right? Anyway he said it wasn’t bad. Something about hemogoblin [sic] in the blood. I’m 75 or something like that and normal is supposed to be 80. Borderline is between 70 and 80. Oh, well, that’s not all. This I knew about. I also have infected tonsils. He wants them out almost immediately. Probably after the first of the year. Before this epidemic of infantile it was considered best to be operated on in the warm weather but now cold weather is the best. The only danger is catching cold but that is much less a danger than getting infantile. So, probably as soon as you leave for advanced I’ll go and have them taken out. Well, hone, that’s about it. Have to gargle three times a day because my throat is red 2 ̆ 6 inflamed and they can’t operate until that goes away. Then I have to take care of my ankle and take those old iron pills and vitamins every day, too. Lord, I’m a walking drug store. Can you imagine me being anemic? That really struck me funny. It really isn’t a laughing matter but it did seem ridiculous. Honestly, I’m really a wreck. Well, outside of all those things I’m perfectly healthy. He didn’t give me a complete examination but he’s going to complete it when his nurse comes back. Lord, I started this two hours ago 2 ̆ 6 in the past two hours I’ve been talking <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>Mom</b> 2 ̆ 6 Woody. Golly, I haven’t told you that I love you at at [sic] in this letter. Setting a new record. Well, honey, it’s about time—I love you so. And miss you terribly. Honey, I’d better get started addressing Christmas cards now or they’ll never get there before Christmas. Woody is sorta mad because Steve hasn’t written yet. You should hear the excuses I’ve been making up for Steve. He should appreciate me more. Woody doesn’t understand why he hasn’t written 2 ̆ 6 I’m trying to explain how busy he probably is 2 ̆ 6 that he probably has already written 2 ̆ 6 that she’ll get a letter from him tomorrow. Write more later. This turned out to be quite a book, huh? Gee, honey, I got your letter before and it was marvelous to hear from you. I miss you so much and a letter from you is so wonderful. You can’t imagine how good your letters make me feel. Now that I practically have one foot in the grave you’d better keep writing a lot. Well, my darling, I really have to address those cards now or people will never get them before Christmas. I love you, hon. So far I’ve only addressed a third of them 2 ̆ 6 there are still millions more to go. This is really sad. Think that I just should give up. Can’t find anyone’s address. Honestly, honey, I never get around to doing anything that I plan. There were a million and one things that I should have gotten done today but didn’t do one thing except get Daddy’s presents for mother. I’ll have to get a job real soon. Been spending money like crazy lately. Just addressed a few more cards. It’s getting worse. Can’t remember who I should send cards to 2 ̆ 6 where they live. More fun. Gee, honey, it’s Wednesday and maybe you’ll be home day after tomorrow. I sure hope so anyway. It will be wonderful to be able to spend a few days with you. I hope we will be together for a couple of days but you never can tell about the Army. Honey, I love you so. Wish you were here now. It’s sorta cold now 2 ̆ 6 you’d be so nice to get warm with. You’re always so nice 2 ̆ 6 warm. My feet are awfully cold. If the old ankle doesn’t get any better by next Tuesday or Wednesday I have to have an exray [sic]. Hope it does. He doesn’t think it’s too bad because it doesn’t hurt me at all—oh, well. That’s nothing to worry about. Golly, this is some letter. Well, I enjoy writing when it’s to you, honey. I’d much rather see you but that’s beside the point. Honey, you just called. Golly, when the operator said Newburgh calling I was so scared. I was sure something was wrong. It was so wonderful to hear your voice, honey. Gee, I love you so. You sounded so happy, darling. Gee, I’m so excited about your getting that delay. That’s really wonderful. I sure am glad to hear that you’ll be home. Golly, honey, it’s so long since I’ve seen you really. Poor Woody—what a situation. I’m so glad that you 2 ̆ 6 I are all engaged and not wondering what’s going to happen next. Honey, the darned telephone has been ringing all evening. Every time I begin to write you it ring[s] 2 ̆ 6 I still haven’t finished addressing those cards. Gee, honey, I love you so. You’re so wonderful and sweet and thoughtful. I love you. Honey, I just couldn’t miss you any more or love you any more. Yet every weekend I love you more 2 ̆ 6 more. Steve told Woody that he might get off on Thursday or all day Friday. I sure wish you’d have all day Friday off. Golly, honey, I hope that we have a white Christmas too. That would just about make it complete. Oh, well, I’ll be happy, honey, if you’re with me. Don’t care what it does. Gee, I hope that wherever you go it won’t be too far away. How long does it take for anyone to go from here to Georgia? Honey, I’d love to go horseback riding. No matter how cold it is. I love riding. I’m afraid that they haven’t any two seaters with radio 2 ̆ 6 heaters. That would be nice. Yes, darling, I am going to wait until after Christmas to get my job. If you’re home do you think I’d be working any place while there was a chance to see you, honey[?] Don’t be silly. No, I’ll wait until you leave and have my tonsils taken out and then get a job after that. Darling, I love you so. Gee, I hate to be away from you. Have to go to New York again tomorrow and I’m certainly not looking forward toward it. Gee, I love you so much. My darling, I’ll be so happy when you 2 ̆ 6 I can be together and not have to be separated. I love you so. Thanks loads for giving Ruth the 2. 00 that she gave me. I’ll give it to you this weekend. Darling, I’d better stop writing because it’s getting awfully late. This sure turned out to be a real letter, didn’t it? Hope that you can read it—The way I’m scribbling, you probably can’t. Well, honey, please write as often as you can. Just a few more days—Two, I hope, and we’ll be together. Gee, that will be wonderful. I love you so. I told you that Ace may be home Saturday. Oh, well, I suppose we can walk. It’s about time. This certainly wasn’t a good time for me to hurt my ankle was it. Well, honey, I love you so. Please get home as soon as you can. Guess you will. Can’t find an envelope to match. Hope you don’t get color blind from this combination. I love you so. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
