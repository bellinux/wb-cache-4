40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} a paradigm shift in Initial Science Teacher Education in Pakistan, which places emphasis {{on the use of}} inquiry-based pedagogy as a key method for improving student-teachers’ understanding of science. In the light of this key role for inquiry-based pedagogy, this study explores the perceptions of <b>teacher-educators</b> and student-teachers who are participating in an initial teacher education (ITE) program in a university in Pakistan. The main aims of the study are to explore (a) their perceptions about the components for inquiry-based pedagogy which are required to be undertaken properly in the classroom; (b) their perceptions of the role and importance of inquiry-based pedagogy and (c) their perceptions of the barriers that impede the practice of inquiry-based approaches. The study uses a methodological triangulation to gather data from science <b>teacher-educators</b> and student-teachers, employing four research tools: a teacher-educators’ questionnaire, a student-teachers’ questionnaire, semi-structured interviews with 20 science <b>teacher-educators,</b> and two focus groups with small groups of science student-teachers. Though, the researcher’s role as an insider helped in collecting robust and extensive data due to a personal familiarity with the native setting, it also brought challenges in conducting the teacher-educators’ interviews. The analysis of data from both <b>teacher-educators</b> and student-teachers converged on the overarching themes of the role of inquiry-based pedagogy in ITE, the relationship between inquiry and science literacy and the barriers impeding the practice of inquiry-based pedagogy. Overall, {{it became clear that the}} conceptualization of inquiry-based learning with <b>teacher-educators</b> and student-teachers was rather limited. Nonetheless, the results of this study indicate that most <b>teacher-educators</b> were positive about the role and importance of inquiry-based pedagogy in ITE. The majority of <b>teacher-educators</b> appreciated their role as a facilitator of the learning process using inquiry and reported that they had developed an appreciation of the benefits of teaching science using inquiry-based pedagogy. Furthermore, <b>teacher-educators</b> strongly indicated an intention to use inquiry-based science teaching strategies in ITE in science though they tended to rely on questions as their main activity rather than using a range of inquiry-based instructional strategies. Moreover, the majority of <b>teacher-educators</b> reported that continued practice in teaching science courses and/or teaching method courses had contributed to their developing a fair understanding of inquiry-based pedagogy in science. The <b>teacher-educators</b> and student-teachers appreciated that inquiry-based pedagogy should be used in ITE because it helps in developing learning. The <b>teacher-educators</b> responded positively regarding the role of inquiry in developing science literacy and in enhancing the procedural understanding of student-teachers in science. Though most of the findings were supported by student-teachers’ responses from student-teachers’ questionnaires and focus groups, a gap was noted between the teacher-educators’ perceptions of the use of inquiry-base pedagogies and the student-teachers’ perceptions of their actual experiences in the science classroom in the responses given in the student-teachers’ focus groups. The results indicate that a majority of <b>teacher-educators</b> and students reported several serious barriers to using inquiry-based pedagogy. These were exam-based assessment, text-based curriculum in science courses, insufficient time, a lack of resources and a lack of university support. Furthermore, the majority of <b>teacher-educators</b> reported that the curriculum allows only limited exposure to inquiry when <b>teacher-educators</b> are burdened with a large teaching load as well as a shortage of time, limited resources and big classes. The <b>teacher-educators</b> commented that assessment allows them little autonomy in assessing student-teachers’ levels of science learning. Consequently, teacher-educators’ lack of motivation regarding the process of inquiry-based strategies was reported, which resulted in the reduced use of inquiry-based strategies. Thus, teacher-educators’ lack of motivation, difficulties in managing inquiry-based lessons and student-teachers’ low levels of confidence in using inquiry were all reported as more minor barriers which could be removed with a continued practice of inquiry-based approaches. Student-teachers’ perceptions from their questionnaires’ and focus groups’ data support the teacher-educators’ perceptions of the role and importance of inquiry-based pedagogy. Moreover, the majority of <b>teacher-educators</b> responded that student-teachers should be encouraged to develop an understanding of the process of inquiry. The emergent themes were discussed in the light of the existing literature in order to highlight similarities, as well as distinctive features in a Pakistani context. Finally, recommendations concerning the importance of inquiry-based pedagogy in science in ITE, the arrangement of resources, teacher-educators’ professional development, and preparation for student-teachers are presented for the attention of <b>teacher-educators,</b> the University administration, and Higher Education Authorities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of technology and}} {{the widespread use of}} ICT in the wealthier nations have led <b>teacher-educators</b> to integrate technological applications in their teaching environment. The research investigated the new teaching modes created by <b>teacher-educators</b> in teacher-training colleges in Israel, due to their transition from traditional teaching to distance-teaching through the Internet. This was a qualitative research using case study within an interpretative paradigm that enabled the researcher to consider the viewpoints of the informants together with her own viewpoint. The research tools included: 14 open interviews, a non-participatory observation, documentation reading and the writing of a personal log. The rich variety of research tools enabled triangulation of data. The conceptual framework of the research was based on theories of teacher-training, distance-teaching, academic disciplines, and several teaching dimensions: organisation and representation of data, organisation and management of teaching and different types of interaction. The research findings indicated intrinsic and extrinsic motives for the <b>teacher-educators</b> transition to distance-teaching. The transition created a pedagogy characterised by four teaching modes that corresponded to different academic disciplines. Each discipline harnessed the technology for intensive use in {{one or more of the}} teaching dimensions. The Representation mode used by <b>teacher-educators</b> in the natural sciences and statistics used a large variety of data representations and Internet writing characterised by multiple links. The Interactive mode employed by <b>teacher-educators</b> in the field of literacy principally dealt with formative assessment of the students' writing and used virtual communication tools to tighten the teacher-learner inter-personal interaction. The Organisational mode used in education disciplines focused on organisation and management of teaching and learning through the use of computer applications. The Holistic mode employed by <b>teacher-educators</b> in the fields of education and literature, in substance constituted a combination of all the characteristics of the above-mentioned modes with an emphasis given to social presence of both learners and the teacher. Analysis of the teaching modes led to the creation of a typology of four modes positioned at different points along the following scales: organisation of teaching, flexible – fixed, types of interaction few – multiple; data representation, creative – conservative; computer literate – computer users. There was a clear contrast between <b>teacher-educators</b> teaching education disciplines as a continuation of traditional frontal teaching and those who had previously taught in workshops. At the crossroads of pedagogy with technology, the changes in location, time and lesson character have meant that the implementation of the teaching paradigm of Zeichner and the teaching orientations of Feiman-Nemser have taken on fresh dimensions. The new teaching modes necessitate appropriate training for all <b>teacher-educators</b> working in distance-teaching in accordance with their academic disciplines. The research findings contribute to the reduction of a gap in knowledge concerning the new teaching modes of <b>teacher-educators</b> teaching distance-learning in a teacher-training college in Israel...|$|R

40|$|This chapter attends to learning-centred (also {{referred}} to as student-centred) approaches to assessment in teacher education. The term student-centred is used in this chapter, since learners in the South African context refers to school-going children, while students denote those individuals who are registered and studying at tertiary institutions. The student-centred approach is nested in constructivist thinking, assuming a dynamic relationship between the <b>teacher-educator</b> and the student-teacher, where the <b>teacher-educator</b> assumes the role of coach and mentor and the student-teacher is {{an active participant in}} the assessment process. This relationship implies that assessment is not solely the domain of some removed intellectual authority. Instead, the student-teacher plays an active role in learning and assessment, through a process of collaboration and dialogue. A constructivist approach suggests active participation in and interaction with assessment tasks, which are facilitated by the <b>teacher-educator.</b> For example, dialogue between the <b>teacher-educator</b> and the student-teacher can be fostered through the negotiation of assessment task criteria. Such dialogue can lead to authentic, functional and individualised assessment in a learning context that is meaningful for the student-teacher. The inseparably linked elements of student learning and assessment, assessment for learning during learning task execution, and the principles of good assessment are the core beliefs underpinning the learning-centred approach to teaching assessment.

Four mathematics education <b>teacher-educators</b> and twenty of their final year student-teachers of a particular university in Zambia participated in this study. Moreover, a total of one hundred and five learners (45 grade 9 s and 60 grade 12 s learners) from a selection of four Government schools in a particular province of Zambia participated in the study. My study specifically explored three critical questions, which are: 1. What do <b>teacher-educators</b> select and privilege {{with respect to the}} discourse of engaging with learner mathematical thinking? 2. What are student-teachers’ recognitions and realizations of the discourse of engaging with learner mathematical thinking? 3. What is the relationship between teacher-educators’ discourses of engaging with learner mathematical thinking and that of their student-teachers, and how might this be explained? Semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data that enabled me to answer these research questions. These included three interview schedules that were used to: 1. carry out individual interviews with the teacher-educators; 2. interview the student-teachers in their respective two focus groups of 10 student-teachers in each; and 3. interview 8 pairs of student-teachers on 3 scenarios of common learner errors in algebra described in literature and the other 3 scenarios that were elicited from learners’ own working. The findings show that teacher-educators’ privileged selections of what entails LMT is weakly classified and framed, hence implicit messages being relayed to student-teachers. Whether teacher-educators’ focus is on developing in learners both relational and instrumental understanding, or learner errors, or creating an environment where teacher can listen to learners, there is a range of mixed messages being relayed, hence messages within them are spread out. That is, the criteria for what counts as LMT are weak because they are spread out. Moreover, it is also evident that across all the three major categories, LMT is a practical accomplishment as principles that would guide discussions around it are not so clear. LMT is talked about when focus is on principles that guide discussions on topics/courses in the mathematics education curriculum. The indication here is that the privileging by the <b>teacher-educators</b> while in these three domains, some of the big discourses in the specialized fields of mathematics education research and mathematics education are filtering through but in a very weak way. As expected, student-teachers’ realization of what entails LMT is also weakly classified and framed but they were able to recruit or take-up some of the messages from their <b>teacher-educators</b> with further elaboration in some cases. While there is attention to LMT in the courses and it is discussed as within the courses by both the <b>teacher-educators</b> and the student-teachers, neither seem to be informed directly by the literature. This suggests that the talk about error while it relates to the literature is not discursively organised. In terms of positioning of student-teachers/teachers/teacher-educators or learners or the curriculum, <b>teacher-educators</b> as well as student-teachers hold contradictory views in referring to what is there pertaining to LMT as absences or presences. I have also shown that given scenarios on common learner errors in school algebra, student-teachers hold contradictory views on what teaching and learning entails despite constructivism being the theory espoused in their mathematics education courses. They equate teaching to learning; hence a transmission view as well as have the understanding that learners are not empty vessels but come with prior learning to the teaching and learning situation. This suggests that focus on LMT in terms of the nature of errors and strategies for carrying out error analysis is not a principled focus in these student-teachers’ mathematics education courses. This is further confirmed in that student-teachers spoke in the everyday professional knowledge of teaching and learning. I have therefore argued that ways in which LMT ought to be explicitly structured and focused on in teacher education be sought, for example, to include use of discursive resources from research. I have also made methodological and theoretical contributions to the specialized field of mathematics education research. In particular, methodologically, I have extended the use of the notion of an evaluative event as a unit of analysis on interviews unlike before when it was used on assessment tasks and instruction in teacher education. Theoretically, I have shown how my study has been an attempt towards developing the internal and external languages of description concerning the discourse of engaging with LMT, an issue of potential future development...|$|R

These challenges include {{the need for}} contextual data, privacy and confidentiality concerns, and technical issues involving search, data manipulation, analysis, and capture of selected scenes for teaching. In this article we examine the reuse practices of users from an educational repository {{and focus on the}} latter challenge – the ways that tools for discovery, access, and use influence data reuse among researchers, <b>teacher-educators,</b> and teachers in practice. We identify major issues such as reusers’ difficulties with video data management, the challenge of research collaborations with digital video, and preferences for common and familiar tools over specialized software to remix and/or analyze the video...|$|R
