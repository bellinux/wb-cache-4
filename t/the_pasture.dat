40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} floristic composition of pastures for wild animals (fallow deer, Manchurian deer and mouflons) at Przytoczno, pastures for horses at Białka, and cow <b>pastures</b> belonging to <b>the</b> Land Community in Tarnogóra. We analyzed the floristic composition of <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> under study in the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012, carried out 32 phytosociological relevés in <b>the</b> wild animal <b>pastures,</b> 32 in <b>the</b> horse <b>pastures,</b> and 38 in <b>the</b> cow <b>pastures,</b> using <b>the</b> Braun-Blanquet method. We determined the species diversity of <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> based on <b>the</b> percentage share of species from the botanical families distinguished, the total number of species, and the Shannon–Wiener and Simpson diversity index. Our floristic surveys indicated that the greatest species diversity occurred in <b>the</b> horse <b>pastures,</b> while it was lower in the wild animal and cow <b>pastures.</b> <b>The</b> Shannon–Wiener diversity index for the sward of <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> grazed by horses was higher (H' = 5. 04) than for those grazed by wild animals (H' = 4. 32) and cows (H' = 3. 53).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the floristic composition and species diversity existing in the seed-banks of forests and <b>pastures.</b> <b>The</b> seedbanks were sampled in three forest and three pastures areas in a community of smallholder farmers, in Para state, Brazil. Seedling emergence in a glasshouse was used to quantify and identify the seeds. The total densities and diversity of the seedbanks were not significantly different among <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> and forests, but the floristic composition was different. The herbaceous species predominated in both <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> and <b>the</b> forests, but in the forest the abundance of shrub and tree was higher than herb. The seed density of several pioneer woody species was higher in the forests and the density of several herbaceous species was greater in <b>the</b> <b>pastures.</b> <b>The</b> influence of the forest species on <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> and of <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> species on <b>the</b> forests is a result of the initial process of human occupation and illustrates a dynamic that can lead to both the conservation of forest species and the spread of weed species. Actions should be carried out to avoid disturbance in the forests and improve biodiversity preservation in rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Bird Funeral is {{a strange}} funeral custom in Tibet of China. The lamaists hope they can save small fauna such as pikas by sacrificing {{themselves}} to the eagles.

In contemporary Tibet, the eagle population is reducing drastically, and <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> are degenerating. People blame this on the excessive population of the plateau pikas. We propose a model to explain this phenomenon. The eagles are dying off because of overgrazing but not the pikas. We also point out that killing the pikas is probably unhelpful to recover <b>the</b> <b>pastures</b> but worsen <b>the</b> degeneration of <b>the</b> <b>pastures.</b> And if people want to recover <b>the</b> <b>pastures,</b> they have to increase both the population of the predator and the supply of grass simultaneously.

25|$|Nineteenth-century figure paintings, portraits, and genre {{pictures}} (portrayals {{of everyday}} life) represent an important {{chapter in the}} history of American art development, and several examples of these types of paintings are found in the ACMAA collection.

A summation of Eakins’ painting technique and belief system, Swimming was acquired for the ACMAA collection in 1990.

In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity and, by his widespread domain, the protector of the Romans in their military activities beyond the borders of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods Mars and Quirinus, who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Quirinus is thought by modern scholars to have been the patron of the armed community in time of peace.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} grazing {{practices}} that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book {{he uses the}} example of a rancher in Arizona who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened leopard frogs (Rana chiricahuensis), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle, and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining vernal pools would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions. In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland. Another example from Rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) to populate pastureland by placing perches around <b>the</b> <b>pasture.</b> These are all simple, low-cost ways to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting the human uses of the landscape.|$|E
