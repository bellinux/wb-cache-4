West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became {{the majority of the}} pastoral groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, even among the ruling dynasty members.|$|E
5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v.

Georgia, came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where {{information}} in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where {{it is used to}} make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> amino acids.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Middle Ages, England was a part of Britannia, a former {{province}} of the Roman Empire. The local economy had once been dominated by imperial Roman spending on a large military establishment, which in turn helped to support a complex network of towns, roads, and villas. At the end of the 4th century, however, Roman forces had been largely withdrawn, and this economy collapsed. Germanic immigrants began to arrive in increasing numbers during the 5th century, establishing small farms and settlements, and their language, Old English, swiftly spread as people switched from British Celtic and British Latin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> this new elite. New political and social identities emerged, including an Anglian culture in the east of England and a Saxon culture in the south, with local groups establishing regiones, small polities ruled over by powerful families and individuals. By the 7th century, some rulers, including those of Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, and Kent, had begun to term themselves kings, living in villae regales, royal centres, and collecting tribute from the surrounding regiones; these kingdoms are {{often referred to as the}} Heptarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Ch'olan {{languages}} were formerly widespread {{throughout the}} Maya area, {{but today the}} language with most speakers is Ch'ol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 {{in the state of}} Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Ch'orti', which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Ch'olti', a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct. Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.|$|E

25|$|The first work of {{the young}} seventeen-year-old Artemisia was the Susanna e i Vecchioni (Susanna and the Elders) (1610, Schönborn {{collection}} in Pommersfelden). At the time some, influenced by the prevailing misconceptions, suspected that she was helped by her father. The painting shows how Artemisia assimilated the realism of Caravaggio without being indifferent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the Bologna school, which had Annibale Carracci among its major artists.

It was sent to Belgrade to be printed, but this did not happen for an unknown reason, and it had to be printed in Thessaloniki nine years later, in 1840, by Theodosius of Sinaia. During the printing Theodosius substituted Peychinovich's original introduction with his own one, but still preserved the text that referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the work as the 'common Bulgarian language of Lower Moesia, of Skopje and Tetovo' (простїй Ѧзыкъ болгарский долнїѦ Мүссїи Скопсский и Тетовский).|$|E
25|$|The primal graph G(H) of a {{hypergraph}} is {{the graph}} {{on the same}} vertex set that has as its edges the pairs of vertices appearing {{together in the same}} hyperedge. A hypergraph is said to be conformal if every maximal clique of its primal graph is a hyperedge, or equivalently, if every clique of its primal graph is contained in some hyperedge. If the hypergraph is required to be downward-closed (so it contains all hyperedges that are contained in some hyperedge) then the hypergraph is conformal precisely when it is a flag complex. This relates the language of hypergraphs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> simplicial complexes.|$|E

25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
