5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>area</b> before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E
5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> <b>area.</b> He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E

Organic aerosols dominated the mass concentrations on all evaluated days, with a 45  % increase in organics on cyclone days across all three regions, while the increase during the cyclone episode was up to [*]∼[*]  80  % over <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> metropolitan <b>area.</b> In <b>the</b> most aged air masses (NO x  / NO y  [*]<[*]  0. 5), background organic aerosols over <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> metropolitan <b>area</b> increased by a factor of ∼[*]  2. 5 due to transport from Northern Front Range. Furthermore, enhanced partitioning of nitric acid to the aerosol phase was observed during the cyclone episodes, mainly due to increased abundance of gas phase ammonia. During the non-cyclone events, β ext displayed strong correlations (r  [*]=[*]  0. 71) with organic and nitrate in the Northern Front Range and only with organics (r  [*]=[*]  0. 70) in <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> metropolitan <b>area,</b> while correlation of  β ext during the cyclone was strongest (r  [*]=[*]  0. 86) with nitrate over Denver. Mass extinction efficiency (MEE) values in <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> metropolitan <b>area</b> were similar on cyclone and non-cyclone days despite the dominant influence of different aerosol species on  β ext. Our analysis showed that the meteorological patterns associated with <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> Cyclone increased aerosol mass loadings in <b>the</b> <b>Denver</b> metropolitan <b>area</b> mainly by transporting aerosols and/or aerosol precursors from the northern regions, leading to impaired visibility and air quality deterioration...|$|R

The San Jose Mercury News reported that San Francisco Bay Area Caltrain commuters are much less likely to be in a head-on collision because opposing trains usually run on separate tracks, and runs freight only at night on a large portion of its route.
