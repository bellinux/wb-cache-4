5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>three</b> would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
