5|$|After many {{internal}} {{conflicts between}} Porcelain Black and her long-time collaborator, RedOne, the artist announced via social media that plans to release her long-anticipated album were cancelled. Plans {{to release a}} new album, in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of her previous project, Porcelain and the Tramps, is expected for late 2017. Music from her new project will feature the same attitude of the singer's previous works with slower, mid-tempo songs and rapping.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{squeezing}} {{and releasing}} – the examiner can compress <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> below the probe which will push {{the blood in}} its normal anterograde direction.

50|$|<b>The</b> hemiazygos <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> {{accessory}} hemiazygos <b>vein,</b> {{when taken}} together, essentially {{serve as the}} left-sided equivalent of <b>the</b> azygos <b>vein.</b> That is, <b>the</b> azygos <b>vein</b> serves to drain most of <b>the</b> posterior intercostal <b>veins</b> on <b>the</b> {{right side of the}} body, and <b>the</b> hemiazygos <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> accessory hemiazygos <b>vein</b> drain most of <b>the</b> posterior intercostal <b>veins</b> on <b>the</b> left side of the body.

5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies venous insufficiency, <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened {{to come up}} with the design for the game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 mm. The forewings are dark grey, with all <b>the</b> <b>veins,</b> <b>the</b> fringe, and inner margin narrowly white. The hindwings are white with grey streaks between <b>the</b> <b>veins</b> outwardly.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{superior}} mesenteric <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein</b> {{come together}} to form the actual hepatic portal <b>vein.</b> <b>The</b> inferior mesenteric <b>vein</b> connects in <b>the</b> majority of people on <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein,</b> but in some people, it is known to connect on <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> or <b>the</b> superior mesenteric <b>vein.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm. The forewings are dull greyish brown, without any markings, except for brownish fuscous accentuation of <b>the</b> <b>veins.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are brownish fuscous, with black accentuation of <b>the</b> <b>veins.</b>|$|R
5|$|After her audience's {{demand to}} {{continue}} performing similar songs, Gočeva decided {{to record a}} second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče. In {{the initial stages of}} the album's development, Makedonsko Devojče 2 served only as a working title and later became its official title in order to emphasize that the musical style is {{the same as that of}} Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts <b>the</b> <b>vein,</b> but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
50|$|Male: The forewings' ground colour is black. <b>The</b> <b>veins</b> {{are lightly}} bordered by white. The {{underside}} of the forewings is dark brown. <b>The</b> <b>veins</b> are bordered by white. The hindwings are black.

50|$|In most individuals, <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> {{is formed}} by the union of <b>the</b> {{superior}} mesenteric <b>vein</b> and <b>the</b> splenic <b>vein.</b> For this reason, <b>the</b> portal <b>vein</b> is occasionally called the splenic-mesenteric confluence.

5|$|The {{concert in}} Cologne was {{recorded}} and released as an album titled Symphonic Odysseys by Dog Ear Records, Nobuo Uematsu's recording label. It was announced {{to be in}} production on October 26, 2011, and released on December 28, 2011. The artwork for the album features {{a cross between a}} sword and a violin on a white background, in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of the Symphonic Fantasies album, which had a cross between a violin and a game controller. The cover art was produced by German design house Schech, who earlier provided the artwork for the European release of Symphonic Fantasies. Accompanying the CD is a booklet which contains photos of the concert and discusses the arrangers and compositions included in each song. The album contains everything played at the concert, with the Final Fantasy suite split into three tracks, and the album is split at the intermission into two CDs. Its fourteen tracks have a duration of 1:34:56. While Dog Ear Records published the album in Japan, the album was released in Europe through the online music retailer MAZ-Sound.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time as the group was {{rejected}} by Nintendo, Romero was approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software, who wanted him to publish more levels for his previous Pyramids of Egypt—an adventure game where the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee's shareware model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing where part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero said he could not, as Pyramids of Egypt was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on was much better, and sent Miller the Mario demo. Miller was impressed, and the Ideas from the Deep agreed to create a new game for Apogee before Christmas of 1990—only a few months away—split into three parts to match Apogee's shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole. Hall suggested a console-style platformer in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme, and developed a short introduction that convinced the team to make Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

5000|$|The Ffestiniog region {{contains}} {{five major}} slate veins, which are {{on top of}} a thick layer of feldspathic porphyry, called the [...] "Glanypwll Trap". <b>The</b> <b>veins</b> are <b>the</b> New or Deep <b>Vein,</b> <b>the</b> Old <b>Vein,</b> <b>the</b> Small <b>Vein,</b> <b>the</b> Back <b>Vein</b> and <b>the</b> North <b>Vein.</b> At Croesor Quarry, <b>the</b> Old <b>Vein</b> is accessible, and dips downwards at about 27 degrees. It is around 120 ft wide, at right angles to the bedding plane, and over 330 ft horizontally. Slate was quarried on a small scale at Croesor from around 1840, and the Croicer Valley & Portmadoc Freehold Slate Company Ltd was set up soon afterwards, but did not last for long.|$|R
5|$|The 2000s saw {{formation}} of several pioneering Oriental metal bands from the Arab world, the best-known {{of which is}} Myrath from Tunisia. They have released four albums (three internationally) and have toured in Europe with Orphaned Land. Their sound combined progressive metal (in <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> of Dream Theater, et al.) with specifically Arab & North African melodies and themes. The Kordz from Lebanon straddle the line between hard rock and progressive metal, and again draw on local folk melodies (produced mainly via keyboards) to broaden the sonic palette. Hard rock band Lazywall from Morocco frequently makes use of oud and djembe in their music, producing something analogous to Oriental metal (though generally no heavier than Alice in Chains). North Africa has had a growing metal scene for some time, {{and a few of}} those bands have ventured into folk-metal, notably Andaz Azzul from Algeria, which blends Berber melodies & themes with violin and metal. And Egypt's truly path-breaking female-fronted Oriental metal band Massive Scar Era has recently broken through and has posted official videos on YouTube, though they continue to face considerable discrimination at home, with frontwoman Sherine reporting harassment on account of her participation. Their sound has broadened to include the heavy use of violin (in effect making them a folk-metal band, rather than simply another of the growing profusion of heavy metal bands in the Middle East).|$|E
25|$|Minor {{colonoscopy}} risks {{may include}} nausea, vomiting or allergies to the sedatives that are used. If medication is given intravenously, <b>the</b> <b>vein</b> may become irritated.
