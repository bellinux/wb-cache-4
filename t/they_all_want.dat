Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many {{of the people in the}} arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.|$|E

Richards {{said that he}} did not want to take the stage with someone wearing a [...] "coronet and sporting the old ermine. It's not what the Stones is about, is it?" [...] Jagger retorted: [...] "I think he would probably like to get the same honour himself. It's like being given an ice creamone gets one and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> one." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1964 season, Timberlake {{was awarded}} the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. [...] He placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting (losing to Notre Dame's John Huarte), and was also named to {{multiple}} All-American teams. [...] After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, [...] "There {{is a great deal of}} loneliness in being an All-America[...] [...] [...] I get sick of it. [...] <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to shake your hand, but they don't really know you. [...] All they do is stick out the glad hand. [...] I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America." [...] He joked that he might write an autobiography called, [...] "The Loneliness of an All-America." [...] He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{are on the}} {{run after}} they are {{attacked}} at their safehouse; Hurley drives the unconscious Sayid, who has been hit by two drugged darts, to his parents' house. On the way, Hurley is pulled over by deceased Oceanic Flight 815 survivor and former police officer Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who gives him {{advice on how to}} avoid the real cops. Upon arriving home, Hurley's dad, David, covers for them when the police show up and suggests that Hurley take Sayid to the hospital. Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story. Later, Ben unexpectedly shows up at the house and tries to convince Hurley to go with him to meet up {{with the rest of the}} Oceanic Six, saying <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> the same thing—to go back to the island. Hurley wavers for a moment, then runs outside and turns himself in to police watching the house, having been advised by Sayid to do the opposite of whatever Ben asks. Later, Ben visits Ms. Hawking, who tells him she has found the island and that Ben only has seventy hours to return to it with Locke's corpse and the Oceanic Six.|$|E
2500|$|To Nimoy's surprise, Spock {{became a}} sex symbol; Isaac Asimov {{described}} the character as [...] "a security blanket with sexual overtones", and Nimoy reported that [...] "I've never had more female {{attention on a}} set before.

[...] (When a young woman asked [...] "Are you aware {{that you are the}} source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?", he replied [...] "May all your dreams come true".)

2500|$|Susan Griffin {{was one of}} {{the first}} feminists to write on pornography's {{implications}} in her 1981 Pornography and Silence. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, [...] "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual." [...] She explained sexual harassment by saying that it [...] "doesn't mean that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to fuck us, they just want to hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us." [...] Some see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the success}} of rock in Australia is {{attributed}} to the non-commercial Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, which focuses heavily on Australian alternative music, and has done so since its formation as 2JJ in 1975. Throughout the station's history, they have helped jump start the careers of numerous bands, through programs such as Unearthed, the Australian Music program Home & Hosed and the Hottest 100. The Big Day Out festival has showcased Australian and international acts, with line-ups spanning multiple genres, with an alternative focus. It has become highly popular amongst musicians; Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl said [...] "We play the Big Day Out because it's the best tour in the world. You ask any band in the world – <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to play the Big Day Out, every single one of them." [...] Other festivals, such as Homebake, Livid, and Splendour in the Grass, are also rock focused, and together with Big Day Out are [...] "united by the dominant presence of the indie-guitar scene".|$|E
