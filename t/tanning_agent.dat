50|$|Canthaxanthin is most {{commonly}} used as a color additive in certain foods. Although the FDA has approved the use of canthaxanthin in food, it does not approve its use as a <b>tanning</b> <b>agent.</b> When used as a color additive, only very small amounts of canthaxanthin are necessary. As a <b>tanning</b> <b>agent,</b> however, much larger quantities are used. After canthaxanthin is consumed, it is deposited throughout the body, including in the layer of fat below the skin, which turns an orange-brown color. These types of tanning pills {{have been linked to}} various side effects, including hepatitis and canthaxanthin retinopathy, a condition in which yellow deposits form in the retina of the eye. Other side effects including damage to the digestive system and skin surface have also been noted. The FDA withdrew approval for use of canthaxanthin as a <b>tanning</b> <b>agent,</b> and has issued warnings concerning its use.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom <b>tanning</b> <b>agents</b> by production of leather. This will be achieved by extracting of natural <b>tanning</b> <b>agents</b> from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the <b>tanning</b> <b>agents</b> on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the tanning substances in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and <b>tanning</b> <b>agents.</b> In Reynoutria the tanning substances are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The tanning substances were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the tanning substances in raw material determined by calibration with tanning substances from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum. Further investigations should concentrate on the production and utilisation of the different pigments found in the roots of Rheum and Rumex for use in heavy metal-free dyeing of leather and textiles.

50|$|Once bating is complete, the {{hides and skins}} {{are treated}} first with salt and then with sulfuric acid, in case a mineral tanning is to be done.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} whether the protein crosslinking enzymes, transglutaminases, {{had the potential to}} be used as <b>tanning</b> <b>agents,</b> using native bovine hide and purified soluble rat tail collagen as real and model substrates, respectively. We demonstrate that transglutaminases (TGs) were capable of covalently crosslinking collagen molecules together such that on average every collagen molecule contained at least one epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine crosslink. However, transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking did not affect the denaturation temperature of either native bovine hide or soluble rat tail collagens when used in isolation or together with other proteins and bifunctional diamines as crosslinking facilitators. In an initial study into the effect of TG-mediated crosslinking on the tensile strength of chrome-tanned bovine hide, such crosslinking led to a 30 per cent decrease in tensile strength. Despite a change in the gel melting point mediated by epsilon(gamma-glutamyl) lysine crosslinking, the use of transglutaminases as alternative <b>tanning</b> <b>agents</b> seems unlikely given the present data...|$|R
