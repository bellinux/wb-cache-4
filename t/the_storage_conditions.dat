40|$|Appropriate storage {{strategies}} were helpful {{in keeping the}} integrity and activity {{as well as in}} promoting the engineering application of granular sludge. The particle size distribution, composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), and activity of shortcut nitrification aerobic granular sludge (SNAGS) of <b>the</b> different <b>storage</b> strategies (15 °C with intermittent aeration, 4 °C, − 20 °C, and − 80 °C) were investigated in this study. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> strategies influenced particle size distribution, EPSs, protein (PN), polysaccharide (PS), PN/PS, and the oxidation ability of ammonium nitrogen of SNAGS. However, storage strategies had little effect on nitrite accumulation. The particle size, EPSs, PN, and PS of the SNAGS decreased after <b>storage.</b> <b>The</b> change of EPSs, PN, and PS of SNGS was smaller under <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> of − 20 °C. The ammonium nitrogen oxidation and denitrification abilities of SNAGS were highest under <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> of − 80 °C and − 20 °C.

30|$|According to {{the results}} {{described}} above, AFB 1 content should increase with increasing the temperature given the same humidity during storage, and vice verse. Our results showed that temperature and humidity {{played an important role}} in the growth of the A. flavus and the production of aflatoxins. After analysis using RSM, we concluded that the growth of A. flavus and production of aflatoxins could be minimized by maintaining the temperature below 25  °C and the humidity below 85 %. Therefore, these conditions can be recommended as <b>the</b> best <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> for preventing <b>the</b> infection of the A. oxyphylla sample by A. flavus. Liu found that Areca catechu was not susceptible to mildew infection or toxin production in environments with humidity below 90 % and temperature below 25  °C (Liu et al. 2015).

50|$|The depot {{began its}} {{existence}} as the Hawthorne Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD).

The accident virtually destroyed the depot, causing heavy damage to adjacent Picatinny Arsenal and the surrounding communities, killing 21 people, and seriously injuring 53 others. The monetary loss to the Navy alone was $84 million, just over $1 billion today (mostly in consumed explosives). As {{a result of a}} full-scale Congressional investigation, the seventieth Congress in 1928 directed the establishment of a Board of Officers to provide oversight of <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> of explosives.

5000|$|Nitrate film is {{chemically}} {{unstable and}} over time can decay into a sticky mass or a powder akin to gunpowder. This process can be very unpredictable: some nitrate film from the 1890s is still in good condition today, while some much later nitrate had to be scrapped as unsalvageable when it was barely 20 years old. Much depends on {{the environment in which}} it is stored. Ideal conditions of low temperature, low humidity, and adequate ventilation can preserve nitrate film for centuries, but in practice, <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> were usually far from ideal. When a film on nitrate base {{is said to have been}} [...] "preserved", this almost always means simply that it has been copied onto safety film or, more recently, digitized; both methods result in some loss of quality.|$|E
50|$|Because PolyHeme was a {{hemoglobin}} {{solution and}} did not contain intact red blood cells which express ABO antigens, cross-matching of the product or typing of the patient was not necessary.

Another advantage was its acceptance by some patients seeking bloodless medical care. Of note, not all patients who object to blood transfusions would have accepted PolyHeme as the hemoglobin is derived from human blood.

50|$|Once the War was over, Clay {{continued}} to innovate {{by helping to}} set up an internal bindery unit in the House of Lords, which led to a reduction in the amount of material that needed to be sent out to external binders. The bindery, which was established in 1946 under the management of the Stationery Office (HMSO), still exists today and is still used by the Library, although it is now run by staff of the British Library. The same year saw the establishment by the Clerk of the Parliaments of the House of Lords Record Office (now known as the Parliamentary Archives), set up to look after the archives of both Houses of Parliament in the Victoria Tower. In the years since, a sizeable number of historic and special items that used to be kept in the Library have been transferred to the Archives, where <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> are more suitable for them; the death warrant of Charles I is the most notable example.

5000|$|Affected objects {{may show}} surface {{irregularities}} such as small cracks and fractures, blisters or pitting. Over time, the material slowly expands, cracking, buckling and warping in an irreversible process {{that makes the}} object exceedingly brittle and prone to fracture, and can eventually shatter the object, destroying it altogether. Due to the expansion process, attached normal material may also be damaged. The occurrence and severity of zinc pest in articles made of susceptible zinc alloys depends both on the concentration of lead impurities in the metal and on <b>the</b> <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> of the article in the ensuing decades. Zinc pest is dreaded by collectors of vintage die-cast model trains, toys, or radios, because rare or otherwise valuable items can inescapably be rendered worthless as the process of zinc pest destroys them. Because castings of the same object were usually made from various batches of metal over the production process, some examples of a given toy or model may survive today completely unaffected, while other identical examples may have completely disintegrated. Since the 1940s, some model railroad hobbyists have claimed, {{with varying degrees of}} success, that a method of [...] "pickling" [...] zinc alloy parts by soaking them in vinegar or oxalic acid solution for several minutes before painting and assembling them could prevent or delay the effects of zinc pest. Engine parts of older vehicles or airplanes, and military medals made of zinc alloys may also be affected.|$|E
