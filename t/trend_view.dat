40|$|The Persian Gulf {{is part of}} an {{asymmetric}} foreland basin {{related to}} the Zagros Orogen. It has been episodically flooded for much of its history which are reflected in sedimentary successions. The evaluation of this succession from depositional <b>trend</b> <b>view,</b> in central Persian Gulf during Paleocene-Eocene, is the aim of this article. The sedimentary rocks physical characteristics effects on seismic data, gives an appearance to the data, which can be a key factor for their evaluation. The reflectors geometry and terminations have been used for their interpretation. The current study the uses seismic data beside drilling wells data, including cutting description and logs. The study result shows progradation toward northeast, the direction in which the accommodation space is increasing. The sedimentary environments changes to lagoon, platform and basin which affect the deposits. These environments demonstrate suitable condition for carbonates and evaporites precipitation, in Jahrum Formation, which are approved by cutting ription. The sediments extension and its trend show high thickness of Paleocene-Eocene deposits in north west of the study area, where the basin is deeper. In some intervals the thickness of sediments is decreased in deep basin, due to sediment starvation...|$|E
40|$|Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), {{an abrupt}} {{deterioration}} in kidney function, {{is defined by}} changes in urine output or serum creatinine. AKI is common (affecting up to 20 % of acute hospital admissions in the United Kingdom), associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and expensive (excess costs to the National Health Service in England alone may exceed £ 1 billion per year). NHS England has mandated the implementation of an automated algorithm to detect AKI based on changes in serum creatinine, and to alert clinicians. It is uncertain, however, whether ‘alerting’ alone improves care quality.   We have thus developed a digitally-enabled care pathway as a clinical service to inpatients in the Royal Free Hospital (RFH), a large London hospital. This pathway incorporates a mobile software application - the “Streams-AKI” app, developed by DeepMind Health - that applies the NHS AKI algorithm to routinely collected serum creatinine data in hospital inpatients. Streams-AKI alerts clinicians to potential AKI cases, furnishing them with a <b>trend</b> <b>view</b> of kidney function alongside other relevant data, in real-time, on a mobile device. A clinical response team comprising nephrologists and critical care nurses responds to these AKI alerts by reviewing individual patients and administering interventions according to existing clinical practice guidelines.   We propose a mixed methods service evaluation of the implementation of this care pathway. This evaluation will assess how the care pathway meets the health and care needs of service users (RFH inpatients), in terms of clinical outcome, processes of care, and NHS costs. It will also seek to assess acceptance of the pathway {{by members of the}} response team and wider hospital community. All analyses will be undertaken by the service evaluation team from UCL (Department of Applied Health Research) and St George’s, University of London (Population Health Research Institute) ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{deployment}} of multi-modality and large-scale sensor networks for monitoring air quality, we {{are now able to}} collect large and multi-dimensional spatio-temporal datasets. For these sensed data, we present a comprehensive visual analysis approach for air quality analysis. This approach integrates several visual methods, such as map-based views, calendar <b>views,</b> and <b>trends</b> <b>views,</b> to assist the analysis. Among those visual methods, map-based visual methods are used to display the locations of interest, and the calendar and the <b>trends</b> <b>views</b> are used to discover the linear and periodical patterns. The system also provides various interaction tools to combine the map-based visualization, <b>trends</b> <b>view,</b> calendar view and multi-dimensional view. In addition, we propose a self-adaptive calendar-based controller that can flexibly adapt the changes of data size and granularity in <b>trends</b> <b>view.</b> Such a visual analytics system would facilitate big-data analysis in real applications, especially for decision making support...|$|R

40|$|In the 1990 s, {{conventional}} {{measures of}} productivity growth, or {{the growth in}} output per worker, have indicated a dramatic rise. If these measures are correct, the economic benefits are clear. In the short run, sustained, faster productivity growth would enable the economy to expand more rapidly without intensifying inflationary pressures. In the long run, sustained, faster productivity growth would boost real incomes and improve the standard of living. Since 1960, for example, productivity advances have helped the typical worker produce 70 percent more output per hour, more than doubling personal incomes. Despite signs that productivity has recently begun to follow a steeper path, some analysts are skeptical. Episodes of faster productivity growth {{in the past have}} often reflected cyclical influences rather than fundamental trend shifts. And, the conventional productivity measure, which is based on fixedweighted productivity data, has recently shown an upward bias. To address these concerns, this article reexamines the conventional, fixed-weighted productivity Andrew J. Filardo is an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Paul Cooper, a research associate at the bank, helped prepare the article. measure and also uses a new chain-weighted measure to assess productivity growth. The first section of the article summarizes the empirical evidence and describes the theoretical arguments in support of the view that the trend of productivity has steepened. The second section challenges this view of productivity in three parts. The first part challenges the theoretical arguments. The next part suggests the standard statistical tests overstate the significance of the apparent increase in the trend of productivity because they disregard cyclical influences. The final part describes the recent bias of the conventional, fixed-weighted data and shows that statistical analysis using the new chainweighted data sharply contradicts the steeper <b>trend</b> <b>view.</b> Based on this analysis, the article concludes that the productivity trend has not steepened in th...|$|E

The US {{magazine}} Motor Trend described the rack-and-pinion steering as being [...] "of surpassing excellence and must be experienced to be appreciated" [...] {{in a review of}} the 604 SL. Turning to the suspension, Motor Trend wrote that [...] "springing is soft {{with a great deal of}} wheel travel. Movement is damped in jounce and particularly rebound in the manner that only the French, and perhaps BMW, seem to be able to achieve". Despite the comfortable ride, the handling remained secure. The car [...] "leans a bit but clings like a limpet in both fast and slow curves". Braking was described as [...] "excellent", having a decelerating g-force of 0.875. The only weak area was performance, the 604 [...] "not coming up the standards of excellence set by ride, handling and stopping ability". The review added that [...] "acceleration and speed are adequate to keep from being overrun by other traffic but by no means can performance be considered brilliant". This was countered by the cars ability to maintain high average speeds on account of its capacity to cope with [...] "twisting, poorly surfaced roads". Overall, given the car´s remit as a luxury saloon, Motor <b>Trend</b> <b>viewed</b> this performance limitation as being of secondary importance. In conclusion, Motor <b>Trend</b> <b>viewed</b> the 604 as being [...] "competitively priced" [...] and offering buyers [...] "a new choice, a new arrangement of priorities...if comfort, quality and security are high on the priority list, that fact alone has to make the Peugeot 604 a bit of a bargain".|$|R

40|$|A central {{debate in}} phonological {{research}} concerns the interface of phonetics and phonology. One major <b>trend</b> <b>views</b> phonology as an abstract cognitive system and considers as primary evidence {{the system of}} contrasts, regardless of its phonetic and acoustic correlates (Dresher and Zhang 2000). This {{can be understood as}} a backlash against another trend in the 1990 's: the tendency to see phonological patterns as arising out of low-level phonetic events (Steriade 1995). In this talk, I argue that phonological activity is dependent on the structure of the contrast system of a given language. Based on the system of contrast, the analysis of language into an economic and exhaustive set of features is achieved, and the resulting set of distinctive features is able to uniquely define natural classes of segments, which are responsible for all kinds of phonological behavior in language. I illustrate this with regard to Cairene Arabic. The analysis will focus on the phonological phenomenon of dorsal harmony, traditionally known as emphasis spread (ES), the understanding of which has direct implications for the size and structure of the segment inventory. One interesting characteristic about Cairene Arabic inventory is that all segments except [q] have emphatic counterparts, but some of these are found only in very restricte...|$|R
