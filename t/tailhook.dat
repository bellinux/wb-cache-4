5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the <b>tailhook</b> to counter the sideways forces placed on the <b>tailhook.</b> Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E

He was survived by his daughters Jamie and Jaleen, and his step daughter Karen. He had four grandchildren and four great grandchildren. A scholarship was established by the <b>Tailhook</b> Educational Foundation in his honor.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no <b>tailhook,</b> so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, surplus J33s {{were used}} in jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots to test {{aircraft}} carrier arresting gear cables and <b>tailhooks</b> at Lakehurst.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, on 16 December, the Finns {{signed a}} {{contract}} to purchase 44 Model 239 fighters. The total agreed price was U.S. $3.4 million, and the deal included spare parts, ten replacement engines and 20 Hamilton Standard propellers. The Buffalos sent to Finland were de-navalized; all the naval equipment, such as <b>tailhooks</b> and life-raft containers were removed, resulting in a lighter aircraft. The Finnish F2A-1s also lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and cockpit armor.|$|R
5000|$|Lakehurst conducts {{the unique}} mission of {{supporting}} and developing the Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment and Support Equipment for naval aviation. Since the 1950s, aviation boatswain's mates {{have been trained}} at Lakehurst to operate catapults and arresting systems on aircraft carriers using rail guided jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots tested carrier arresting gear cables and <b>tailhooks.</b> [...] The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and the Advanced Arresting Gear system that will replace the existing steam catapults and the Mk-7 arresting gear are being developed and tested at Lakehurst at full-scale shipboard representative test facilities here.|$|R
25|$|The JL-9G is a {{modified}} JL-9 for aircraft carrier training. It {{is designed for}} ski-jump ramp takeoffs and arrested landings. and includes a <b>tailhook.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels {{and a single}} wheel on each main gear. A runway <b>tailhook</b> or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the <b>Tailhook</b> scandal, Boorda faced hostility from a {{majority}} of naval flag officers who reportedly believed he had betrayed the Navy by allying himself with Clinton administration demands for reform of the Navy's officer corps. Naval aviators, in particular, were incensed by the treatment of Stan Arthur (Vice Chief of Naval Operations and senior Naval aviator), whose nomination for the post of commander, United States Pacific Command was withdrawn by President Clinton at the behest of U.S. Senator David Durenberger.|$|E
500|$|Hayward was {{promoted}} to captain again on 19 February 1949. On 7 March, he took off Coral Sea in the Atlantic in a P2V carrying a dummy Little Boy pumpkin bomb, and flew across the United States to make a simulated attack on the Salton Sea test site near El Centro, California. He then flew to Patuxent River, where he landed after a total of 23 hours flying. [...] Hayward had <b>tailhooks</b> fitted {{to a pair of}} P2Vs, and made practice landings on a carrier deck painted on the ground at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, He made some touch and go passes at the , but a carrier landing was considered too dangerous for regular crews to attempt.|$|R
5|$|British {{forces were}} ordered {{withdrawn}} {{a few days}} later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June, and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 Squadron and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 823 Squadron for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. This {{was the first time that}} high performance monoplanes without <b>tailhooks</b> had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|R
5000|$|Bunker Hill {{departed}} Pearl Harbor on 19 October {{en route}} to the Southwest Pacific. The carrier's air group participated in the air raid on the major Imperial Japanese Navy base at Rabaul, along with [...] and [...] on 11 November 1943. During the mission the carriers' fighters (VF-18) escorted bombers to Rabaul, and CV-17 was reunited with VF-17, then land-based at Ondonga Airfield in the Solomon Islands. The <b>tailhooks</b> were reinstalled on the squadron's Corsairs, enabling them to land and refuel on their former ship while providing air cover to the task force as its own planes were escorting the raid on Rabaul. [...] On 14 November the carrier set a course for the Gilbert Islands to cover the invasion and occupation of Tarawa.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} he was desk {{officer for the}} Navyâ€™s Forward Maritime Strategy and then special {{assistant}} to Vice Admiral Henry C. Mustin II {{in the office of}} the Chief of Naval Operations. In the early 1990s he was on the personal staff of Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III during the <b>Tailhook</b> scandal. In his 1998 book Against All Enemies, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh wrote approvingly about Pocalyko's role as a veterans advocate with respect to the controversial Persian Gulf War Syndrome during his years in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1993 to 1995.|$|E
25|$|Designated the XFC-130H, the {{aircraft}} were fitted with 30 maneuvering rockets in five sets: eight firing forward to stop {{the aircraft}}, eight downward to slow its descent, eight rearward for takeoff assist, four on the wings to stabilize them during takeoff transition, and two {{at the rear of}} the tail to prevent it from striking the ground because of over-rotation. Other STOL features included a dorsal and two ventral fins on the rear fuselage, double-slotted flaps and extended ailerons, a new radome, a <b>tailhook</b> for landing aboard an aircraft carrier, and Combat Talon avionics, including a TF/TA radar, a defensive countermeasures suite, and a Doppler radar/GPS tie-in to the aircraft's inertial navigation system.|$|E
25|$|Also on {{the social}} side, Aspin {{had to deal with}} the {{volatile}} question of servicewomen in combat. In April 1993 he announced a revised policy on the assignment of women in the armed forces: The services were to allow women to compete for assignments in combat aircraft; the Navy was to open additional ships to women and draft a proposal for Congress to remove existing legislative barriers to the assignment of women to combat vessels; and the Army and Marine Corps were to look for opportunities for women to serve in such components as field artillery and air defense. (This was a response to recommendations made by an ad hoc committee chaired by Barbara S. Pope appointed in the wake of the <b>Tailhook</b> scandal.) Meanwhile, Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall became the first woman service secretary.|$|E
50|$|The {{barricade}} webbing {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} horizontal loading straps joined to {{each other at the}} ends. Five vertical engaging straps, spaced 20 feet apart, are connected to each upper and lower load strap. The barricade webbing is raised to a height of approximately 20 feet. The barricade webbing engages the wings of the landing aircraft, wherein energy is transmitted from the barricade webbing through the purchase cable to the arresting engine. Following a barricade arrestment, the webbing and deck cables are discarded and the stanchions are lowered back into their recessed slots. Barricade engagements are rare, as <b>tailhooks</b> are designed to be extremely fail-safe, and an aircraft returning from combat with such severe damage would likely not be able to land. This device has been installed on all American aircraft carriers and on the French Charles de Gaulle while Brazilian CATOBAR, Russian and Indian STOBAR aircraft carriers have only conventional arresting gear installed.|$|R
500|$|However, {{even this}} success {{proved to be}} ephemeral and British forces were ordered {{withdrawn}} a few days later. The evacuation (Operation Alphabet) began in the north {{on the night of}} 3/4 June and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support although she only carried nine Sea Gladiators of 802 and six Swordfish from 823 Squadrons for self-defence as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if at all possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes. These had been flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation after the pilots discovered that a [...] sandbag carried {{in the rear of the}} Hurricane allowed full brakes to be applied immediately on landing. This was the first time that high-performance monoplanes without <b>tailhooks</b> had been landed on an aircraft carrier.|$|R
2500|$|Since Corsairs {{were being}} {{operated}} from shore bases, while still awaiting approval for U.S. carrier operations, {{a number of}} FG-1As were built without their hydraulic wing folding mechanisms being installed, hoping to improve performance by reducing aircraft weight, with {{the added benefit of}} minimizing complexity. (These Corsairsâ€™ wings could still be manually folded.) [...] USMC aircraft historian Jack Elliotâ€™s research has determined that only about 60 FG-1As were manufactured before these modifications were terminated because there was little performance advantage, while there were real logistical challenges for Goodyear. [...] A second option was to remove the folding mechanism in the field using a kit, which could be done for Vought and Brewster Corsairs as well. [...] On Dec 6, 1943, the Bureau of Aeronautics issued guidance on weight-reduction measures for the F4U-1, FG-1, and F3A. [...] Corsair squadrons operating from land bases were authorized to remove catapult hooks, arresting hook, and associated equipment, which eliminated 48 pounds of unnecessary weight. [...] While there is no data to indicate to what extent these modifications where incorporated, there are numerous photos in evidence of USMC Corsairs, of various manufacturers and models, on islands in the Pacific without <b>tailhooks</b> installed.|$|R
25|$|In {{part because}} of its {{advances}} in technology and a top speed greater than existing Navy aircraft, numerous technical problems had to be solved before the Corsair entered service. Carrier suitability was a major development issue, prompting changes to the main landing gear, tail wheel and <b>tailhook.</b> Early F4U-1s had difficulty recovering from developed spins, since the inverted gull wing's shape interfered with elevator authority. It was {{also found that the}} Corsair's right wing could stall and drop rapidly and without warning during slow carrier landings. In addition, if the throttle were suddenly advanced (for example, during an aborted landing) the left wing could stall and drop so quickly that the fighter could flip over with the rapid increase in power. These potentially lethal characteristics were later solved through the addition of a small, -long stall strip to {{the leading edge of the}} outer right wing, just inboard of the gun ports. This allowed the right wing to stall at the same time as the left.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, the <b>Tailhook</b> Association {{established}} the annual [...] "Jig Dog" [...] Ramage Award {{to recognize the}} air wing-aircraft carrier team with the best performance as an integrated unit and excellence in Navy carrier operations.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a <b>tailhook</b> is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E
500|$|A new {{specification}} {{was issued}} as S.8/43 {{to cover the}} development of the Firebrand T.F. Mk III (B-45) with the [...] Bristol Centaurus VII radial engine. Two prototypes were converted from incomplete F Mk Is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered, completing the first batch of 50 aircraft. The first prototype flew on 21 December 1943, but construction of the new aircraft was very slow with the first flight not being made until November 1944. Most changes were related to the installation of the larger-diameter Centaurus engine, including air intakes for the carburetor and oil cooler in the wing-root extensions that formerly housed the engine's radiators. Spring-loaded trim tabs were also fitted to all control surfaces. Production aircraft after the first 10 were fitted with the improved Centaurus IX engine. The Mk III was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons. The new engine produced more torque than the Sabre, and rudder control was insufficient on takeoff with the full flaps needed for carrier use. Visibility while landing was very poor, the <b>tailhook</b> attachment to the airframe was too weak, and the aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at the stall while landing, so development continued to rectify these issues.|$|E
500|$|F-16N: The F-16N was {{an adversary}} {{aircraft}} {{operated by the}} U.S. Navy. [...] It {{is based on the}} standard F-16C/D Block 30 and is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-100 engine. However, the F-16N has a strengthened wing and is capable of carrying an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod on the starboard wingtip. [...] Although the single-seat F-16Ns and twin-seat (T)F-16Ns are based on the early-production small-inlet Block 30 F-16C/D airframe, they retain the APG-66 radar of the F-16A/B. In addition, the aircraft's 20mm cannon has been removed, as has the ASPJ, and they carry no missiles. Their EW fit consists of an ALR-69 radar warning receiver (RWR) and an ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser. The F-16Ns and (T)F-16Ns have the standard Air Force <b>tailhook</b> and undercarriage and are not aircraft carrier capable. [...] Production totaled 26 airframes, of which 22 are single-seat F-16Ns and 4 are twin-seat TF-16Ns. The initial batch of aircraft were in service between 1988 and 1998. At that time, hairline cracks were discovered in several bulkheads and the Navy did not have the resources to replace them, so the aircraft were eventually retired, with one aircraft sent to the collection of the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida, and the remainder placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB. [...] These aircraft were later replaced by embargoed ex-Pakistani F-16s in 2003. [...] The original inventory of F-16Ns were previously operated by adversary squadrons at NAS Oceana, Virginia; NAS Key West, Florida and the former NAS Miramar, California. [...] The current F-16A/B aircraft are operated by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada.|$|E
2500|$|Pardo {{then tried}} to use Aman's <b>tailhook</b> to push the plane, the Phantom having been {{originally}} designed as a naval aircraft for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, equipped with a heavy duty <b>tailhook</b> for landings aboard aircraft carriers. [...] Aman lowered his <b>tailhook</b> and Pardo moved behind Aman until the <b>tailhook</b> was against Pardo's windscreen. Aman shut down both of his J79 jet engines. The push worked, reducing the rate of descent considerably, but the <b>tailhook</b> slipped off the windscreen every 15 to 30 seconds, and Pardo would have to reposition his plane. Pardo also struggled with a fire {{in one of his}} own engines and eventually had to shut it down. In the remaining 10 minutes of flight time, Pardo used the one last engine to slow the descent of both planes.|$|E
2500|$|Should a <b>tailhook</b> become {{inoperative}} or damaged, sea-based aircraft {{have limited}} options: they can divert to shore runways, {{or they can}} be [...] "barricaded" [...] on the carrier deck by a net that can be erected.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, as jet {{aircraft}} began to operate from carriers, landing speeds and <b>tailhook</b> loads increased. The [...] US Navy [...] developed a test rig. It {{consisted of a}} car, guided by a concrete I-beam and propelled by two jet engines. At {{the end of a}} one-mile run the <b>tailhook</b> under test would engage an arresting wire. [...] The I-beam guide slowly widened to slow down the test car after it passed the arresting wire, in the event of failure. [...] Different aircraft weights and speeds are tested by loading steel plates on the unit. Further testing in 1958 used 4 Allison J33 jet engines.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>tailhook,</b> arresting hook, or {{arrester}} hook is a device {{attached to the}} empennage (rear) of some military fixed-wing aircraft. [...] The hook is used to achieve rapid deceleration during routine landings aboard aircraft carrier flight decks at sea, or during emergency landings or aborted takeoffs at properly equipped airports.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>tailhook</b> is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its free end {{flattened}} out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a <b>tailhook</b> is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, the Navy {{concluded}} that charges against Toussaint were exaggerated and that Rocha's allegations were either unsubstantiated or embellished. Naval officers involved in investigating the Toussaint case called the original decision to censure Toussaint a [...] "reverse Tailhook" [...] reaction, a reflexive and hasty attempt {{to prove that}} the Navy had learned its lesson from the 1991 <b>Tailhook</b> convention sexual harassment scandal. Toussaint is nevertheless still barred re-enlistment.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991, {{the casino}} hosted the U.S. Navy's <b>Tailhook</b> Association annual meeting. [...] During this gathering, alleged acts {{of sexual assault}} by Naval and Marine Corps {{officers}} {{took place in the}} hotel. [...] The Navy investigated the event; however, the initial accusations stood up and fueled a large scandal receiving wide media attention. [...] Responsibility included the entire chain of command, ultimately affecting the careers of over 300 pilots and 14 admirals, including Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Frank Kelso.|$|E
2500|$|The F-15N was a carrier-capable variant {{proposed}} in the early 1970s to the U.S. Navy {{as an alternative to}} the heavier and, at the time, considered as [...] "riskier" [...] technology program, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat. It did not have a long range radar or the long range missiles used by the F-14. The F-15N-PHX was another proposed naval version capable of carrying the AIM-54 Phoenix missile, but with an enhanced version of the AN/APG-63 radar on the F-15A. These featured folding wingtips, reinforced landing gear and a stronger <b>tailhook</b> for shipboard operation.|$|E
2500|$|On January 18, 1911, Eugene Ely landed his Curtiss pusher {{airplane}} on {{a platform}} on the armored cruiser USS Pennsylvania anchored in San Francisco Bay. Ely flew from the Tanforan airfield in San Bruno, California and landed on the Pennsylvania, {{which was the first}} successful shipboard landing of an aircraft. This flight was also the first ever using a <b>tailhook</b> system, designed and built by circus performer and aviator Hugh Robinson. Ely told a reporter: [...] "It was easy enough. I think the trick could be successfully turned nine times out of ten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to making}} an [...] "arrested landing", the pilot lowers the hook {{so that it}} will contact the ground as the {{aircraft}} wheels touch down. [...] The hook then drags along the surface until an arresting cable, stretched across the landing area, is engaged. [...] The cable lets out, transferring the energy of the aircraft to the arresting gear through the cable. [...] A [...] "trap" [...] is often-used slang for an arrested landing. [...] An aircraft which lands beyond the arresting cables is said to have [...] "boltered." [...] Occasionally, the <b>tailhook</b> bounces over {{one or more of the}} wires, resulting in a [...] "hook skip bolter." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the RAF {{contract}} {{had been}} cancelled, the Fury prototypes were completed {{and used for}} work in developing the Sea Fury {{as well as for}} the export market. The first Sea Fury prototype, SR661, first flew at Langley, Berkshire, on 21 February 1945, powered by a Centaurus XII engine. This prototype had a [...] "stinger"-type <b>tailhook</b> for arrested carrier landings, but lacked folding wings for storage. SR666, the second prototype, which flew on 12 October 1945, was powered by a Bristol Centaurus XV that turned a new, five-bladed Rotol propeller and did feature folding wings. Specification N.7/43 was modified to N.22/43, now representing an order for 200 aircraft. Of these, 100 were to be built at Boulton-Paul's Wolverhampton factory.|$|E
