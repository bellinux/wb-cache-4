25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within <b>the</b> <b>elastic</b> range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As <b>the</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. <b>The</b> <b>Elastic</b> modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine <b>the</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

This study also aims to determine and compare the force degradation of <b>the</b> <b>elastics</b> produced by four manufacturers at different extensions and at regular intervals. Materials and Methods: 5 / 16 inch lumen medium (Green) and ¼ inch lumen medium elastics (blue) of 4 companies were used. <b>The</b> <b>elastics</b> were stretched on a correx gauge to two times and three times the inner lumen diameter and at a fixed distance of 25 mm (dry test). <b>The</b> <b>elastics</b> were stretched at the specific distances and then immersed in artificial saliva and checked after 24 and 48 h (wet test). The data was analyzed using Student′s t-test. Results: Force degradation increases with time. Force degradation percentage values vary from 5 % to a maximum of 25 %. Conclusions: Thus from the study, the clinician can know the force degradation rates of elastics of two different sizes, manufactured by four different companies.

However, there are disagreements about this elastic protocol use according to the force degradation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate, in vitro, the forces generated by latex and synthetic elastics over time. Material and methods: Sample size of 840 elastics were used (420 latex and 420 synthetic), delivering medium strength (Dental Morelli®) with internal diameter of 1 / 8 ”, 3 / 16 ”, 1 / 4 ” and 5 / 16 ”. <b>The</b> <b>elastics</b> were randomly divided into 7 groups according to the time of the force measuring and immersed into distilled water at 37 °C.

25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member is less than <b>the</b> <b>elastic</b> {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond <b>the</b> <b>elastic</b> material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E
