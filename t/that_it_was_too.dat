5|$|After {{making a}} duck {{in the first}} innings of the match between Tasmania and the touring Australian side in March 1930, members of the Australian side advised Nash to change his stance, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> unorthodox to be successful. Nash ignored this advice and {{promptly}} scored 93 in the second innings of the match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891, Berkman {{learned that}} Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had {{canceled}} an American speaking tour on the basis <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> expensive for the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman was disappointed, the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin's stature in his eyes.|$|E
50|$|The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) {{circumcision}} policy What is its policy? {{has been}} criticised, both {{by those who}} believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> negative about the practice, and those who believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> positive. Hill has also criticised the Academy's circumcision information brochure for parents, arguing that the brochure is inadequate to persuade parents to avoid circumcision.|$|R

5000|$|Freud called free {{association}} [...] "this fundamental technical rule of analysis... We instruct {{the patient to}} put himself {{into a state of}} quiet, unreflecting self-observation, and to report to us whatever internal observations he is able to make" [...] - taking care not to [...] "exclude any of them, whether on the ground <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> disagreeable or too indiscreet to say, or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> unimportant or irrelevant, or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nonsensical and need not be said".|$|R
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under the grounds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> {{dangerous}} {{to continue the}} raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to land {{at the airport and}} it also became clear <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, the USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E
50|$|At one point, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> thought <b>that</b> {{this would}} become the main {{hospital}} for Christchurch, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> {{far away from the}} centre of the city.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015, Labour MP Chris Bryant {{called for}} Openreach to be split from BT, criticising the {{infrastructure}} and stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> slow to fix faults and install new lines.|$|R

5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early to analyze ridership; after {{the first week of}} service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force did {{possess an}} {{aircraft}} which had an all-weather capability, radar-guided bombing equipment, and awesome destructive potential – the B-52 Stratofortress. The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the big bombers (whose operations remained {{under the control}} of the Strategic Air Command) very far north of the DMZ, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> overt an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> close to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, {{as soon as the}} name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E

5|$|An avid {{baseball}} fan, Maxwell {{was among}} {{the founders of the}} Winnipeg Arena baseball club in 1908, and became the team's manager in 1912. At its peak, the team drew as many as 5,000 fans per game. As a player, manager or general manager, Maxwell was a member of eight Arena teams that won the Winnipeg city championship between 1908 and 1923. He was known for his quick, and often barbed, wit; His friends often told a story of an Arenas baseball game where, after failing to convince the umpire <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dark to play, Maxwell sent his players onto the field with lighted candles. In his later years, he served on the advisory board of the Winnipeg Goldeyes professional club.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Lincoln, the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners. Meanwhile, support for Louis's campaign was diminishing in France and he concluded {{that the war in}} England was lost. The French prince negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which he would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted and Henry's government would promise to enforce the Magna Carta. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion. In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces.|$|E

At the end of the story, Ujurak and Toklo meet up with Lusa.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Smyth sent {{an outline}} and rough {{draft of the}} report to Groves for {{approval}} in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> technical for general readers, {{did not mention the}} names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.|$|E

5000|$|CoDel is parameterless. One of the {{weaknesses}} in the RED algorithm (according to Jacobson) <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>too</b> difficult to configure, especially in an environment with dynamic link rates. CoDel has no parameters to set at all.|$|R
