5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> of the eyes, {{either directly or}} on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{shortage}} of <b>the</b> donor <b>cornea</b> in Japan, we are developing a poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel based keratoprosthesis. Minimum requirements for a keratoprosthesis include light transparency, non-toxicity, and nutrition and fluid permeability. Earlier clinical trials had frequently failed because corneal epithelial down growth occurred between <b>the</b> host <b>cornea</b> and <b>the</b> materials, and the materials were finally rejected from <b>the</b> host <b>cornea.</b> <b>The</b> major cause of this rejection is the weak adhesion between <b>the</b> host <b>cornea</b> and <b>the</b> prosthesis. In order to achieve the firm fixation of <b>the</b> artificial <b>cornea</b> to host cornea, composites of collagen-immobilized poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel with hydroxyapatite(PVA-HAp nano composites) were synthesized. The preparation method, characterization, {{and the results of}} corneal cell adhesion and proliferation on the composite materials were studied. The PVA-HAp nano composites were successfully synthesized. Chick embryonic keratocyto-like cells were well attached and proliferated on the PVA-HAp composites. This material showed potential for keratoprosthesis...|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity in the center of <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. <b>The</b> <b>cornea</b> is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye.

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the use of BioCornea, a fish scale-derived {{collagen}} matrix for sealing full-thickness corneal perforations in mini-pigs. Two series of experiments were carried out in 8 Lan-Yu and 3 Göttingen mini-pigs, respectively. A 2 mm central full thickness corneal perforation was made with surgical scissors and 2 mm trephines. The perforations were sealed immediately by suturing BioCornea to <b>the</b> wounded <b>cornea.</b> <b>The</b> conditions of each patched cornea were followed-up daily for 3 or 4 days. Status of operated eyes was assessed with slit lamp examination or optical coherence tomography (OCT).

5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against <b>the</b> <b>cornea,</b> damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. <b>The</b> <b>cornea</b> has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) experiments were reported which {{dealt with the}} question {{of the extent to which}} <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> of rabbits that have acquired a general immunity to syphilis after intratesticular inoculation share in the immune process.

40|$|Purpose: To {{establish}} a mouse model of adenovirus keratitis {{in order to}} study innate immune mechanisms in <b>the</b> adenovirus-infected <b>cornea.</b> Methods: Balb/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts were inoculated with human adenovirus (HAdV) serotypes 8, 19, or 37 and observed for cytopathic effect. Viral growth titers were performed, and apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay. Viral and host cytokine gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR in cultured Balb/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts and in <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> of virus-injected Balb/c mice. Western blot analysis was performed to detect cell signaling in <b>the</b> virus-infected <b>cornea.</b> Results: Only HAdV 37 induced cytopathic effect in mouse cells. Viral gene expression was limited, and viral replication was not detected. Apoptotic cell death in HAdV 37 -infected Balb/c cells was evident 48 and 72 hours postinfection (P <. 01). MCP- 1, IL- 6, KC, and IP- 10 mRNA levels were increased maximally by 8. 4, 9. 6, 10. 5, and 20. 0 -fold, respectively, at 30 to 90 minutes after HAdV 37 infection. Similar cytokine elevations were observed in <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> of Balb/c mice 4 hours after stromal injection of HAdV 37, when viral gene expression for the viral capsid protein IIIa was not detected. Western blot showed increased phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 at 4 and 24 hours after corneal infection. Conclusions: Despite limited viral gene expression, HAdV 37 infection of Balb/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts results in increased proinflammatory gene expression. A similar pattern of cytokine expression in <b>the</b> <b>corneas</b> of HAdV 37 -infected Balb/c mice suggests the mouse adenoviral keratitis model may be useful {{for the study of}} early innate immune responses in the adenovirus-infected corneal stroma.

5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to <b>the</b> <b>cornea.</b> In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>cornea</b> and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the electric arc, but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

40|$|BALB/c-derived athymic, nude (nu/nu) mice {{exhibited}} a heightened natural resistance to experimental corneal infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{when compared with}} their heterozygote (nu/+) littermates. Stereomicroscopic examination of the eyes of nu/nu mice 24 h after corneal trauma and topical bacterial application revealed slightly cloudy corneas (iris visible), whereas nu/+ littermate corneas were opaque (iris not visible). Nu/+ mice failed to resolve the infection, and endophthalmitis and shrinkage of the infected eye occurred in these mice within 2 weeks after experimental Pseudomonas infection, as in the parent BALB/c strain. However, nu/nu mice, similarly infected, resolved the infection within 24 h and never exhibited full corneal opacity or eye shrinkage.
