50|$|In 1789, an edict {{called for}} {{enclosure}} of common lands, {{to be distributed}} to the poor <b>in</b> <b>copyhold</b> <b>in</b> exchange for yielding some of their feudal rights. However, most peasants were too poor to buy their rights, and the laws could be interpreted and enforced only by local magistrates. As a result, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer. A rural proletariat was created.|$|R
50|$|Labor {{was in such}} a {{short supply}} that Lords were forced to give better terms of <b>tenure.</b> This {{resulted}} <b>in</b> much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called <b>copyhold</b> became prevalent <b>in</b> Europe. <b>In</b> <b>copyhold,</b> both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} then {{given to the}} men from Hvalba and Sandvík as Copyhold inheritance, against 40 Dkk <b>in</b> <b>copyhold</b> rent, and 10 Dkk every {{time there was a}} new owner. This money was in 1911 {{released}} with 1.000 Dkk, and thus did Lítla Dímun become the only privately owned island in the Faroes.|$|R
50|$|The Reform Act of 1832 {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies {{in addition to}} forty shilling freeholders franchise rights were extended to owners of land <b>in</b> <b>copyhold</b> worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50.|$|R
50|$|Melvyn Goldstein {{described}} Tibet {{as having}} had serfdom until 1959, {{but whether or}} not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy that qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested by other scholars. Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk, a Bhutanese civil servant, as having officially abolished serfdom by 1959, but he believes that less than or about 10% of poor peasants were <b>in</b> <b>copyhold</b> situations.|$|R
5000|$|In England, patrilineal ultimogeniture (i.e., {{inheritance}} by {{the youngest}} surviving male child) {{is known as}} Borough English, after its former practice in various ancient English boroughs. It was only enforced against those who died intestate and frequently—though not universally—also included the principle of inheritance by the deceased's youngest brother {{when there was no}} son. Less often, the practice was extended to the youngest daughter, sister, aunt, etc. Its origin is much disputed, although the Normans—who generally practiced primogeniture—considered it to be a Saxon legacy. A 1327 court case found it to be the practice of the English burgh at Nottingham, although not of that town's [...] "French" [...] district. The tradition was also found across many rural areas of England where lands were held <b>in</b> <b>tenure</b> by socage. It also occurred <b>in</b> <b>copyhold</b> manors <b>in</b> Hampshire, Surrey, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Sussex, where manorial custom dictated the form of inheritance to be ultimogeniture.|$|R
50|$|Present day Whitley Hall {{dates from}} the 1580s, however a {{dwelling}} was present on the site prior to this. This dwelling, known as Launder House was first recorded in a deed of 1406 when it was transferred from John Cartwright to William Robinson. Launder House was also known as Launderhouse, Lownderhouse and Loundhouse over the years, in 1487 it passed {{into the hands of}} Thomas Parker who held the property <b>in</b> <b>Copyhold</b> from the Lord of the Manor of Sheffield in return for ploughing and harvesting the land. The arrival of the Parkers at Launder House signalled the start of a 135-year association with the site over six generations.|$|R

30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the returns to {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector, but no significant return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation <b>tenure.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the strong return to formal sector tenure, we find significant returns to potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
