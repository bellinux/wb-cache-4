5000|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that an individual must have a [...] "Class 3 [...] " [...] in order to own NFA. An FFL is required as a prerequisite to become a Special Occupation Taxpayer (SOT): Class 1 importer, Class 2 manufacturer-dealer or Class 3 dealer in NFA, not an individual owner.

While most NFA firearms are bought from manufacturers and transferred to civilians through a dealer, many are made by the civilians themselves after filing a Form 1 and paying the $200 manufacturing tax. In some cases the manufacture is simple (i.e., using a pipe cutter to shorten a shotgun barrel), and sometimes quite complex.|$|E

30|$|Prior 2007, the {{residence}} regulation in Vietnam requires {{that anyone who}} {{are living in a}} place other than their permanent residence over 30  days have to register their temporary status with the destination police. However, changing residential status was very complicated process because the migrants had to obtain a letter of release from sending authorities where they hold their registration book. It is much more complicated and difficult to get a permanent registration in cities. Since 2007, when the new Law on Residence took effect, many requirements and conditions in obtaining permanent residency are eased. According to the new Law, the number of residence status are just two—temporary and permanent, and the Law also removed any legal conditionality of employment for registration (Marx and Fleischer 2010). To obtain a registration book in Hanoi or HCMC, people must live in the city for at least 2  years (based on temporary residential booklet record) and prove that they have a legal residence place (a house or an apartment). Although <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> books from one province to Hanoi or HCMCs is easier than before, it requires a complicated paperwork procedure (Demombynes and Vu 2016).|$|E

5000|$|The {{historical}} {{origins of}} the Torrens title are a matter of considerable controversy. Torrens himself acknowledged adapting his proposals from earlier systems <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>registration,</b> particularly the system <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> merchant ships in the United Kingdom. The Prussian mortgage legislation also served as an example. [...] James E. Hogg, in Australian Torrens System with Statutes (1905), has shown that Torrens derived ideas from many other sources and that he received assistance {{from a number of}} persons within South Australia. Stanley Robinson, in <b>Transfer</b> <b>of</b> Land in Victoria (1979) has argued that Ulrich Hübbe, a German lawyer living in South Australia in the 1850s, made the most important single contribution by adapting principles borrowed from the Hanseatic registration system in Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{adopted a}} similar system from 1870. The Land <b>Transfer</b> (Compulsory <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> Titles) Act 1924 brought {{most of the}} {{remaining}} land in the country under the Torrens system and by 1951 the register was considered complete, although small remnants of land may still exist under the deeds system. The Torrens system is now implemented by the Land Transfer Act 1952.|$|R
50|$|Torrens {{title is}} a system <b>of</b> land <b>registration,</b> in which a {{register}} of land holdings maintained by the state guarantees an indefeasible title to those included in the register.

Its main purpose is to simplify land transactions and to certify to the ownership of an absolute title to realty. It has become pervasive around the countries strongly influenced by Britain, {{especially those in the}} Commonwealth of Nations. It is named after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, GCMG (1814 - 31 August 1884), who was the third Premier of South Australia.|$|R
40|$|Described in {{this paper}} is the {{implementation}} and integration of an obstetrical medical record and database into an existing hospital information system. A unique feature of this system was the integration of existing data captured by the established hospital information systems with the newly implemented obstetrical database to form a complete patient data profile. This complete database integrated data from hospital functions such as demographic data obtained at patient registration, outpatient visits and tests, inpatient admission historical data, tests and procedures, newborn data and miscellaneous data required for birth registration. An important second feature was the utilization of physicians and nurses to enter the obstetrical data. This permitted immediate access to patient data from any hospital information system terminal, immediate retrieval for generating reports, and subsequently, ad hoc queries, statistical analysis and the electronic <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> birth <b>registration</b> data to the State Vital Statistics Registry...|$|R
