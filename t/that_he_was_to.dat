5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assume {{full command}} {{as soon as}} the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{part with}} trainer Mike McFarlane {{in favour of}} a permanent relationship with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny. The sprinter started the 100m season modestly, finishing third and fourth in|Modesto and Eugene, respectively. Chambers beat Montgomery in Glasgow in June, running a stadium record of 10.15s into a headwind, and qualified for the World Championships by winning the AAA trials.|$|E
5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told the fire-brigade officer on my {{authority}} as Home Secretary {{that the house was}} to be allowed to burn down and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Woodfull {{was promoted}} to open and his consistent performances in all conditions meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> play there {{for the rest of}} his career. Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3,000 first-class runs at an average of 67.|$|E
5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. A few Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day, mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support, and remained in the town during the night. The bridge at Zákány was destroyed later that day by sabotage units. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack {{to be carried out}} early on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night.

5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{answer to the}} Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|Barrons' position, as of February 2011, was as Assistant Chief of the General Staff. In May 2011 {{he became}} Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) in {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general. On 24 January 2013 it was announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be appointed Commander Joint Forces Command in April 2013. As of 2015, Barrons was paid a salary of between £175,000 and £179,999 by the department, making {{him one of the}} 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time. In April 2016, he handed over command of Joint Forces Command to General Sir Christopher Deverell.|$|E

5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|DeVeber did {{not serve}} long either as {{minister}} or Member of the Legislative Assembly: having received word <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be appointed to the Senate, he resigned from cabinet on March 1, 1906—exactly four months after his appointment—and from the legislature March 7. He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} title, Hill learned before the season's close <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be dropped by Williams {{in favour of}} Frentzen for the {{following}} season. Hill left Williams as the team's second most successful driver {{in terms of race}} victories, with 21, second only to Mansell. Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, making him one of only three people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer Henry Cooper and Mansell. Hill was also awarded the Segrave Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.|$|E

5|$|For their {{action on}} December 7, the U.S. War Department in Communiqué No. 19 on December 13, 1941, {{designated}} Taylor and Welch {{as the first}} two American heroes of World War II, and awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross on January 8, 1942. Taylor learned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> receive the award in mid-December after reading several newspapers. The award is the United States Army's second highest honor for valor {{in the heat of}} combat. Additionally, he later received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, and a Purple Heart for injuries he sustained. Both men were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but were turned down because they had taken off without orders.|$|E
5|$|In his 1324 Book of Marvels the Dominican missionary Jordanus, {{bishop of}} the Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon along the Malabar Coast of India, was the first known author to suggest that Ethiopia was the {{location}} of Prester John's kingdom. The Florentine merchant Antonio Bartoli visited Ethiopia from the 1390s until about 1404 {{when he returned to}} Europe with Ethiopian diplomats. This was followed by the lengthy stay of Pietro Rombuldo in Ethiopia from 1404 to 1444 and Ethiopian diplomats attending the ecumenical Council of Florence in 1441, where they expressed some vexation with the European attendees who insisted on addressing their emperor as Prester John. Thanks to the legacy of European medieval historiography, this belief persisted beyond the Late Middle Ages. For instance, the Portuguese missionary Francisco Álvares set out for Ethiopia in 1520 believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> visit the homeland of Prester John.|$|E
5|$|It {{was on the}} set of {{his first}} major film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, that Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called The Return of the Thin White Duke. He was also {{composing}} music on the understanding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.) Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.|$|E

5|$|Judge Cavanaugh granted summary {{judgment}} to the defendants on {{the freedom of}} speech claim based on their earlier motions, holding that Heffernan had not engaged in protected speech so his rights could not have been violated. In 2012, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Cavanaugh's ruling and remanded the case to him with instructions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> allow Heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider the facts from the jury trial when reconsidering the summary-judgment motions.|$|E
5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, Nedeljković {{received}} orders {{direct from}} Simović <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> defend the Bosanska Krajina region by holding the Germans along the Sava and Una, {{using a new}} 4th Army formed from {{the remnants of the}} 4th and 7th Armies. However, by this time the 4th Army amounted to about 250–300 infantry and 12 artillery pieces, divided between Bosanska Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi, Bihać and Prijedor. In order to delay the German advance, he was ordered to destroy all the bridges on the Una before withdrawing to a line on the Vrbas.|$|E
