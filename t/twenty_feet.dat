5|$|The woman's {{arms were}} {{swinging}} by her side, untied, while about <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> away swung {{the boy with}} his clothes partly torn off and his hands tided with a saddle string. The only marks on either body were that made by the ropes upon the necks. Gently swaying in the wind, the ghastly spectacle was discovered this morning by a negro boy taking his cow to water. Hundreds of people from Okemah and {{the western part of}} the county went to view the scene.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt was}} also {{made in the}} late 18th century {{to improve the quality}} of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of <b>twenty</b> <b>feet,</b> with <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a lamp post, gave off a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E
25|$|A second tarn to {{the east}} of Dow Crag stands in a small hollow below Brown Pike. This is Blind Tarn, so named because it has no visible inlet or outlet. About a hundred yards across and <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> deep, the tarn has a respectable {{population}} of trout. Whilst other theories are possible, it must be assumed they have been introduced for sport.|$|E

25|$|From 1858 to 1861, {{the state}} took over levee building, {{accomplishing}} it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent {{immigrants from the}} famine years who were struggling to get established. Before the American Civil War, the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached <b>twenty</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E

Each extended family was assigned a plot one-half rod wide and three rods long for each household member, then each family built their own dwelling. Supplies were brought ashore, and the settlement was mostly complete by early February.|$|E

25|$|The {{area to the}} {{northwest}} of Old Town, which {{had been in the}} separate town of Potomac, is popularly known as Del Ray, although that name properly belongs to one of many communities (including Hume, Mount Ida, and Saint Elmo's) in that area. The communities of Del Ray and St. Elmo's originated in early 1894, when developer Charles Wood organized them on a grid pattern of streets running north–south and east–west. Del Ray originally contained six east–west streets and five north–south. All were identical in width, except Mt. Vernon Avenue, which was approximately <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> wider. St. Elmo's, a smaller tract, was laid out in a similar pattern, but with only four east–west streets and one running north–south.|$|E

Mary Ford was driving the Buick convertible, which plunged {{off the side of}} a railroad overpass and dropped <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> into a ravine; they were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family. Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Presbyterian Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow. Their other option was amputation. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just under 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly {{a year and a half}} to recover.|$|E
25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light.

The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing.

25|$|The New County Jail {{layout and}} {{exterior}} finish clearly depict its {{use as a}} jail. It is a three story building of forty feet wide and <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> deep and across Main Street {{from the site of}} the old original wooden county jail. The construction of the building started in 1860, however it was not finished until 1867 due to the Civil War. The structure is made of brick and iron. It has at least two different brick types due to the long construction time. The prisoner jail cells with iron bars were on the top two floors. It also has an attic. The prisoner cells nor the second and third floors at all had any heat source. The first floor where the sheriff's office and quarters were have fireplaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1835 the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway (N) Act {{authorised}} {{the line}} to approach Newcastle to a terminus at Redheugh, on the south bank of the River Tyne, {{close to the end}} of the present-day New Redheugh Bridge. The Act also authorised a crossing of the Tyne there, giving rail access to the north shore quays. The river was shallow at this point, and the bridge would have been at a low level, only <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> above high water. The line would then have climbed to a terminus at the Spital, near Neville Street and the east end of the present-day Newcastle Central station. The climb was to be at a gradient of 1 in 22 and would have been operated by a stationary steam engine with rope haulage.|$|E
25|$|Santa Rosa Junior College art student Kim Wendy Allen, 19, {{was given}} a ride by two men on March 4, 1972, from her job at Larkspur Natural Foods to San Rafael. They last saw her at {{approximately}} 5:20 pm hitchhiking to school near the Bell Avenue entrance to Highway 101, northbound, carrying a large wooden soy barrel with red Chinese characters on it. Her body was found the following day down an embankment in a creek bed <b>twenty</b> <b>feet</b> off Enterprise Road in Santa Rosa. The victim had been bound at the ankles and wrists, raped and slowly strangled with a cord for an estimated thirty minutes. Semen was recovered from the body and a single gold loop earring was found at the site. Markings {{at the top of}} the embankment and a possible leg impression in the loam indicated the assailant likely slipped or fell while throwing or transporting the body. The two men who gave her a ride, one of whom {{was given a}}nd passed a polygraph test, were ruled out as suspects.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Twenty</b> <b>Foot</b> Drain was a {{main part}} of Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsey's {{drainage}} scheme, declared complete in 1638 and undone from 1642 onward, during the First English Civil War (1642-46). The Earl died at Edge Hill (23 October 1642). The imposition of the Lindsey level {{is typical of the}} many local grievances which led to that war. The fenmen had their way until the 1765 Act of Parliament set the Black Sluice scheme into being. The drain was incorporated into this as a less important feature and persisted into the 20th century, though the length at Twenty is now filled in. Its name appears as [...] "Old <b>Twenty</b> <b>Foot</b> Drain" [...] alongside Twenty Drove, in plans in the Exeter Estate book of 1826/27.|$|R
