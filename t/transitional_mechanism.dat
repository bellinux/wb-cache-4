It is established by Article 86 of the Constitution, which states that [...] "Every individual may claim legal protection before the judge, at any time or place, through a preferential and summary proceeding, for himself/herself or by whoever acts in his/her name, the immediate protection of his/her fundamental constitutional rights when the individual fears the latter may be jeopardized or threatened by the action or omission of any public authority." [...] The protection granted by the courts consists of an order enjoining others to act or refrain from acting, which may be challenged before a competent judge who shall transmit it to the Constitutional Court for possible revision.

The response to increasing temperature and pressure is sensitive to the type of model surfactant, with the sulfonate-stabilized particle, which is the most spherical, showing a weak temperature− pressure dependence, while the sulfurized alkyl phenol and salicylate-stabilized particles distort into a more spherical shape with increasing temperature and pressure. The atom−atom radial distribution functions of the core ions reveal consolidation of the calcium carbonate structure with increasing temperature and pressure. The simulations show that the nanoparticles adsorb onto the surface of water droplets through a water bridge <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanism,</b> in agreement with evidence from experimental studies.

All eastern and central North Pacific tropical cyclones from 1990 - 1993 are examined using 500 mb Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System streamline and isotach analyses, geostationary satellite imagery, and the tropical cyclone best track information. Application of the Systematic Approach to the eastern and central North Pacific requires modifications in the Environment Structure and TC-Environment transitional mechanisms: (1) A Low Synoptic Pattern is defined; and (2) a Weak Westerly Synoptic Region is defined in the Standard Synoptic Pattern. A four year climatology of Synoptic Patterns, Regions, Pattern/Regions, and transitions is developed. The Standard Pattern and Dominant Ridge Region are the most common because of the dominance of the subtropical ridge in eastern and central North Pacific tropical cyclone motion. However, two subregions in the subtropical ridge with different tilts account for track direction variations from south of west to north of west within the Standard Synoptic Pattern.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of verb agreement into epistemic marking: evidence from Tibeto-Burman Manuel Widmer, MA │ University of Berne │ Department of Linguistics DeLancey (2010, 2011) has recently {{argued that there}} are two main mechanisms that account for the loss of verb agreement in Tibeto-Burman languages: clausal nominalization (an old verb form inflected for person and number is replaced by a periphrastic construction consisting of a nominalized verb and a copula) and creolization (the agreement features 'person ' and 'number ' are lost due to intensive language contact). In my presentation, I will adduce evidence for a third mechanism which transforms the agreement feature 'person ' into a grammatical category that has been referred to as 'volitionality ' (DeLancey 1986), 'conjunct-disjunct ' (Hale 1980) or 'egophoricity' (Tournadre 1991).

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} reappraisal of {{transitional}} justice through {{the study of}} the nature and function {{of the rule of law}} it conveys. As originally conceived, transitional justice embraces a concept of the rule of law that is sensitive to the conditions of the political transition, in which law is caught in inexorable tensions between the past and the future. Yet, the increasing use of transitional justice to deal with armed conflicts and human rights violations irrespective of any political transition has created a conceptual and normative disorder, which leads to assimilating the use of <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to that of transitional justice. Should transitional justice apply to situations other than those of political transition? In what other transition-like situations is a sui generis concept of the rule of law justified? Can <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> be used in situations other than political transitions? The author analyzes these questions bearing in mind that an enlarged and unjustified use of transitional justice may render the concept of transitional justice analytically, descriptively, and normatively meaningless to law. The case study of Colombia shows the perverse effects of conceptual vagueness and brings to light the practical impacts that using an enlarged conception of transitional justice has upon the ordinary rule of law.

The PEO-PDA fibers in blue phase were obtained via photo-polymerization upon UV-light irritation. High mass ratios of PEO to PCDA, low polymer concentrations of spinning solution, and low injection speeds promoted fine fibers with small diameters and smooth surfaces. The colorimetric transition of the fibers was investigated when the fibers were heated at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 120 °C. A color switch from blue to red in the fibers was observed when the fibers were heated at temperatures greater than 60 °C. The color transition was more sensitive in the fibers made with a low mass ratio of PEO to PCDA due to high fraction of PDA in the fibers. The large diameter fibers also promoted the color switch due to high reflectance area in the fibers. All of the fibers were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and compared before and after the color change occurred.

40|$|Current {{thinking}} in major international development agencies construes community-based health insurance (CBHI) as a <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanism</b> to achieving universal coverage {{for health care}} in low-income countries. The policy link between CBHI and universal coverage is implicitly determined by the historical experience of mutual health insurance {{in countries such as}} Germany and Japan in the 19 th century, where the socioeconomic context was dramatically different to that of today’s much less successful schemes. This paper argues that the economic and health system frameworks employed in the analysis of CBHI have not taken into account context-dependent considerations such as goals, values and power. It is proposed that a critical engagement with social capital theories could contribute to our understanding of why CBHI schemes do not appear on course to develop according to the 19 th century precedent, achieving significant levels of population coverage in a sustainable way. A framework of social capital and economic development is used to organize and interpret existing evidence and information on CBHI. This process suggests that solidarity, trust, extra-community networks, vertical civil society links and state-society relations at the local level affect the possibility of success of CBHI. To this extent, {{it may be possible to}} talk of “social determinants of CBHI”. In order to align themselves to local community goals and values, CBHI schemes may need to actively foster certain types of vertical and horizontal bridging relations which could result in the evolution of structures and operations quite different to those proposed by current models of CBHI...|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} by {{scholars}} in demo-economics is the endogenous {{explanation of the}} demographic transition. In this paper, after having reviewed some main results of the recent literature on the subject, we discuss the insight that is provided by Solow-type neo-classical models once they are endowed with “transitional ” assumptions. Although Solow’s model is usually considered unable to explain the main facts of the transition (Chu 1998), {{we believe that it}} may still offer insight on fundamental aspects of modern growth, once we adequately endow it with hypotheses which are coherent with the demographic transition. As a first step we critically discuss the main avenues through which the typical patterns of the demographic transition may be embedded within the model of Solow, by distinguishing the rational perspective, in which the “transition ” follows from a maximising framework, from empirical and diffusionist approaches. The ensuing formulations of the <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanism</b> are embedded in simple neo-classical models, {{that can be used in}} order to study the main dynamical consequences of the transition on economic growth. The effects of the transition are subsequently analysed under both constant returns to scale (CRS), and decreasing returns to scale (DRS). DRS, which are typical of developing countries, lead to important differences, compared to CRS, which have not (with the exception of Strulik 1999), so far, been stressed in the literature on growth. Our overview and analyses give insight on important aspects such as: i) the onset of poverty traps, and the historically observed mechanisms of escape; ii) a more flexible notion of convergence which appears a powerful explanatory tool for empirically observed dynamics, iii) the need of DRS as unified models of long term historical growth. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{to determine whether it}} is important for the future development of legal systems in post-authoritarian or post-conflict states to confront the unjust past legacy of their judiciaries. In order to determine this, one has to assess the extent to which addressing the unjust past legacy of such judiciaries, by means of <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms,</b> has contributed to achieving the objectives of judicial reform is these contexts.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} analysis of the co-existence of different <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> in societies with a legacy ofhuman rights violations by the State. Traditionally truth commissions and criminal justice have been pitted as alternatives - truth versus justice - and extra-territorial or internationalised efforts {{have been seen as}} substitutes to domestic solutions. However, increasingly these tools have co-existed. The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission's conditional and individualised amnesty brought the co-existence and interaction of truth commissions and criminal trials into a sharp focus. The aim of this thesis is to examine whether the co-existence of such <b>transitional</b> justice <b>mechanisms</b> can complement and supplement each other, achieving more in regard to the needs of a transitional society than they wouid individually. Using the South African transition as the main focus, but supported by the study of a' representative selection of. other countries which adopted truth commissions as part of their domestic' solutions and those which were the subject of internationalised or extra-territorial efforts at accountability, this thesis. offers four propositions:- (a) that each mechanism is aimed at or capable of achieving different, but important, transitional needs; (b) that each mechanism cannot address all ofa transitional society's needs; (c) that combining mechanisms should therefore allow a society to meet a greater spectrum of its needs; and (d) such combinations in practice require careful planning, implementation and coordination, as the mechanisms can act in competition with each other, reducing each other's effectiveness and success. The thesis concludes with some deductions from the transitions studied for achieving complementary inter-action, which apply to domestic ~ombination of <b>transitional</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and co-ordination between any extra-territorial accountability and domestic efforts. These conclusions should be pertinent and could contribute to the International Criminal Court's future work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
