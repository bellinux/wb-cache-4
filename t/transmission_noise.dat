40|$|Abstract—The key {{technical}} challenge {{in making a}} full-duplex radio is self-interference cancelation (SIC). The self-interference received by a full-duplex radio has two major components: one corresponds to an information-carrying waveform meant for a remote radio and the other corresponds to the noise generated from the transmit chain of the full-duplex radio. The transmission signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a typical radio is only about 30 dB. This severely limits the performance of any SIC methods which ignore the <b>transmission</b> <b>noise.</b> None of the previously known digital or hybrid methods for SIC has any built-in mechanism to handle the <b>transmission</b> <b>noise.</b> In this paper, we present a new analog-digital hybrid method whose performance is no longer limited by the <b>transmission</b> <b>noise.</b> This method also involves a blind system identification and equalization algorithm for finding the optimal parameters of the cancelation filter.
