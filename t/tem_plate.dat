40|$|We applied AFM {{to study}} biomolecular wires, both out of {{interest}} in thei r biological functions and {{in the framework of}} nanotechnology based fabr ication. We have focused on two different kinds of protein wires: Insuli n fibrils and microtubules. Microtubules are an important constituent of the cytoskeleton and fulfill multiple vital functions in the cell. Insu lin fibrils on the other hand are amyloid fibrils without a clear biolog ical role, but with intriguing polymerization properties that make them an interesting model system for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Both p rotein wires are formed by a self-assembly process and have robust struc tural properties, which make them interesting candidates to act as a <b>tem</b> <b>plate</b> for the formation of metal wires. A first part of this thesis deals with the characterization of the compl ex substructure of insulin fibrils. The multipathway polymerization proc ess of insulin results in fibrils that can be divided into two groups, e ach characterized by a different structural motif: Helical fibrils compo sed of protofilaments, and chains of rod-like segments. We observed both types of structures with AFM in great detail. The helical fibrils exist with a large variety of periodicities and heights, indicating that they can be formed by different numbers of protofilaments. These protofilame nts cannot directly be distinguished in the fibrils and their number has to be inferred from the height of the fibril. By studying defective hel ical fibrils that have frayed into their individual protofilaments, we w ere able to distinguish the individual protofilaments, confirming the fi bril substructure. This led to the observation that the protofilaments t hat constitute a helical fibril exhibit a periodicity themselves, which is not observed in protofilaments that are not involved in the formation of a helical fibril. The assembly of the fibrils was observed to occur in a hierarchical way: Two protofilaments twist around each other to for m a pair, and two pairs then twist around each other to form a 4 -filamen t fibril. Another important assembly pathway leads to insulin fibrils consisting o f rod-like segments that are associated in a head to tail fashion. We we re able to elucidate this polymerization pathway with high-resolution AF M. Strikingly, all of the rod-like segments are uniform in size within o ne fibril, but differ greatly in size between different fibrils. This in dicates the importance of lateral interactions in the nucleation of cons ecutive segments: A once formed segment is involved in the formation of more segments that have similar shapes and dimensions. Some of the segme nts reveal a substructure that consists of a narrow lateral protrusion t owards one side {{along the length of the}} segment. Remarkably, this protru sion was observed on segments in different fibrils, independent of their size, implying that the substructure of the segments is a characteristi c of this insulin polymerization pathway. The fibrils that are polymerized from B-chain insulin are quite differen t from the complex polymorphism of fibrils polymerized from native insul in. Our measurements revealed two types of fibrils: Small, simple filame nts with a height around 2. 2 nm and thick, helical fibrils with heights between 5. 5 and 8. 0 nm. These two fibril types do not seem to interact w ith each other and we could not observe any substructure in the larger f ibrils. This indicates that, in contrast to the case of native insulin f ibrils, the thick helical fibrils are not composed of the thin filaments. Instead, both fibril types may result from different polymerization pa thways, whose occurrence depends on insulin concentration and the presen ce of a denaturating agent. Microtubules and their interaction with MAPs were the subject of a fruit ful collaboration with the Laboratory of Experimental Genetics and Trans genesis, the Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and the Laboratory of Biomolecular Dynamics. In the framework of this collaboration, we succe eded in direct visualization with AFM of microtubules conjugated with no rmal and mutated forms of the protein tau in different phosphorylation s tates. These different tau forms were made available and their binding t o microtubules was tested. Subsequently, the microtubule-tau complexes w ere deposited on substrates that are suitable for AFM, and then imaged t o observe directly how the tau is attached to the microtubule walls. The effect of hyperphosphorylation of tau was evident, as the massive detac hment of tau from the microtubules resulted in unfolding of the microtub ules and damage to their structure. Our AFM images also elucidate the me chanism behind the good binding of the mutant tau-P 301 L to microtubules. This binding was rather unexpected because the P 301 L-mutation is known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We observed that the mutat ed tau appears to bind to the microtubule walls in the form of large, so lid tau aggregates. Our direct visualization with AFM of individual micr otubule-tau complexes thus proved to be complementary to more standard b iochemical characterization techniques and provided new insights in the interactions of microtubules with the protein tau. Another important part of this thesis was related to the metallization o f protein wires. Our approach to metallization essentially consisted of two steps: First, metal particles with sizes of a few nanometers were at tached to the walls of the protein template. In a second step these smal l particles were enlarged by silver enhancement. We explored several way s to attach the initial metal particles to the protein template, includi ng direct attachment of preformed gold colloids and electroless plating by reduction of silver or palladium ions. Gold colloids with sizes of 10 nm were found to readily attach to insulin fibrils and microtubules. Go ld particles do, however, not bind to the substrates. We observed that i nsulin fibrils or microtubules which are densely covered with gold collo ids adhere badly to the substrate. Uncovered stretches of the biomolecul e are required to anchor the metal-biomolecule complex to the substrate, limiting the density of gold colloids on the template that can be achie ved. The best results were obtained by incubating insulin fibrils with A g+ ions, followed by their immobilization on a substrate and subsequent application of a NaBH 4 reduction bath. After optimalization of the param eters of the reaction, this procedure resulted in fibrils that are dense ly covered with silver particles with sizes of a few nanometers. Our met allization technique proved very efficient in comparison with other appr oaches reported in literature. The stabilization provided by the substra te during the reduction process ensures a high yield of densely covered, individual fibrils. High resolution TEM images, provided by the EMAT gr oup, University of Antwerp, revealed that the silver particles are organ ized in a helical way. This indicates that the metal particles bind to t he insulin fibrils at specific binding sites and adopt the helical struc ture of the template. The arrangement of the silver particles was verifi ed with circular dichroism, an optical technique that is sensitive to ch iral structures. Upon irradiation with UV light, the metallized insulin fibrils displayed a circular dichroism band at wavelengths just below 40 0 ~nm. This wavelength region is characteristic for the light absorption by small silver particles in optical experiments. The presence of the ci rcular dichroism band nicely confirms the helical arrangement of the sil ver particles. Next, the insulin fibrils that were densely covered with small silver pa rticles were enlarged further by application of silver enhancer. This re sulted in fibrils that are coated with a silver layer that is about 50 n m thick, which is continuous as far as can be judged from AFM images. Ho wever, our electrical conductance measurements only reveal a very poor c onductivity of the metallized fibrils. Two typical results were obtained with the conductance measurements: Next to fibrils that exhibited a lin ear behavior with resistance values of several GOhm at low voltages, als o fibrils with asymmetric I-V characteristics and a zero current plateau around zero bias were observed. These results indicate that the silver enhancement is not sufficient to enlarge the particles to form continuous wires. Charging effects of the silver particles may explain the nonlinear shape of the I-V curves. Also, contamination and oxidation effects at the intergrain boundaries may c omplicate the conductivity of the chains of silver particles. The metall ized fibrils proved to be very sensitive to changes caused by currents t hat can flow at high voltages and to voltage peaks during the connection of the sample to large contact pads by ultrasonic wire-bonding. Thermal ly induced displacement of the silver particles could be observed with A FM after the conductance measurements. Increasing the silver enhancement time might solve these problems, but will lead to considerably thicker and more irregular wires. Reports in literature suggest that a better so lution may be provided by the application of gold enhancement to the sil ver particles, which covers them with a gold layer that is insensitive t o oxidation effects. Another interesting possibility to probe the electrical properties of th e metallized fibrils is to the study the response of the wires to voltag es applied at different frequencies (10 kHz < f < 10 MHz). A pplying an oscillating voltage to the wires induces displacement current s, which are much less hampered by a finite distance between the Ag nano particles or by oxidation of the interfaces between adjacent particles. First results indicate that the capacitance of the wires can be determin ed as a function of frequency. A typical value for the capacitance C is 3. 8 pF. Using the frequency dependent capacitance, the dielectric consta nt of the material separating the particles can be determined, providing new interesting insights in the electrical properties of the biotemplat ed nanowires. Outlook Several obstacles complicate the use of metal-biomolecule hybrid structu res for nanotechnological applications. Insulin fibril fit the requireme nt of a thin self-assembling template as they have a diameter of a few n anometers and are formed through a simple polymerization process. We dem onstrated that the fibrils can be very densely covered with metal partic les by electroless plating, while the fibrils stay intact and can be ret rieved in large numbers. The limiting factor seems to be the further tre atment that is needed to turn the wires, which essentially consist of a chain of silver nanoparticles, into a continuous wire with a good conduc tance. Extensive silver enhancement and gold toning will be needed to ob tain wires with a low resistance, resulting in a considerable increase o f the wire diameter. The dimensions of the nanostructures that can be produced with this biot emplating methods are in the same range as the dimensions that can be ac hieved with state-of-the-art lithographic techniques. Another valuable n on-biological approach to the production of nanoscale electronic compone nts is offered by carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes possess unique elec trical and structural properties that potentially make them usefull in n anotechnology and nanoelectronics. Depending on subtle variations in the ir structure, they can be metallic or semiconducting. Therefore, the use of biomolecules as a template to grow continuous meta l wires that can be used as interconnects between functional components may be less favorable. Instead, the main benefit of using biomolecules l ies in the creation of nanodevices by exploiting the self-assembly and n atural functions of proteins. Biomolecules do show great promise because of their ability to assemble small yet regularly sized and spaced structures that can act as a templa te to build up structures from inorganic materials, which cannot self as semble themselves. They may also be applied for the production of device s that consist of many nanosize components that have to be precisely ord ered and connected, something which has proven difficult so far with top -down approaches, but which Nature may achieve with ease. An example is the use of protein cages: Three-dimensional protein structures with a ce ntral, enclosed hollow space (See review by J. Heddle). Inside these pro tein cages, a metal or semiconductor particles can be formed, which can function as a quantum dot and allow to fabricate extremely small electro nic components. Protein cages have been used to control the deposition o f inorganic particles on a surface. On the other hand, protein rings hav e been used to arrange metal particles in a well-ordered 2 D array on a s urface by exploiting the natural interactions between the rings. The con struction of a prototype MOS capacitor was demonstrated by arranging pro tein rings filled with gold nanoparticles on a surface. In this respect, the helical organization of the silver particles on the insulin templat e that we observed may as well offer interesting possibilities. The application of high resolution TEM and electron tomography, in combi nation with AFM and optical techniques, offers excellent opportunities t o study the three-dimensional morphology of metal-protein hybrid structu res with unprecedented resolution. When combining these experimental tec hniques with simulations and ab initio calculations of the affinity for metallization of the different functional groups at the biomolecule surf ace, we may achieve a thorough understanding relevant to the mechanisms that govern the growth of such systems. This knowledge can be used to op timize the metallization process so that the properties of the metallic nanostructures may become controllable. In this framework, also biomolec ules different from insulin fibrils, such as peptide nanotubes, may be u sed as a template for metallization with different inorganic materials, including Pd, Pb and Au. This will allow us to select the metal-biomolec ule hybrid system with the most potential for further study, in order to eventually obtain a system that is ready for application in nanoelectro nics. status: publishe...|$|E

Defense Nuclear Agency (now Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA) was tasked with the responsibility to develop a software tool to address the requirement. Based on extensive technical background, DTRA developed the Hazard Prediction Assessment Capability (HPAC). For over a decade HPAC addressed the users requirements through on-site training, exercise support and operational reachback. During this period the HPAC code was iteratively improved, but the basic architecture remained constant until 2002. In 2002, when the core requirements of the users started to evolve into more net-centric applications, DTRA began to investigate the potential of modifying their core capability into a new design architecture. This thesis documents the requirements, analysis, and architectural design of the newly prototyped architecture, Integrated Weapons of Mass Destruction Toolset (IWMDT).

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) allows the imaging of objects from materials sciences and biology with {{a resolution of}} a few nm to a few Å. Biological systems can be reconstructed in 3 D under physiological conditions using cryo TEM. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of individual images hampers resolution. Weak-phase objects such as native biological samples can be visualized only by phase contrast, which is generated in conventional TEM by defocusing. The defocus technique yields weak contrast and incomplete transfer of object information, which makes reconstruction difficult. Therefore, generating contrast by placing a phase plate in the back focal plane of the objective lens is desirable. This allows for artefact-free imaging of weak-phase objects with strong contrast. For <b>TEM,</b> phase <b>plates</b> have been realised only {{in the form of}} a thin carbon film which causes loss of signal and resolution. This work presents the first technical implementation of an electrostatic (Boersch) phase <b>plate</b> for <b>TEM</b> and gives the experimental proof-of-principle for this device. The Boersch phase plate generates maximum phase contrast while avoiding resolution loss. It consists of a miniaturised electrostatic einzel lens that shifts the phase of the unscattered wave. Obstruction effects are minimised by optically magnifying the focal plane. The advancement to an entirely obstruction-free phase plate is outlined which generates pseudo-topographic (Hilbert) contrast. The enhancement of electron-microscopic reconstruction by such a Hilbert phase plate is demonstrated for electron tomography of unstained cell sections...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} our general discussion of Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs), which has been carried on {{during the first two}} Ultra-Wideband, Short-Pulse Electromagnetics conferences. IRAs are a class of antennas that consist of a TEM feed section and either a lens or reflector to focus the aperture field. We summarize here much of the more recent information, including new antenna designs, new calculation methods, and an optimization of the impedance of the lens IRA. First, we explore a wide variety of new IRA designs that include two reflecting or refracting surfaces. By using two surfaces, one can achieve considerable additional flexibility in design. This flexibility allows very compact designs, and also allows additional choices of feed impedance. Next, we consider the optimal feed impedance for long TEM horns and lens IRAs. We consider both <b>TEM</b> horns whose <b>plates</b> are flat, and whose plates are confined to a circular arc. We also consider both infinite apertures and circular apertures of finite radius.
