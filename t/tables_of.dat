5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> {{the motions}} of Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet.

Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, Alexis Bouvard {{published}} astronomical <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> {{the orbit}} of Neptune's neighbour Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction. In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on {{the orbit of}} Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.|$|E
5|$|In Glasgow, he {{was trained}} in the {{emerging}} science of statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training. For example, he used statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners, who wrote that blacks were inferior and that slaves were better off than free blacks or white urban laborers. To do this, he drew up statistical <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> data from the census.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Korean War, between 1953 and 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main {{garrison}} was Camp Casey, South Korea.

In 1963, the division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. On 2 April 1971, the division and its brigades returned to the United States and inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} table {{gives an}} idea of the complexity of the higher homotopy groups even for spheres of dimension 8 or less. In this table, the entries are either the trivial group 0, the infinite cyclic group Z, finite cyclic groups of order n (written as Zn), or direct products of such groups (written, for example, as Z24times&Z3 or Z22 = Z2times&Z2). Extended <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> homotopy groups of spheres are given {{at the end of the}} article.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms). Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E

In practice, units used the World War I-era 37 mm M1916 for training. They were equipped with the M3 (four in each platoon) before {{being sent to the}} frontline. Additionally, a divisional special weapons battalion was equipped with self-propelled 37 mm GMC M6.|$|E
5|$|Early {{statutes}} {{declared the}} school was to instruct 90 sons of Norwich citizens, though it has since grown to a total enrolment of approximately 1,020 pupils. For most of its history it was a boys' school, before becoming co-educational in the sixth form in 1994 and in every year group in 2010. The school is divided into the Senior School, which has around 850 pupils aged from 12 to 18 across eight houses, and the Lower School, which was established in 1946 and has around 170 pupils aged from seven to 11. The school educates the choristers of the cathedral, with which the school has a close relationship and which is used for morning assemblies and events throughout the academic year. In league <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> British schools it is consistently ranked first in Norfolk and Suffolk and amongst {{the highest in the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
