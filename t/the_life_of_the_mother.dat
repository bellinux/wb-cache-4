5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{their general}} {{opposition}} to abortion, fundamentalist churches {{that include the}} conservative evangelical, Non-denominational, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal movements, {{do not have a}} consensus doctrine regarding abortion. While these movements hold in common that abortion (when there is no threat to <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother)</b> is a form of infanticide, there is no consensus as to whether exceptions should be allowed when the mother's life is in mortal danger, or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Some argue that the lives of both the mother and fetus should be given equal consideration, in effect condemning all abortion including those performed to save <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother.</b> Others argue for exceptions which favor <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother,</b> perhaps including pregnancies resulting from cases of rape or incest.|$|E

40|$|Three high {{temperature}} gear materials were evaluated using spur gear surface fatigue tests.

25|$|When {{surveyed}} in 1999 on his political positions by Project Vote Smart, Griffith {{indicated that he}} supports legalized abortion in the first trimester and to save <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mother,</b> while favoring the restriction of abortion through parental notification laws and prohibition of partial-birth abortion. Griffith's voting record has generally been consistent with his 1999 survey, voting in favor of restrictions on late term abortions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, while voting against bills that would restrict first-term abortions. In 2010 Griffith voted to restrict state funding of abortions, and to require abortion clinics to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for fetal stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|In his {{legislative}} races, Honaker {{was supported}} by the Wyoming National Right to Life Committee.

Honaker explains that his activity post-dated the United States Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, a 1989 case from Missouri. The court then had impliedly invited legislation regarding abortion from the states. In the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, the court closed the door on such proposals. More than forty states considered abortion legislation during that time.|$|E
