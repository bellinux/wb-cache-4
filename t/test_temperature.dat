Both steels were processed by powder metallurgy methods, involving gas atomization and hot isostatic pressing at 180 MPa for 2 h at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C. The microstructure of the consolidated tool steels consist of a ferrite matrix and carboboride M 23 (C,B) 6 particles. The 1 wt. %C- 1 wt. %B tool steel contains, in addition, small particles of vanadium carbide and vanadium boride. An ultimate tensile strength of 300 MPa at 700 °C was obtained in the 1 wt. %C- 1 wt. %B tool steel. At <b>testing</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the austenitic phase, a stress exponent of about 5 was obtained and the activation energy for creep {{was related to the}} activation energy for iron self-diffusion in austenite.
