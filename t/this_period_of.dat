5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time Venus and Earth have {{returned}} to very nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.|$|E

5|$|After the Aktions in late 1941, {{no further}} {{large-scale}} deportations or other massacres {{took place in}} the Vilnius Ghetto. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> calm lasted throughout 1942 and early 1943. During this period, Gens' department oversaw the three police precincts the ghetto had been divided into, as well as the ghetto's prison. The police force in early 1942 had about 200 policemen.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman defeat, {{the fleet}} was laid {{up at the}} Golden Horn and left largely {{unattended}} for the following twenty years. During <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major warships of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other warships attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} as Carroll was in business, however, {{he and his}} wife experienced many personal losses throughout <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> <b>Of</b> the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August is {{the annual}} American celebration of Labor Day, the only holiday weekend during <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> <b>Of</b> all the year's holiday {{weekends}} it is reliably the weakest in terms of movie box office, with the top grosser for the weekend being the 2007 Rob Zombie-directed reimagining of Halloween, at $30.5 million. The Sixth Sense, then in its fourth week, is a close second after pulling in $29 million in 1999; in a distant second for opening weekends is yet another horror film, 2012's The Possession with $21.1 million.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1861, a {{sequence}} of events led to the independence and unification of Italy (except for Venetia, Rome, Trento and Trieste, known as Italia irredenta, which were united {{with the rest of}} Italy in 1866, 1870, and 1918 respectively); <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> Italian history is known as the Risorgimento, or resurgence. During this period, the tricolore became the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence.|$|E

5|$|By 9 April, the {{pressure}} was decreasing on the New Zealand positions as the Germans shifted their offensive north to the area around Armentières. While {{the bulk of the}} New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the brunt of the renewed German attacks. Casualties for <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division's personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} affected by <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> sudden and profound decay, {{if only because}} of the sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E

Some of <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> his career was documented in the Discovery Channel program Inside Pro Wrestling School. He held the UPW Heavyweight Championship for 27 days in April 2000. Cena wrestled for the UPW until March 2001. Cena returned to UPW for one night in 2003, losing to Frankie Kazarian by disqualification.|$|E

5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The {{last quarter of the}} 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile.

The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E

It was during <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E

5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup.

5|$|From the Nore, Bellerophon {{proceeded}} to the Downs {{and joined the}} fleet stationed there. She spent three weeks in the roadstead, exercising her guns, before moving to Spithead. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and Bellerophon was sent to Sheerness in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the Russian Armament in 1791, but when <b>this</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> tension also passed without breaking into open war, Bellerophon {{was sent back to}} Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
