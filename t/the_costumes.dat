Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, <b>the</b> <b>costumes</b> were of less importance than make-up and the actor's nuances.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} <b>the</b> use of <b>costumed</b> interpreters at museums. Firstly the thesis {{examines}} how extensivethe use of historical costumes is in Sweden, {{along with some}} international comparisons. Later on the differentways that the clothes are used is examined, and <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> {{as a resource for}} learning is discussed. In the lastpart of the thesis the “function” of <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> is examined. Two different theories are used to study the costumedinterpreters: performance-theories and communication-theories. The different methods used in the thesisincludes studies of literature, web pages, reports and conducting interviews with museum staff concerned with clothing. The result of the thesis is new perspectives on <b>costumed</b> interpreters, where <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> is seen as an activesubject that creates the presence of history. <b>The</b> <b>costume</b> also helps <b>the</b> staff from the museum to control the visitorsby giving the interpreter authority and making him/her a link to <b>the</b> history. <b>The</b> <b>costume</b> also changes thebehavior of the wearer, even if the person isn´t a part of an educational role-play at the moment. This can be seenas the wearer leaving his/her private self and entering a professional role. <b>The</b> <b>costume</b> is a support and a façadefor <b>the</b> interpreter. <b>The</b> <b>costume</b> as a resource for learning is also examined and <b>the</b> <b>costume</b> is an excellent toolfor starting a dialogue with <b>the</b> visitors. <b>The</b> <b>costume</b> is an introduction to discuss clothing, fashion and technicalinnovations, but gender, ethnicity, class and other subject can also be discussed through <b>the</b> <b>costume.</b> <b>The</b> possibilitiesfor the interpreter depends on the clothes, but also the interpreters and the visitors knowledge, relation toclothes and the selection of information and stories that is made. Gerbners model for communications is re-madeto describe the communication between the clothes, the wearer and the visitor. The thesis ends with a summaryand suggestions on continue...|$|R

5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner.

5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of <b>the</b> <b>costumes</b> were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had {{spent a good deal of}} time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and <b>the</b> <b>costumes</b> worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E
