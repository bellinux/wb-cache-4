25|$|These {{manufacturers}} offer special {{models for}} fishing {{that are designed}} and accessorized for this sport, including specially designed hatches, built-in coolers & rod holders, gps receivers and equipment mounts. Other accessories include live wells, anchor trolleys and running lights. Specially designed fishing kayaks usually have designs {{similar to those of}} recreational sit-in and sit-on-top kayaks characterized by very wide beams (up to 36 inches) that increase lateral stability. The increases stability allows for the angler to stand up and fish on the kayak. These kayaks provide a considerable space for storage inside their hulls which allow the angler to stow rods, fishing gear, batteries for fish finders, extra paddles, anchors, and wheels to tow the kayak from vehicle to the water. The cutouts molded into the top of the kayaks are well-suited to hold milk crates with additional supplies. Some anglers equip their fishing kayaks with outriggers to further increase stability. In recent years people have begun using kayaks for fly fishing, most models suited for upright fly casting include upright braces <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> safely stand up.|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited {{was placed}} in direct {{competition}} with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "1995 {{is going to be}} a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass [...] is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others." [...] Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, [...] "The games that sell big are the ones <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> blow stuff up, so, if anything, that could be a problem for Flight Unlimited." [...] Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent [...] "many late nights" [...] on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called [...] "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath [...] "fully [...] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator".|$|E
