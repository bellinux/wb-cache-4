5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half <b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (<b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (<b>the</b> <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E
