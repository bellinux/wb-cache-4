[...] In early November 1875, Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Division of the Missouri, and Brigadier General George Crook, commander of the Department of the Platte, were called to Washington, D.C. to meet with Grant and several members of his cabinet to discuss the Black Hills issue. They agreed that the Army should stop evicting trespassers from the reservation, thus opening {{the way for the}} Black Hills Gold Rush. In addition, they discussed initiating military action against the bands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come to the Indian agencies for council. Indian Inspector Erwin C. Watkins supported this option. [...] "The true policy in my judgement," [...] he wrote, [...] "is to send troops against them in the winter, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> <b>better,</b> and whip them into subjection." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: ...After {{returning}} from a chigger-infested area, launder the field clothes in soapy, hot water (125°F.) ....As soon as possible, take a good hot bath or shower and soap repeatedly. The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (<b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> treatment, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>the</b> results.)....|$|R
