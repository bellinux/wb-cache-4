40|$|A {{system is}} {{proposed}} in order <b>to</b> <b>split</b> <b>a</b> multi-dimensional signal into N sub-bands, {{which are then}} subsampled by N.

Main features are a good bandpass characteristic of the channels, automatic aliasing cancellation and spectral invariance of the overall system. The one dimensional case, known as the quadrature mirrir filter (QMF, [1]), is generalized for both the separable and the non-separable case. A parallel implementation, based on pseudo-QMF filters, is presented as <b>an</b> efficient way <b>to</b> <b>split</b> <b>a</b> signal into equal sub-bands...|$|R
