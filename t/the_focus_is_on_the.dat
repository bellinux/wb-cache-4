5|$|The 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a holistic approach to the development of pupils and support for their families.|$|E
5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E

25|$|Haruki Murakami's 1995 novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle deals greatly with Manchukuo {{through the}} {{character}} of Lieutenant Mamiya.

While the period covered in these recollections extends over many years, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final year of the war and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

25|$|Article 49(1) of the Constitution, {{which is}} the {{provision}} governing by-elections in Singapore today, does not stipulate a time limit within which a vacant parliamentary seat must be filled. During the 2008 parliamentary debate, the Prime Minister asserted that he had discretion to decide when a by-election should be called, if at all. He described the legal framework as his Government understood it as facilitating the efficient execution of the Government's policies, because political parties rather than individual candidates exist as the fundamental elements of the government. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> party delivering its promises, and because a vacancy in Parliament does not affect a party's mandate to rule, the vacancy need not be filled before the next general election. In 2013, the Court of Appeal held in Vellama d/o Marie Muthu v. Attorney-General (2013) {{that this was an}} incorrect interpretation of Article 49(1).|$|E
25|$|The Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) {{is located}} in the former monastery of San Agustin. The {{building}} {{is considered one of the}} major Baroque works of art in Mexico, built in the 18th century and is attributed to Ignacio Mariano de la Casa It has a facade of cantera stone in which an image of a crucified Christ is surrounded by grapevines. The niches around the main portal contain images of Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Sorrows, Saint Monica and others. Its cupola contains life-sized images of angels, but its bell tower was never finished. The monastery was occupied by Augustine friars starting in 1743 and is considered to be one of the finest Baroque monasteries in the Americas. Its fame as such comes from the decoration of the arches and columns that surround the inner courtyard. On the ground floor, there are faces with fierce expressions, while those on the upper floor have more serene expressions. Surrounding both sets of faces are chains linking the images. The museum contains one of the most important collections of colonial-era art and is organized by painting style. Some European works are here but <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> painters of New Spain, including some of the most famous. The museum also sponsors temporary exhibits, theatrical works, as well as literary, photography and musical events.|$|E

500|$|John Pierce also {{regarded}} Dragon's Egg as {{hard science}} fiction at its best, while Forward's later novel Martian Rainbow (1991) was the genre at its worst. Both novels have cardboard human characters, {{but this does}} not matter in Dragon's Egg, where <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deeper personalities of the cheela characters. The novel even makes readers care about the fate of an unsympathetic cheela ruler, whose rejuvenation [...] treatment fails catastrophically. Pierce wrote that the best works of this genre create a literary experience, but one of an unusual kind. Instead of offering a metaphor for a reality the reader already recognizes, they create new realities in which the reader is caught up.|$|E
500|$|The High Court will enquire {{whether all}} {{considerations}} relevant to an act or decision {{have been taken}} into account by the decision-maker, and irrelevant ones ignored.

Rather, <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reasoning process by which the decision was reached. However, in the UK context it has been noted that [...] "case law on relevant considerations can sometimes take the courts to the fringes of difficult social and economic choices and that (arguably) the courts have not always adopted a position of self-restraint".|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure."

I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first one.
