5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Zappa met Ray Collins. Collins {{supported}} himself by {{working as a}} carpenter, and on weekends sang with {{a group called the}} Soul Giants. Collins got into a fight with their guitar player, who quit, leaving the band in need of a substitute, and Zappa filled in. The Soul Giants' repertoire originally consisted of R covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material and try to get a record contract. While most of the band members liked the idea, then-leader and saxophone player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band. The Soul Giants became <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> Zappa took over leadership of the band.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{termination}} of the British mandate, the Egyptian army, {{along with those of}} several other Arab states, immediately invaded Israel on May 15, 1948. <b>The</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> children of Be'erot Yitzhak were evacuated the next day, leaving behind about 90 workers and paramilitaries, around 30 of them women.

In the end both House and Senate published reports detailing the conditions at Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|Raisin Weekend is held {{annually}} {{over the}} last weekend of November. Affairs often begin with a tea party (or similar) thrown by <b>the</b> <b>mother(s)</b> <b>and</b> then a pub-crawl or house party led by the father(s). It is fairly common for several academic families to combine in the latter stages of the revels. At midday all the First-Years gather in Quad of St Salvator's College to compare their receipts and also {{to be open to}} challenge from older students who may look for errors in the Latin of the receipt (an almost inevitable occurrence). Upon detection of such error(s) the bearer may be required to sing the Gaudie. In recent years the gathering has culminated in a shaving foam fight.|$|E

50|$|The {{postpartum}} period begins {{after the}} delivery of the placenta. In Hindu communities, a “sutak” or “pollution confinement” period, which is a length of time for which <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> baby are considered unclean, follows <b>the</b> birth. <b>The</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> baby are {{in a place of}} confinement, usually a room in the home, during the “sutak” period. This can range in length from 3 to 10 days, and no family or community members may interact with <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> baby during this time. At the end of this period, a “kuan pujan” or “ceremony at the well” occurs, in which <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> baby are purified and considered clean. In Muslim communities, this period does not exist. The baby is sprinkled with holy water in a ritual bath.|$|R

25|$|In December 1976, 22 {{captured}} Montoneros {{responsible for}} the death of General Cáceres Monié and the attack on the Argentine Army 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment were tortured and executed during the Massacre of Margarita Belén, in the military Chaco Province, for which Videla would be found guilty of homicide during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, as well as Cristino Nicolaides, junta leader Leopoldo Galtieri and Santa Fe Provincial Police chief Wenceslao Ceniquel. The same year, fifty anonymous persons were illegally executed by a firing-squad in Córdoba. Victims' relatives uncovered evidence that some children taken from their mothers soon after birth were being raised as the adopted children of military men, as in the case of Silvia Quintela, a member of the Montoneros guerrillas movement. For three decades, <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group founded in 1977, has demanded the return of these kidnapped children, estimated to number as many as five hundred. 77 of the kidnapped children have been located so far.|$|E
25|$|Through the 18th century, {{the area}} was ruled {{variously}} by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African slaves as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of free people of color (gens de couleur libres), mostly multiracial descendants of European men and enslaved women, and their children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), {{both before and after}} marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of plaçage. With this social capital, the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. After Great Britain's victory in the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris (1763). They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec.|$|E
25|$|With {{the firm}} {{guidance}} of 'ulema', the diverse native traditions were transformed to a uniform mold that crossed borders and customs. The original diverse traditions were consistently {{shaped to conform}} to specific norms embedded in the Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to <b>the</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering mothers and daughters, incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While {{the best of the}} Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of Sufi mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law (Sharia) and concept of waging violent external jihad against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a myriad of attempts to curb it, Sufism has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.|$|E

500|$|By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also {{distributed}} by Warner Bros. Zappa continued {{a high rate}} of production through {{the first half of the}} 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No.10 on the Billboard pop album charts helped by the chart single [...] "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow". Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as [...] "Dinah-Moe Humm" [...] and [...] "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called <b>the</b> <b>Mothers,</b> <b>and</b> are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as [...] "Inca Roads", [...] "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" [...] and [...] "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)". A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures [...] "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band". Zappa released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period. They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.|$|E
2500|$|The term white stolen generations {{is used to}} {{distinguish}} this group from the Indigenous stolen generations. It is estimated that around 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were removed from their mothers from the 1930s to 1982 in what was widely seen by {{society as a whole}} at the time as a positive thing for both <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> the children.

Standards of informed consent for research subjects were not rigorously enforced at that time, and many of the women were not informed of the potential risks. The injections were later suspected to have caused cancer in at least three of the children who were born to these mothers.

2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

I put my arms around <b>the</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} purgatory, Protestant religious philosopher Jerry L. Walls wrote Purgatory: The Logic of Total Transformation (2011). The book evoked reviews and news stories. It received a positive review in the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews.Historically informed, philosophically competent, and theologically alert, [...] [...] [...] as careful and fair a discussion of the doctrine of purgatory as one is likely to find. The Christian Century suggested that, if Protestants followed Walls’ logic, they might accept his view of an intermediate state without calling it purgatory. Within early Christianity, he finds [...] "biblical hints of Purgatory" [...] and examines them. In a survey of Christian writers whom he calls the [...] "Fathers and Mothers of Purgatory," [...] Walls finds the beginnings of the doctrine of purgatory in their writings. These three sources led up to the [...] "birth of Purgatory" [...] in the 12th century. The 13th century saw the beginnings of Purgatory’s adoption and its adoption as doctrine in 1274. Walls does not base his belief in Purgatory primarily on Scripture, <b>the</b> <b>Mothers</b> <b>and</b> Fathers of the Church, or the Magisterium (doctrinal authority) of the Roman Catholic church. Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it [...] "makes sense." [...] For Walls, Purgatory has a logic as in the title of his book. Walls documents the [...] "contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models" [...] of Purgatory. In the satisfaction model, [...] "the punishment of purgatory" [...] is to satisfy God’s justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes that [...] "Purgatory might be pictured [...] [...] [...] as a regimen to regain one’s spiritual health and get back into moral shape." [...] In Roman Catholic theology, Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has [...] "swung" [...] between the [...] "poles of satisfaction and sanctification" [...] sometimes [...] "combining both elements somewhere in the middle." [...] He believes the sanctification model [...] "can be affirmed by Protestants without contradicting their theology" [...] and find that it [...] "makes better sense" [...] than an instantaneous purging of sin at the moment of death.|$|E
