40|$|A {{soot blower}} {{is used to}} blow off soot on tubes in a tubular heat exchanger, or a gas heater. The soot blower has a long {{flexible}} tube, that is, a <b>lance</b> <b>tube,</b> 8 m long and 76. 2 mm in diameter, which is put slowly into/out of a gas heater. Steam flows through the <b>lance</b> <b>tube</b> and is discharged at the free end to blow off soot. The <b>lance</b> <b>tube,</b> rotating slowly about its axis at about 12 rpm, is supported at an intermediate position by a support bearing, that is, a lance bearing. Vibrations and noises occurred in operation while a <b>lance</b> <b>tube</b> is being put into a gas heater slowly. They are considered self-excited vibrations due to friction between the <b>lance</b> <b>tube</b> and the <b>lance</b> bearing. From frequency analysis dominant frequencies of the observed vibrations are the eighth to tenth natural frequencies. Experimental study is done to clarify the mechanism of the vibration. Accordingly, backward whirling motion of a shaft is observed. As the clearance between the flexible shaft and the circular support is reduced, higher modes appear...|$|R
50|$|Sootblowers utilize flowing media such as water, air or {{steam to}} remove {{deposits}} from the tubes. This is typically done during maintenance {{with the air}} blower turned on. There are several different types of sootblowers used. Wall blowers of the rotary type are mounted on furnace walls protruding between the convection <b>tubes.</b> The <b>lances</b> are connected to a steam source with holes drilled into it at intervals along its length. When it is turned on, it rotates and blows the soot off the tubes and out through the stack.|$|R
50|$|The KD7 type Kaidais were 346 ft {{long and}} {{displaced}} 1,833 t when surfaced. The diesel-electric propulsion system provided a maximum speed of 23 kn when surfaced or 8 kn when submerged. The boats could operate for 75 days before resupply. Armament consisted of six forward-facing torpedo <b>tubes</b> firing Long <b>Lance</b> torpedoes (with 14 carried), a 4.7-inch deck gun, and a 25-millimetre anti-aircraft gun.|$|R
50|$|The {{far end of}} {{the tube}} is {{pre-heated}} and lit by an oxyacetylene torch. An intense stream of burning steel is produced at the workpiece end and can be used to cut rapidly through thick materials including steel and concrete. The tube is consumed, so every few minutes the operator shuts off the oxygen, discards the remaining stub of a <b>lance</b> <b>tube</b> and starts using a new one.|$|R
50|$|Soon, the {{submarine}} had two additional problems, enemy escorts {{bearing down on}} her and a torpedo running hot {{in one of her}} stern <b>tubes.</b> Sand <b>Lance</b> came up to 100 ft and fired the torpedo. Eight seconds later, it exploded prematurely, adding to the damage to her stern. Fortunately, the explosion apparently convinced the Japanese that they had destroyed {{the submarine}}, for Sand Lance received no further attacks. She surfaced after dark, but the damaged gear could not be repaired. Forced to make the voyage back to Fremantle on one shaft, she made port on 19 August. On 10 September, she headed east for Pearl Harbor and, from there, on to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where she arrived on 1 November.|$|R

500|$|In 1287, a {{group of}} {{soldiers}} equipped with hand cannons led by commander Li Ting (...) attacked Nayan's camp. The History of Yuan reports that the hand cannons not only [...] "caused great damage," [...] but also caused [...] "such confusion that the enemy soldiers attacked and killed each other." [...] The hand cannons were used again {{in the beginning of}} 1288. Li Ting's [...] "gun-soldiers" [...] or chongzu (...) were able to carry the hand cannons [...] "on their backs" [...] according to the History of Yuan. The passage on the 1288 battle is also the first to coin the name chong (...) for metal-barrel firearms. Chong was used instead of the earlier and more ambiguous term huo tong (...) , which may refer to the <b>tubes</b> of fire <b>lances,</b> proto-cannons, or signal flares.|$|R
5000|$|The first German man-portable {{flamethrower}} {{was called}} the Kleinflammenwerfer (small flamethrower) or [...] "Kleif". Fuel was stored in a large vertical, cylindrical backpack container. High-pressure propellant was stored in another, smaller container attached to the fuel tank. A long hose connected the fuel tank to a <b>lance</b> <b>tube</b> with an igniting device at the nozzle. The propellant forced the fuel through the hose {{and out of the}} nozzle at high speed when a valve was opened. The igniting device at the nozzle set fire to the fuel as it sprayed out. The flamethrower was operated by two soldiers, one carrying the fuel and propellant tanks, another wielding the lance (though it was 70lbs it could be operated by one soldier). Wex, a replacement for the Kleif, was introduced in 1917 after the third battle of Ypres.|$|R
40|$|A laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) system combining a Cassegrain {{telescope and}} a double-pulse laser mode was developed for the in situ analysis of steel melt. Optical- and electrical-related devices were sealed in an enclosed box away from the high-temperature steel melt surface. Connected to the box by a flange, a long hollow steel tube {{was used for the}} laser and plasma emission transmission path. At the tip of the steel <b>tube,</b> a refractory <b>lance</b> that can withstand high temperatures was immersed into the molten steel surface to pass through the surface slag layer. The designed optical structure successfully keeps the photoelectric-associated system components away from the high-temperature environment, thus reducing the complexity of system protection and maintenance. The signals obtained from single-pulse and double-pulse LIBS were comprehensively compared; the effect of argon blowing on spectral stability was analyzed; and the quantitative analysis of Si, Mn, Cr, Ni and V in molten steel samples was evaluated using both a univariate model and a partial least squares (PLS) model. The relative root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values and average relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the PLS model were approximately 5 % and 2 %- 3 %, respectively, both of which are less than those of the univariate calibration model. The sealed LIBS setup was also transferred to a steel plant for application testing, and the obtained accuracy approached the plant&# 39;s accuracy requirements. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of carbon was also achieved {{on the basis of the}} PLS models. These results demonstrate that the developed system is promising for the in situ analysis of melt steel in the steelmaking industry...|$|R
