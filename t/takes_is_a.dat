Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened {{out there in the}} woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know... So I said, 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'." [...] Raftis received notes reading, [...] "We know how to get you and your kids. All it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> match".|$|E
500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically what it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E

2500|$|As {{summarized}} {{by the official}} press of his time, he [...] "put all his efforts into directing peasants toward the cottage industry", created [...] "home economics classes and adult education courses", and [...] "was the first to speak" [...] at educational conferences. He established a dairy factory, as well as shops for weavers, ropemakers, wainwrights and woodturners, and showcased their products at the 1900 World's Fair. Following Julius Kühn, Kalinderu insisted that the precondition of a [...] "rational economy" [...] was good livestock, so he inaugurated a freely accessible breeding program, also providing tenants with cultivars, or with beekeeping and sericulture implements. He also reintroduced reforestation and forest farming where bad practices had affected the environment. Kalinderu held {{the notion that the}} Romanian peasant was miserable for being illiterate, and that [...] "all it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set of favorable circumstances for him to display [...] talents". The efforts to educate his tenants were conjugated with those of Steauas Haret, by then National Liberal Minister of Education, providing young students with work experience and physical culture, as well as inculcating in them a patriotic awareness. A significant portion of his time was spent on teaching peasants to diversify their diet, including providing hired hands with daily rations of vegetables, meat and milk. This helped to prevent outbursts of pellagra.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous but it was something the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it <b>takes</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E
