5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The later {{history of}} Kent shows clear {{evidence}} {{of a system of}} joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that Æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son, Eadbald. It may be that Æthelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with Æthelberht, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
60|$|This {{course of}} conduct {{was not in}} any degree occasioned by a {{discovery}} of the degradation in which Rebecca had lived. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of that between mother and son. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> of anything but the fearfully-exact resemblance between the living, breathing woman and the specter-woman of Isaac's dream.|$|R

The talented and dedicated Sailors of this group demonstrated tremendous operational flexibility and performed {{at the highest levels}} of excellence across the warfare spectrum and core capabilities of the Maritime Strategy. They were warriors, ambassadors, partners and humanitarians. They represent all that is good in our country and I'm profoundly honored to sail with this impressive strike group.|$|E
25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an {{opportunity}} to do so. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E

25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E

2500|$|British {{historian}} Max Hastings says <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> as {{a military}} genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was [...] "an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler".|$|E
2500|$|While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> storm {{spotting}} {{has saved}} many lives and aided weather agencies greatly, {{there is concern}} that storm spotting may actually put individuals in danger. It is a common practice for many spotters to leave their vehicles or places of shelter to better observe, but this also places spotters {{in a situation where}} they can be harmed or killed by lightning. Most spotting groups do not recommend that individuals leave their vehicles or places of safety.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Committee members felt that the graver charges would not be believed in if the more sensationalist accusations were dismissed, as Wilson claims. [...] However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the Committee members exercised poor judgement in their selection of some testimony. [...] They reprinted 55 depositions from the small town of Hofstadt, many dubious, where fewer than ten murders occurred. [...] (The depositions average only 2.11 on Lipkes’s scale, with soldiers providing 85% of the testimony.) [...] Meanwhile, the Committee failed to investigate carefully well-documented cases of mass executions, such as Andenne, Tamines, and Dinant.|$|E

[...] Further, the petitioner has not alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender. [...] Here the Nevada statute is narrower and precise." [...] The Nevada Supreme Court had held that the Nevada statute required only that the suspect divulge his name; presumably, he could do so without handing over any documents whatsoever. [...] As long as the suspect tells the officer his name, he has satisfied the dictates of the Nevada stop-and-identify law.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 September 2002, Netanyahu testified (under oath as {{a private}} citizen) before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{regarding}} the nuclear threat posed by the Iraqi régime: [...] "There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons – no question whatsoever," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> once he acquires it, history shifts immediately." [...] Netanyahu and other high rank officials from different countries had suspected that Iraq could develop a nuclear capability, as the country began building {{a nuclear power plant}} program in 1959 with the USSR, but Israeli airstrikes had destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 (see Operation Opera).|$|E
