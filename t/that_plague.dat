5|$|Records state <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> {{deaths in}} London and the suburbs crept {{up over the}} summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures {{are likely to be}} a {{considerable}} underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. Quakers refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the Great Fire of London the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} seen Swift as hopeless {{in regards to}} actual change for Ireland. The rich could never change from their {{absentee}} landlord mentality that has stripped Ireland of its economic independence, {{and that is why}} Swift spends the majority of his sermon discussing the poor. Swift proposes a remedy of sorts that would help the poor; they should be educated and the free travel of beggars should be restricted. These ideas were intended to limit the amount that the poor consumed in society, which, combined with a proposal for the poor to act more virtuously, should correct many of the problems <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> Ireland, but these ideas were never put into effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to insist that they get what they deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E

25|$|The Lumbee are {{originally}} from North Carolina, {{where they are}} concentrated in Robeson County. During the early and mid-20th century, the same wave of migration that brought large numbers of African Americans from the Deep South and poor white people from Appalachia also brought many people from the Lumbee tribe. The Baltimore American Indian Center was established in 1968 in order to {{serve the needs of}} this community. In 2011 the center established a Native American heritage museum, including exhibits on Lumbee art and culture. The urban Lumbee and other Native Americans in Baltimore are concentrated in the 6 blocks around Baltimore Street in East Baltimore. This community is the largest Lumbee community outside of the Lumbee's tribal territory. As of 1993 there were 4,300 Lumbee in Maryland, 2,500 of whom resided in Baltimore between Fleet and Fayette streets, Broadway and Milton Avenue. At the time, the South Baltimore Baptist Church at 211 S. Broadway had a congregation that was approximately 95% Lumbee. The Lumbee tend to be poor. Native Americans in Baltimore, the vast majority of whom are Lumbee, have the lowest income level of any ethnic or racial group, including white people, African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. High levels of unemployment, drug and alcohol abuse, and domestic violence are problems <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> the community. Over a third fall below the poverty line and the average Lumbee only has an eighth grade level education.|$|E

500|$|According to folklorist Jennifer Westwood, the stoor worm's {{head was}} [...] "like a great mountain"; its breath was putrid, contaminating plants and {{destroying}} any humans or animals with its blast. Traill Dennison reported the serpent's length was [...] "beyond telling, and reached {{thousands and thousands}} of miles in the sea". Giant sea swells and earthquakes were attributed to the beast yawning, a sign it wanted to be fed rather than of fatigue. Islanders were terrified of the serpent; it was described by Traill Dennison, who transcribed its story, as [...] "the worst of the nine fearful curses <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> mankind". A further tale recorded by Traill Dennison gives a brief mention of another stoor worm, described as the progeny of the Orcadian monster, which is killed when it is severed in two by an oversized mythical ship.|$|E

500|$|Sword of Aragon is a [...] "strategic fantasy {{role-playing}} adventure" [...] {{video game}} published in 1989. [...] The game's setting is the fictional land of Aragon.

[...] Furthermore, he recovers three artifacts required to claim the throne, slays a dragon, and destroys the strongholds of monsters <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> the land.

500|$|Vonnegut's works have, {{at various}} times, been labeled science fiction, satire and postmodern. He also {{resisted}} such labels, but his works do contain common tropes {{that are often}} associated with those genres. In several of his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in works of science fiction. Vonnegut does this to emphasize or exaggerate absurdities and idiosyncrasies in our own world. Furthermore, Vonnegut often humorizes the problems <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> societies, as is done in satirical works. However, literary theorist Robert Scholes noted in Fabulation and Metafiction that Vonnegut [...] "reject the traditional satirist's faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [...] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter." [...] Examples of postmodernism may {{also be found in}} Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism often entails a response to the theory that the truths of the world will be discovered through science. Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective, as it is biased towards each individual's beliefs and outlook on the world. They often use unreliable, first-person narration, and narrative fragmentation. One critic has argued that Vonnegut’s most famous novel, Slaughterhouse-Five, features a metafictional Janus-headed outlook because the novel seeks to represent actual historical events while, at the same time, problematizes the very notion of doing exactly that. While Vonnegut does use elements as fragmentation and metafictional elements, in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril posed by individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, then proceed to impose these truths on others.|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a [...] "splendid" [...] episode that [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured [...] "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" [...] and particularly enjoyed the [...] "sweet non-aggressive fighting" [...] between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties <b>that</b> <b>plague</b> the harvest festival were funny, [...] "but like the best of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series [...] "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot [...] "wildly politically incorrect, but funny". National Post writer Scott Stinson said Parks and Recreation [...] "continues to challenge for the title of best comedy on television", and called the continuing romance between April and Andy a [...] "welcome development" [...] for both characters.|$|E
