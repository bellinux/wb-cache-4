40|$|This paper empirically investigates <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> into Japanese banks, which {{were based on}} the Financial Function Stabilization Law and the Early Strengthening Law, on <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> crunch. Using {{financial}} panel data for all of the Japanese commercial banks, we estimate dynamic panel models which investigate <b>the</b> effects of <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> on banks’ lending behaviour. We find a negative impact of <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> on their lending behaviour. This finding is different from that of previous studies, which concluded that <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> had positive effects. Though <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> were expected to free banks from capital regulatory constraint, Japanese banks that had received <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> became more sensitive about their capital adequacy ratios, and reduced their loans; the exception was the domestic banks that received <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> based on <b>the</b> Early Strengthening Law.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} optimisation problems of {{an insurance company}} whose risk reserve process follows the settings of the classical risk model. The insurer has the possibility to control its surplus process by paying dividends to the shareholders. Furthermore, the shareholders are allowed to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> such that <b>the</b> surplus process stays nonnegative. A control strategy describes the decision on the times {{and the amount of}} the dividend payments and <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> To measure <b>the</b> risk associated with a control strategy, {{we consider}} the value of the expected discounted dividends minus the penalised expected discounted <b>capital</b> <b>injections.</b> Because of <b>the</b> discounting, it can only be optimal to make <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> at times when the reserve would become negative due to a claim occurrence. Our goal is to determine the value function, which is defined as the maximal value over all proper strategies, and to find an optimal strategy which leads to this maximal value. First, we solve the optimisation problem for the classical risk model when <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are penalised by some proportional factor greater than one. We show that an optimal strategy exists and is of barrier type, i. e., all the surplus exceeding some barrier level is paid as dividend. In the second part, we extend this model by adding fixed costs incurring any time at which <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> are made. <b>The</b> optimal strategy here is not of barrier type any more, but of band type. That is a strategy where the state space of the surplus process is partitioned into three types of sets where either dividends at the premium rate, or lump sum dividends, or no dividends at all are paid. In the third part, we allow the dynamics of the surplus process to depend on environmental conditions which are modelled by a Markov process. I. e., the frequency of the claim arrivals and the distribution of the claim amounts vary over time depending {{on the state of the}} environment process. We again maximise the difference between the expected discounted dividends and <b>the</b> (proportional) penalised <b>capital</b> <b>injections</b> and show that the optimal strategy for any fixed initial environment state is of barrier type with a barrier depending on the initial state. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{implicit}} subsidies received, in the form of stock market returns, from the perception that large banking organizations are too big to fail, and implications for financial regulation.

Findings – The paper finds positive and statistically significant stock return reactions both for a portfolio of the large banking organizations that are part of <b>the</b> initial <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> plan and a portfolio of the large banking organizations that are not part of <b>the</b> initial <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> plan, implying a too-big-to-fail (TBTF) effect, especially for the latter group of institutions. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses on a short time frame of stock price reactions to specific events, for the largest US banks. Further examination of longer-term stock price effects on US as well as foreign banks may be of interest. Practical implications – The results have implications for the manner and scope of financial regulatory actions and changes in regulators' approaches to systemic risk and individual bank regulation. Originality/value – The paper examines TBTF bank subsidy effects in response to a rapidly unfolding financial crisis.

In all cases, closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal dividend and reinsurance policies are obtained.

40|$|The authors examine investors' {{reactions}} to announcements of large seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) by U. S. financial institutions (FIs) from 2000 to 2009. These offerings include market infusions {{as well as}} <b>injections</b> of government <b>capital</b> under <b>the</b> Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The sample period covers both business cycle expansions and contractions, and the recent financial crisis. They present evidence on the factors affecting FI decisions to issue <b>capital,</b> <b>the</b> determinants of investor reactions, and post-SEO performance of issuers {{as well as a}} sample of matching FIs. The authors find that investors reacted negatively to the news of private market SEOs by FIs, both in the immediate term (e. g., the two days surrounding the announcement) and over the subsequent year, but positively to TARP injections. Reactions differed depending on the characteristics of the FIs, stage of the business cycle, and conditions of financial crisis. Larger institutions were less likely to have raised capital through market offerings during the period prior to TARP, and firms receiving a TARP injection tended to be larger than other issuers. The authors find that while TARP may have allowed FIs to increase their lending (as a share of assets) in the year after the issuance, they took on more credit risk to do so.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the implications of}} spread-adjusted Taylor rules and capital injection policies in response to adverse shocks to the economy, using {{a variant of the}} financial accelerator model. Our model comprises the two credit-constrained sectors that raise external finance under credit market imperfection: financial intermediaries (FIs) and entrepreneurs. With the model estimated using the U.

We formalize a capital injection policy as a positive (negative) amount of injection to either of the two sectors in response to an adverse shock (a favorable shock). In contrast to a spread-adjusted Taylor rule, a positive injection boosts the economy regardless of the type of shock. <b>The</b> <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> to the FIs has a greater impact on the economy compared with that to the entrepreneurs.

In our model, the regulator controls the dynamic risk-shifting incentives of a representative bank through the threat of intervention in the bank’s operations. The optimal regulatory policy, which we characterize analytically, entails an optimal combination of a capital requirement, intervention to control the risk of <b>the</b> bank’s portfolio, <b>capital</b> <b>injection,</b> and liquidation of the bank.
