The extraction method based on liquid–liquid extraction technique was used to extract the analytes and IS from of 50  µL of human plasma using methyl <b>tert-butyl</b> ether:ethyl <b>acetate</b> (80 : 20, v/v), which offers a high recovery. Chromatographic separation of analytes and IS was achieved on a Hypersil gold C 18 column using gradient mobile phase consisting of 2  mM ammonium formate/acetonitrile. The flow rate was set at 0. 5  mL/min to elute all the analytes and IS within 1. 00  min runtime. Detection of target compounds was performed on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via positive electrospray ionization (ESI). Method validation results demonstrated that the developed method has good precision and accuracy over the concentration ranges of 0. 1 – 2000  ng/mL for each analyte.

40|$|This bench-scale study {{investigated}} the feasibility of activated persulfate (S(2) O(8) (2 -)) oxidation of methyl tertbutyl ether (MTBE), using pyrite (FeS(2)) {{as the source of}} ferrous ion activators. Under the FeS(2) -activated S(2) O(8) (2 -) condition, the sulfate free radical (SO(4)) is the predominant reactive species generated. The oxidation reactions were able to completely degrade MTBE when given sufficient doses of FeS(2) and S(2) O(8) (2 -) and sufficient reaction time (e. g., 3 g FeS(2) /L and 5 g Na(2) S(2) O(8) /L within 4 h) and exhibited generation and subsequent degradation of the primary MTBE degradation intermediate products including tert-butyl formate, <b>tert-butyl</b> alcohol, methyl <b>acetate,</b> and acetone.

Hair samples (50 mg) were decontaminated and subjected to methanolic extraction, where 1 ml methanol was added along with the internal standard abacavir-d 4 at a final concentration of 0. 15 ng/mg hair. After 16 h, the drugs were recovered by liquid-liquid extraction using ammonium acetate buffer and a mixture of methyl <b>tert-butyl</b> ether:ethyl <b>acetate</b> (1 : 1). The samples were reconstituted with 200 μl acetonitrile:water (1 : 1) prior to injection for LC-MS/MS. The LOD and LOQ values were 0. 06 and 0. 12 ng/mg (drug/hair) for both drugs. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 0. 12 - 4. 0 ng/mg of drug/hair with regression coefficient (r(2)) value of 0. 999 for both drugs. The data for accuracy, precision and recovery were within the FDA limits. The concentrations of the drugs in the hair samples ranged from 0. 12 ng/mg to 4. 48 ng/mg and 0. 32 ng/mg to 1. 67 ng/mg for tenofovir and abacavir, respectively.

40|$|Degradation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in aqueous {{solution}} by Fenton's reagent (Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2) was investigated. Effects of reaction conditions on the oxidation efficiency of MTBE by Fenton's reagent were examined in batch experiments. Under optimum conditions, 15 mM H 2 O 2, 2 mM Fe 2 +, pH 2. 8 and room temperature, the initial 1 mM MTBE solution was reduced by 99 % within 120 min. Results showed that MTBE was decomposed in a two-stage reaction. MTBE was first decomposed swiftly based on a Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 reaction and then decomposed somewhat less rapidly based on a Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 reaction. The detection of Fe 2 + also supported {{the theory of the}} two-stage reaction for the oxidation of MTBE by Fenton's reagent. The dissolved oxygen in the solution decreased rapidly in the first stage reaction, but it showed a slow increase in the second stage with a zero-order kinetics.

The influence of different factors such as temperature, solvent polarity, mim concentration, and water content on Kmim by using 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride {[C 4 C 1 im]Cl} as a model compound was comprehensively studied. The calculated thermodynamic functions of transfer (∆trG 0, ∆trH 0, ∆trS 0) showed that the mim migration (IL→organic phase) is a thermodynamically unfavorable and enthalpy-determined process in the temperature range of 298. 15 to 328. 15 K; however, the results suggested that mim partition toward the organic phase can be enhanced by the rational manipulation of the extraction conditions. Experiments conducted with other 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolim chlorides (CnC 1 im]Cl (n = 6, 8, 10) revealed that mim possesses similar behavior and can be successfully washed out from the ILs by extraction with organic solvents.

As a potential probe for assaying fluorescent transaldolase, 6 -O-coumarinyl-fructose (1) was prepared in six steps from D-fructose. The corresponding 6 -O-coumarinyl- 5 -deoxy derivative 2 was prepared stereoselectively from acrolein and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate</b> by a chemoenzymatic route involving Amano PS lipase for the kinetic resolution of tert-butyl 3 -hydroxypent- 4 -enoate (7) and E. coli transketolase for assembly of the final product.

40|$|We {{have found}} that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA 1 {{produced}} a thermostable esterase. We isolated and sequenced the esterase gene (estPc) from strain VA 1. estPc consisted of 939 bp, corresponding to 313 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 34, 354 Da. As estPc showed significant identity (30 %) to mammalian hormone-sensitive lipases (HSLs), esterase of P. calidifontis (Est) could be regarded as a new member of the HSL family. Activity levels of the enzyme were comparable or higher than those of previously reported enzymes not only at high temperature (6, 410 U/mg at 90 °C), but also at ambient temperature (1, 050 U/mg at 30 °C). The enzyme displayed extremely high thermostability and was also stable after incubation with various water-miscible organic solvents at a concentration of 80 %. The enzyme also exhibited activity in the presence of organic solvents. Est of P. calidifontis showed higher hydrolytic activity towards esters with short to medium chains, with p-nitrophenyl caproate (C 6) the best substrate among the p-nitrophenyl esters examined. As for the alcoholic moiety, the enzyme displayed esterase activity towards esters with both straight- and branched-chain alcohols. Most surprisingly, we found that this Est enzyme hydrolyzed the tertiary alcohol ester <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> a feature very rare among previously reported lipolytic enzymes. The extreme stability against heat and organic solvents, along with its activity towards a tertiary alcohol ester, indicates a high potential for the Est of P. calidifontis in future applications...|$|E

For ethyl vinyl ether, clean and selective formation of the iron ethoxide was observed with concomitant loss of the vinyl fragment. In situ monitoring of the catalytic hydrogenation of trans-methyl cinnamate established ester C-O bond cleavage as a competing process. Stoichiometric reactions between 1 -(N(2)) (2) and allyl and vinyl acetate also produced facile C-O oxidative addition. For the latter, a six coordinate diamagnetic bis(imino) pyridine acetatoxy iron vinyl compound was obtained and characterized by X-ray diffraction. Phenyl acetate undergoes exclusive acyl C-O bond cleavage, while alkyl-substituted esters such as ethyl, pentyl, benzyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate</b> undergo competing ester and acyl C-O bond cleavage accompanied by iron-promoted decarbonylation. Deuterium labeling studies established that reversible C-H activation and chelate cyclometalation Occur prior to, but are not a prerequisite for, carbon-oxygen bond oxidative addition of ethyl acetate.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{confinement}} on the kinetics {{of the surface}} hydrolysis of polystyrene-block-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PSn-b-PtBAm) thin films on oxidized silicon substrates in 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid was systematically investigated. As shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements, a skin layer of acid-sensitive PtBA is present {{on the surface of}} PSn-b-PtBAm films, consistent with the lower surface tension of PtBA compared to that of PS. The thickness of the skin layer was determined by angle-dependent XPS as ~ 8 nm for PS 690 -b-PtBA 1210. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy showed an increasing surface coverage of swollen poly(acrylic acid) -rich globules with increasing hydrolysis time. Using ex situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the reaction kinetics was determined quantitatively as a function of temperature, polymer film thickness, thermal pretreatment of the films, and block copolymer composition. The initial stages of the hydrolysis can be described as a pseudo-first-order reaction under all conditions investigated. The corresponding rate constants were found to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the hydrolysis of <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in solution and depended linearly on the fraction of PtBA exposed at the surface. However, the polymer film thickness, thermal pretreatment of the films, block copolymer composition, and local composition did not affect the rate constants. The negative value of the activation entropy (S 298 = - 103 J/mol K), determined according to the Arrhenius equation and transition state theory, indicates that the tightness of the transition state is more pronounced in the PSn-b-PtBAm film compared to reactions in solution. Thus, the spatial constraints due to the incorporation of the reactive ester groups in thin polymer films are responsible for the observed reduced reactivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{structure}} and dynamics of molecular systems were determined {{by a combination of}} quantum chemical calculations and microwave spectroscopic investigations. The microwave studies have been carried out using molecular jets and the spectral lines were assigned to the corresponding rotational transitions using the computer codes XIAM, ERHAM, and BELGI-Cs. Within this thesis six molecules, two esters and four ketones, have been studied. The <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate</b> molecule can exist as a cis and a trans conformer, where the trans conformer as the energetically favored structure has been identified in the experiment. The barrier to internal rotation was found to be 112 cm- 1 and is slightly higher than in most fruit esters. In the case of ethyl pivalate three trans conformers were predicted with quantum chemical calculations at the MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory and observed in the experiment. Because the moment of inertia of the tert-butyl group (approx. 110 uÅ 2) in ethyl pivalate is considerably bigger than that one of the acetyl methyl group (approx. 3. 2 uÅ 2) in the fruit esters internal rotation could not be observed. Therefore, the ethyl pivalate molecule can be described as an almost rigid top. Using a two-dimensional potential energy surface the existence of five conformers of diisopropyl ketone could be confirmed and the strong coupling between the isopropyl groups could be studied in detail. In the case of pinacolone a very strong coupling between the rotational motions of the acetyl methyl group and the tert-butyl group has been found on a two dimensional potential energy surface. However, only one conformer with an approximate Cs symmetry was confirmed by the experiment. Methyl neopentyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone have a similar structure. Using quantum chemical calculations at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) and the MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory all possible comformers for both molecules were predicted. With the analysis of the spectral lines the corresponding stable conformer and the internal rotation were determined. The hindering barrier of methyl neopentyl ketone was found to be approximately 174 cm- 1, while the barrier to internal rotation of the acetyl methyl group in methyl isobutyl ketone was determined to be 250. 5 cm- 1. Therefore, an important result of this thesis is, that if the substituent in a ketone is only slightly changed, this will have a tremendous influence on the barrier to methyl internal rotation in the molecule...|$|E
40|$|Precision {{cleaning}} {{is necessary}} to ensure the proper functioning of aerospace hardware, particularly those systems that {{come in contact with}} liquid oxygen or hypergolic fuels. Components that have not been cleaned to the appropriate levels may experience problems ranging from impaired performance to catastrophic failure. Traditionally, this has been achieved using various halogenated solvents. However, as information on the toxicological and/or environmental impacts of each came to light, they were subsequently regulated out of use. The solvent currently used in Kennedy Space Center (KSC) precision cleaning operations is Vertrel MCA. Environmental sampling at KSC indicates that continued use of this or similar solvents may lead to high remediation costs that must be borne by the Program for years to come. In response to this problem, the Green Solvents Project seeks to develop state-of-the-art, green technologies designed to meet KSCs precision cleaning needs. Initially, 23 solvents were identified as potential replacements for the current Vertrel MCA-based process. Highly halogenated solvents were deliberately omitted since historical precedents indicate that as the long-term consequences of these solvents become known, they will eventually be regulated out of practical use, often with significant financial burdens for the user. Three solvent-less cleaning processes (plasma, supercritical carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide snow) were also chosen since they produce essentially no waste stream. Next, experimental and analytical procedures were developed to compare the relative effectiveness of these solvents and technologies to the current KSC standard of Vertrel MCA. Individually numbered Swagelok fittings were used to represent the hardware in the cleaning process. First, the fittings were cleaned using Vertrel MCA in order to determine their true cleaned mass. Next, the fittings were dipped into stock solutions of five commonly encountered contaminants and were weighed again showing typical contaminant deposition levels of approximately 0. 00300 g per part. They were then cleaned by the solvent or process being tested and then weighed a third time which allowed for the calculation of the cleaning efficiency of the test solvent or process. Based on preliminary experiments, five solvents (ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> were down selected for further testing. When coupled with ultrasonic agitation, these solvents removed hydrocarbon contaminants as well as Vertrel MCA and showed improved removal of perfluorinated greases. Supercritical carbon dioxide did an excellent job dissolving each of the five contaminants but did a poor job of removing Teflon particles found in the perfluorinated greases. Plasma cleaning efficiency was found to be dependent on which supply gas was used, exposure time, and gas pressure. Under optimized conditions it was found that breathing air, energized to the plasma phase, was able to remove nearly 100 % of the contamination. These findings indicate that alternative cleaning methods are indeed able to achieve precision levels of cleanliness. Currently, our team is working with a commercial cleaning company to get independent verification of our results. We are also evaluating the technical and financial aspects of scaling these processes to a size capable of supporting the future cleaning needs of KSC...|$|E
