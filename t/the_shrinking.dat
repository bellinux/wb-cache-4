5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. <b>The</b> <b>shrinking</b> on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the ice sheets receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> ice sheets to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E

Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die or else they will lose the patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are divided}} over whether climate change, hunting, or a {{combination}} of the two, drove the extinction of the Columbian mammoths. According to the climate change hypothesis, warmer weather led to <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> of suitable habitat for Columbian mammoths, which turned from parkland to forest, grassland and semi-desert, with less diverse vegetation. The overkill hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the extinction to hunting by humans. This idea was first proposed by Paul S. Martin in 1967; more recent research on this subject have varied in their conclusions. A 2002 study concluded that the archaeological record did not support the overkill hypothesis, given that only 14 Clovis sites (12 with mammoth remains and two with mastodon remains) out of 76 examined provided strong evidence of hunting. In contrast, a 2007 study found that the Clovis record indicated the highest frequency of prehistoric exploitation of proboscideans for subsistence in the world, and supported the overkill hypothesis. Whatever the actual cause of extinction, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates.|$|E

5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
5|$|The second chapter, Metamorphosis, {{focuses on}} the {{evolutionary}} origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left <b>the</b> <b>shrinking</b> forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche {{gave rise to the}} human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle-walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which is more efficient over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago. The adaptations of H.ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow sweating to cool the body and larger brain. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin. The close descendants of H.ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H.heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{assessment}} of the expansive potential of clay soils {{has been the subject of}} active research for the past 40 years, its treatment in routine geotechnical practice around the world remains inconsistent. This paper describes <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> swell test, which is used routinely in Australian geotechnical practice as the principal method for the experimental assessment of the expansive potential of clay soils. The test procedure and its underlying assumptions are described and discussed in the context of the historical development of the test and its routine application. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> swell test is a simple and economical means of assessing soil expansiveness, which is achieved largely through the adoption of several simplifying assumptions that effectively circumvent the measurement of soil suction. The significance of these assumptions is discussed, and it is concluded that <b>the</b> <b>shrink</b> swell test can be conveniently and reliably employed to guide the routine design of foundations in expansive soils...|$|R
