2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of academic misconduct is the contextual factor of an environment of peer disapproval of cheating, that is, peer pressure. Psychologists note that all people tend to follow the norms of <b>their</b> <b>peer</b> group, which would include norms about academic dishonesty. [...] Thus, students who believe that their peers disapprove of cheating are less likely to cheat. Indeed, multiple studies show that the most decisive factor in a student's decision to cheat is his perception of his peers' relationship with academic dishonesty. [...] For instance, on average 69% of students cheat at colleges with low community disapproval of academic misconduct, whereas only about 23% of students cheat at colleges with strong community disapproval of academic misconduct. [...] Peer pressure works both ways, as a study found that there is a 41% increase in the probability of a student cheating if he or she has seen someone else cheat. [...] However, even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating, {{there has to be a}} community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure. For instance, larger schools, which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools, tend to have a weaker community, being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other. [...] Another measure of a college community, how many students live on campus, further shows a significant relation with a school's cheating rate. [...] Relatedly, many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior.|$|E

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent {{sense of self}} stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity.

He described the resolution of this process as a stage of [...] "identity achievement" [...] but also stressed that the identity challenge [...] "is never fully resolved {{once and for all}} at one point in time". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. [...] "Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers." [...] Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers [...] "finding their selves"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers. Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. [...] "Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards."

60|$|On {{the morning}} of the same day that Mr Egerton and his friend Mr Berners walked down {{together}} to the House of Commons, as appears in our last chapter, Egremont had made a visit to his mother, who had married since the commencement of this history the Marquis of Deloraine, a great noble who had always been her admirer. The family had been established by a lawyer, and recently in our history. The present Lord Deloraine, though he was gartered and had been a viceroy, was only the grandson of an attorney, but one who, conscious of his powers, had been called to the bar and died an ex-chancellor. A certain talent was hereditary in the family. The attorney's son had been a successful courtier, and had planted himself in the cabinet for a quarter of a century. It was a maxim in this family to make great alliances; so the blood progressively refined, and the connections were always distinguished by power and fashion. It was a great hit, in the second generation of an earldom, to convert the coronet into that of a marquis; but the son of the old chancellor lived in stirring times, and cruised for his object with the same devoted patience with which Lord Anson watched for the galleon. It came at last, as everything does if men are firm and calm. The present marquis, through his ancestry and his first wife, was allied with the highest houses of the realm and looked <b>their</b> <b>peer.</b> He might have been selected as the personification of aristocracy: so noble was his appearance, so distinguished his manner; his bow gained every eye, his smile every heart.
