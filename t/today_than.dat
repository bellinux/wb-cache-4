5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular <b>today</b> <b>than</b> {{he was when}} his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} <b>today</b> <b>than</b> when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E

5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known <b>today</b> <b>than</b> many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E
5|$|The covert war in Laos {{continues}} to fascinate those with {{any knowledge of}} it. It {{was one of the}} quintessential Cold War insurgency/counterinsurgency, low-intensity conflicts and offers many lessons in the conduct of irregular covert operations supported by modern military technology. It also remains one of only a few military operations of the Vietnam War about which both major belligerent parties (the U.S. and North Vietnam) are still reluctant to discuss openly their participation. For the North Vietnamese, this is understandable. Hanoi has no more incentive to discuss its operations <b>today</b> <b>than</b> it had in the 1960s or 1970s. Although the U.S. has been more open about its participation, the covert war remains a touchy subject.|$|E

25|$|The Ashkenazic melodies {{from central}} and western European Jewry are used far less <b>today</b> <b>than</b> before the Holocaust, but still survive in some communities, {{especially}} in Great Britain. They {{are of interest}} because a very similar melody was notated by Johann Reuchlin as in use in Germany in his day (15th–16th century, C.E.).|$|E

25|$|It is my deep {{conviction}} {{that we have}} reached {{a turning point in}} our country’s efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens. Recent events in the United States and abroad have made us realize that it is more important <b>today</b> <b>than</b> ever before to insure that all Americans enjoy these rights. When I say all Americans—I mean all Americans.|$|E
25|$|Structuralism is {{less popular}} <b>today</b> <b>than</b> other approaches, such as post-structuralism and deconstruction. Structuralism {{has often been}} criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring {{deterministic}} structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved {{to the center of}} people's attention.|$|E

25|$|The San Joaquin {{antelope}} squirrel {{is found}} in the San Joaquin Valley, including slopes and ridge tops along {{the western edge of the}} valley. It is endemic to the region, and {{is found in}} a much smaller range <b>today</b> <b>than</b> it originally inhabited. Since the San Joaquin Valley fell under heavy agricultural cultivation, habitat loss combined with rodenticide use has reduced the squirrels numbers enough that it is now listed as a threatened species.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, the madaris {{also play}} a social and {{cultural}} role in giving after-school religious instruction to children of Muslims who attend government or private non-religious schools. However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common <b>today</b> <b>than</b> it used to be.|$|E
25|$|Annual revival {{meetings}} {{have long}} been a traditional part of Nazarene life, and are still encouraged in the Manual, though may be seen less <b>today</b> <b>than</b> they once were. An evangelist comes to preach the revival services. The Church of the Nazarene licenses and credentials evangelists, many of whom earn their entire living through their ministry of evangelism. Most Nazarene districts also sponsor an annual camp meeting for adults and their families as well as separate camps for both teens and children.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{majority}} of Lope de Barrientos' writings are of a theological bent and addressed to issues of his era, they are more the province of scholarly study <b>today,</b> <b>than</b> of general interest. The major portion of his work is addressed to the ideological modernization of the Hispanic Church. He penned a number of treatises on the Sacraments (all in Latin), a compendium of moral theology and a Book of laws with which he hoped {{to contribute to the}} enrichment of canonical law.|$|E
25|$|Less {{well known}} <b>today</b> <b>than</b> Keats were others who loyally {{attended}} his lectures and constituted {{a small circle}} of admirers, such as the diarist and chronicler Henry Crabb Robinson and the novelist Mary Russell Mitford. But the rumours that had been spread demonising Hazlitt, along with the vilifications of the Tory press, not only hurt his pride but seriously obstructed his ability to earn a living. Income from his lectures had also proved insufficient to keep him afloat.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Brympton is larger <b>today</b> <b>than</b> {{at any time}} in its history. Until the 20th century, it barely {{qualified}} as a village, having been deserted in the 14th century. Thereafter the village consisted of a few cottages scattered along the long drive to the secluded mansion, a few of which can be discerned in the view by Knyff (illustrated right). Today a new urban area known as Brympton is a suburb of Yeovil, and has encroached on the seclusion of the house.|$|E
