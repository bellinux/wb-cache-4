The aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. <b>tobramycin)</b> used can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney failure with long-term use. To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or <b>tobramycin,</b> plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E

2500|$|Antibiotic {{coatings}} provide {{another way}} of preventing the growth of bacteria. Gentamicin is an antibiotic which has a relatively broad antibacterial spectrum. Also, gentamincin {{is one of the}} rare kinds of thermo stable antibiotics and so {{it is one of the}} most widely used antibiotics for coating titanium implants. [...] Other antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra are cephalothin, carbenicillin, amoxicillin, cefamandol, <b>tobramycin,</b> and vancomycin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial choice}} of {{antibiotic}} depends upon personal choice, experience and availability, but could include chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and <b>tobramycin.</b> [...] Topical gentamicin formulations are also available, {{but in the}} opinion of some, should be reserved for cases with stromal melting. [...] Frequency of application can vary from q1h to q8h, depending on both the severity of the lesion, and the formulation used (ointment vs. drops).|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{scientists}} have been examining the possible genetic basis for P. aeruginosa resistance to antibiotics such as <b>tobramycin.</b> One locus identified as being an important genetic determinant of the resistance in this species is ndvB, which encodes periplasmic glucans that may interact with antibiotics and cause them to become sequestered into the periplasm. These results suggest [...] a genetic basis exists behind bacterial antibiotic resistance, rather than the biofilm simply acting as a diffusion barrier to the antibiotic.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} CF are {{on one or}} more {{antibiotics}} at all times, even when healthy, to prophylactically suppress infection. Antibiotics are absolutely necessary whenever pneumonia is suspected or a noticeable decline in lung function is seen, and are usually chosen {{based on the results}} of a sputum analysis and the person's past response. This prolonged therapy often necessitates hospitalization and insertion of a more permanent IV such as a peripherally inserted central catheter [...] or Port-a-Cath. Inhaled therapy with antibiotics such as <b>tobramycin,</b> colistin, and aztreonam is often given for months at a time to improve lung function by impeding the growth of colonized bacteria. Inhaled antibiotic therapy helps lung function by fighting infection, but also has significant drawbacks such as development of antibiotic resistance, tinnitus, and changes in the voice. Inhaled levofloxacin may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis who are infected.|$|E

5000|$|Like all aminoglycosides, <b>tobramycin</b> {{does not}} pass the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract, so for systemic use {{it can only}} be given intravenously or intramuscularly. Ophthalmic (<b>tobramycin</b> only, Tobrex, or combined with dexamethasone, sold as TobraDex) and nebulised formulations both have low systemic absorption. The formulation for injection is branded Nebcin. The nebulised formulation (brand name Tobi) is indicated in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. A proprietary formulation of micronized, nebulized <b>tobramycin</b> has been tested as a treatment for bacterial sinusitis. [...] Tobrex is a 0.3% <b>tobramycin</b> sterile ophthalmic solution is produced by Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals. Benzalkonium chloride 0.01% is added as a preservative. It is available by prescription only in the United States and Canada. In certain countries, such as Italy, it is available over the counter. Tobrex and TobraDex are indicated in the treatment of superficial infections of the eye, such as bacterial conjunctivitis. <b>Tobramycin</b> (injection) is also indicated for various severe or life-threatening gram-negative infections: meningitis in neonates, brucellosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Yersinia pestis infection (plague). <b>Tobramycin</b> is preferred over gentamicin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia due to better lung penetration..|$|E
50|$|Comparative ototoxicity of netilmicin, gentamicin, and <b>tobramycin</b> in cats: Under the {{conditions}} of this study, at least a twofold (vestibular) to fourfold (cochlear) relative safety margin for ototoxicity was established in favor of netilmicin over <b>tobramycin</b> and gentamicin. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1985 Mar 15;77(3):479-89.|$|E
50|$|Like other aminoglycosides, <b>tobramycin</b> is ototoxic: it {{can cause}} hearing loss, or a loss of equilibrioception, or both in genetically {{susceptible}} individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as <b>tobramycin</b> to affect cochlear cells. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} amino glycosides, <b>tobramycin</b> is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys 3. This {{effect can be}} {{particularly}} worrisome when multiple doses accumulate {{over the course of}} a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing tubular reabsorption during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons [...] <b>tobramycin</b> needs to be carefully dosed by body weight, and its serum concentration monitored. <b>Tobramycin</b> is thus said to be a drug with a narrow therapeutic index.|$|E

50|$|Streptomyces spectabilis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces. Streptomyces spectabilis produces hangtaimycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin B, sisomycin, <b>tobramycin,</b> paromomycin, spectinabilin, aminocyclitol, actinospectacin, prodigiosine and the streptovaricin complex.|$|E
50|$|Resistance to {{amikacin}} and kanamycin in Mycobacterium, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is due to}} a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and <b>tobramycin,</b> and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, <b>tobramycin,</b> and apramycin. Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it.|$|E
50|$|As of 2005, {{there is}} ongoing {{research}} into inhaled antibiotics {{as an adjunct}} to conventional therapy. <b>Tobramycin</b> and polymyxin B are commonly used in certain centres but there is no clinical evidence to support their use.|$|E
50|$|Most Pseudomonas spp. are {{naturally}} resistant to penicillin {{and the majority}} of related beta-lactam antibiotics, but a number are sensitive to piperacillin, imipenem, ticarcillin, or ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides such as <b>tobramycin,</b> gentamicin, and amikacin are other choices for therapy.|$|E
50|$|Fosfomycin is {{indicated}} {{in the treatment of}} urinary tract infections (UTIs), where it is usually administered as a single oral megadose. Its use in combination with <b>tobramycin</b> to treat lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis was also explored.|$|E

50|$|It is {{strongly}} contraindicated with herpetic and other viral eye infections. Other contraindications include fungal and mycobacterial infections because <b>tobramycin</b> is inactive against those, and the corticoid {{acts as an}} immunosuppressive agent, preventing the body's immune system from dealing with the infection. The drops are also contraindicated in patients with corneal lesions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tobramycin</b> {{works by}} binding {{to a site}} on the {{bacterial}} 30S and 50S ribosome, preventing formation of the 70S complex. As a result, mRNA cannot be translated into protein, and cell death ensues. According to Kotra, Haddad and collaborators [...] "aminoglycosides, including <b>Tobramycin,</b> are multifunctional hydrophilic sugars that possess several amino and hydroxy functionalities. The amine moieties are mostly protonated in biological media; hence, these antibiotics can be considered polycationic species {{for the purpose of}} understanding their biological interactions. Since they are polycationic, they show a binding affinity for nucleic acids. Specifically, aminoglycosides possess high affinities for certain portions of RNAs, especially the prokaryotic rRNA. In addition, aminoglycosides bind to the hammerhead ribozyme, tRNA(Phe), the Rev response element (RRE) transcriptional activation region in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the ribozyme from hepatitis delta virus, and group I self-splicing introns.4" ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, {{people with}} cystic {{fibrosis}} rarely lived beyond their early teens.
