Henry soothed his wife's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to Hatfield House, where Princess Elizabeth would be living with her own sizeable staff of servants, and where the country air was <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> for the baby's health. Anne frequently visited her daughter at Hatfield and other residences.|$|E

Criticised locally for his long absence, he {{suggested}} that Lady Dorothy stand for Stockton in 1945, {{as she had been}} nursing the seat for five years. She was apparently willing. However, it was <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> for him to be seen to defend his seat, and Lord Beaverbrook had already spoken to Churchill to arrange that Macmillan be given another seat in the event of defeat.|$|E

On his way to Basra he passed through the Strait of Hormuz, where he learned that Abu Sa'id, last ruler of the Ilkhanate Dynasty had died in Persia. Abu Sa'id's territories had subsequently collapsed due to a fierce civil war between the Persians and Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson {{did not go}} to Staunton: {{his term}} as {{governor}} had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in Bedford County, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. A number of legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> of it. Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.|$|E

Next, on 2 January 1833, Clio participated in the {{re-establishment}} of British rule on the Falkland Islands. Onslow arrived at Luis Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the Argentine authorities replace {{the flag of the}} United Provinces of the River Plate with the British one and leave the islands.

25|$|The Great Northern began {{construction}} {{first on}} the Peterborough to Gainsborough section of the loop line, as the ease of construction over the flat fens promised an earlier return on investment. Because a proposed branch from Bawtry to Sheffield had been rejected by parliament, it was <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> for the loop line to rejoin the towns line at Rossington instead, so no work was done on the loop north of Gainsborough. The GNR suffered a setback in 1848 when this deviation was rejected, but arrangements were soon made to use the MS's authorized line from Sykes Junction (on the loop line north of Lincoln) to Retford and then via their own main line, and contracts for both of these lines were quickly let.|$|E

25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E

On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E

500|$|The method {{eliminated}} the psychoanalytic doctrine of neutrality. Reich {{argued that the}} psychoanalytic taboos reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient, and that he wanted his patients {{to see him as}} human. He would press his thumb or {{the palm of his hand}} hard (and painfully) on their jaws, necks, chests, backs, or thighs, aiming to dissolve their muscular, and thereby characterological, rigidity. He wrote that the purpose of the massage was to retrieve the repressed memory of the childhood situation that had caused the repression. If the session worked, he would see waves of pleasure move through their bodies, which he called the [...] "orgasm reflex." [...] According to Sharaf, the twin goals of Reichian therapy were the attainment of this orgasm reflex during sessions and orgastic potency during intercourse. Reich briefly considered calling it [...] "orgasmotherapy," [...] but <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> of it.|$|E

[...] "My Best Love", a song for Master Wang, was at first <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> suited to his sister-in-law, but when Juanita Hall could not make it work, the song was cut entirely. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed a song entitled [...] "She Is Beautiful" [...] into [...] "You Are Beautiful". [...] The team decided to include a song for Sammy Fong to explain to Mei Li that they should not wed. [...] In the span of a few hours, they wrote the lyrics and music to [...] "Don't Marry Me". [...] Once the songs were finalized, Robert Russell Bennett, who had orchestrated several of the creators' most successful previous shows, did the same for the score of Flower Drum Song.|$|E

[...] He stated in the interview that the trend in the pornographic industry is toward unprotected, unsafe sex. He has warned about the social impact on gay and bisexual men's decision making, especially when in the heat of lust and passion, while influenced by alcohol or drugs. He appeared in a short interview for his film Big Easy in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The popular {{story of}} Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's {{education}} after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death is false. According to the biography, Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution by Kevin Brown, Alexander Fleming, {{in a letter}} to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia, described this as [...] "A wondrous fable." [...] Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during World War II. Churchill was saved by Lord Moran, using sulphonamides, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug Sulphapyridine, known at the time under the research code M 693, discovered and produced by May & Baker Ltd, Dagenham, Essex – a subsidiary of the French group Rhône-Poulenc. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as [...] "This admirable M". It is highly probable that the correct information about the sulphonamide did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, Prontosil, had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer, and as Britain was at war with Germany at the time, it was <b>thought</b> <b>better</b> to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.|$|E
