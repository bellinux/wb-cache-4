5|$|At {{the height}} of its medieval glory, Dhaka was {{regarded}} as one of the wealthiest and most prosperous cities in the world. It served as the capital of the Bengal province of the Mughal Empire twice (1608–39 and 1660–1704). The city's name was Jahangir Nagar (City of Jahangir) in the 17th century. It was central to the economy of Mughal Bengal, which generated 50% of Mughal GDP. It was a cosmopolitan commercial center and <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the worldwide muslin and silk trade.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistan Navy and almost its entire fleet was based in Karachi Harbour. Since Karachi was also <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan's maritime trade, a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The security of Karachi Harbour was predominant to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes. The port's airspace was secured by the strike aircraft based at airfields in the area.|$|E

5|$|Mukunda and Janaki met up {{with friends}} from college, who would later {{come to be known}} as Shyamasundar Das, Gurudas, Malati Dasi, and Yamuna Dasi.

30|$|Represented this way, {{multiplex}} networks encode {{significantly more}} information than their single layers taken separately, since they include correlations between {{the role of the}} nodes in the different layers. For example, a node that is a <b>hub</b> in <b>the</b> metro layer {{is more likely to be}} a <b>hub</b> in <b>the</b> bus layer. Therefore, the degree of nodes in the metro layer is positively correlated with that of the bus layer. Negative correlations may also exist, when <b>the</b> <b>hubs</b> <b>of</b> one layer are not <b>the</b> <b>hubs</b> <b>of</b> another layer.|$|R

5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations {{with many of the}} First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown in the photo.|$|E

5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for {{residents}} and visitors. Assembly rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a Tontine and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, David Sasson {{immigrated to}} Bombay and {{established}} himself as a magistrate of the cotton industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition to the older Magen Hasidim synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{to remain}} the {{principal}} industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s. During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as Coppice Side was <b>the</b> <b>hub</b> <b>of</b> the mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% {{of the population of}} the area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there, with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time. As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an explosion at the Grove Colliery killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.|$|E
