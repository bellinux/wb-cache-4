Skins are retained to improve the flavor, texture, and color. Once the fruit is soft, sugar may be added, if desired. Prune and apricot butter generally require no added sugar. The fruit butter then is cooked slowly, adding water {{so that it does}} not burn, until both thickened and macerated to the desired extent.

Optimization of process parameters showed that pH 2 and contact time of 120 min was favorable for maximum adsorption. Langmuir and Khan isotherm models were applied to comprehend the adsorption process. Kinetic data showed that pseudo-first order model was a better fit than the pseudo-second order model. Alkaline pH favored desorption. Among the various desorption medium tested, acetone and ethanol showed promising results thus enabling the reuse of the carbon for next adsorption cycle.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Widespread grasses {{that occur}} {{naturally}} {{in all kinds}} of veld types. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Mostly grasses (monocotyledons) that have severely barbed awns or seeds. Usually these awns help to distribute <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of <b>the</b> plant by clinging to people or to animals that are passing by and who will then get rid of it somewhere else. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • <b>The</b> <b>seeds,</b> and especially awns, of many grasses are severely barbed (often only seen microscopically). • Following penetration of any tissue, a forward, self-propelled action of the awn occurs and it migrates around in the mouth and subcutaneous tissue. • When they get lodged, and penetrate the mucous membrane of the mouth they cause trauma and secondary bacterial infection. SYNDROMES: Mechanical irritation. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal system. CLINICAL SIGNS: Small stock: Problems are caused by Themeda triandra and Heteropogon contortus in the mouths of small stock if they are forced to eat it in milled veld hay or during feed shortages. Pets: • Setaria verticillata is a fine, soft annual weed often associated with disturbed soil and shade. • It has typical bottle-brush Setaria seeds with numerous microscopic barbs on the fine awns. • It sticks to and severely mats the coats of dogs and cats - especially those with long, soft hair. • On grooming itself <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>seed,</b> <b>the</b> awns lodge in the mouths of the animals and penetrate the soft mucous membrane which can lead to pharyngitis. TREATMENT: The awns can be mechanically removed – even by forceps if it is lodged in the mouths of the animals. Colour photos. Final web-ready size: JPEG.

Methods: Small tan coloured seeds of the watermelon were manually separated from the pulp, washed and shade dried until the seed coats were easy <b>to</b> <b>remove.</b> <b>The</b> <b>seeds</b> {{were divided into two}} portions; one was dehulled manually and milled into flour and the other was milled without dehulling.

Also, we compared the amount of seed mucilage segregation of plants living under erosive and non-erosive conditions and the proportion of species with mucilaginous diaspores of Mediterranean semiarid plant communities under those contrasted conditions. The amount of segregated mucilage positively related to longer resisting rain drop impacts in F. ericifolia but not in H. violaceum seeds. However, H. violaceum seeds with intact mucilage layer moved half of the distance because of runoff than those without. Moving from non-erosive to high-erosive sites, near 10 % increase in mucilage segregation was found in seeds of F. ericifolia but a decrease of 1 % in H. violaceum. Likewise, the presence of species with mucilaginous diaspores increases 9 - 28 % in plant communities living in those contrasted conditions. Mucilage segregation by diaspores is an effective way to reduce seed removal by erosion in plants, even if it operates in different ways depending on the species. Intensification of the exposition of plants to erosive conditions produces a quantitative response in the expression of this mechanism in one of two species tested and at community level.
