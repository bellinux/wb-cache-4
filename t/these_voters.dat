5|$|The Curia of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this curia. In the first stage, the suffrage was determined {{in the same manner}} as with the Curia of the Cities: those in the two-thirds highest tax bracket, with a high level of education, or an important office, were eligible. <b>These</b> <b>voters</b> elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E

25|$|Pollsters were {{puzzled by}} the failure of {{mainstream}} forecasting models to predict the 2016 election outcome. Sean Trende, writing for RealClearPolitics, wrote that many of the polls were accurate, but that the pundits' interpretation of these polls neglected polling error. Nate Silver found that the high amount of undecided and third-party voters in the election were neglected in many of these models, and that many of <b>these</b> <b>voters</b> decided to vote for Trump.|$|E
25|$|Research also {{indicated}} that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population. Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and {{were also more likely}} than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt. There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the Daily Mail, Daily Express, and The Sun, all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether <b>these</b> <b>voters</b> gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.|$|E

HDP co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş was widely seen as the victor of the election, {{in the sense that}} as well as exceeding many vote share projections, his party won the same amount of MPs (80 seats) as the Nationalist Movement Party. The international press characterised Demirtaş as the 'Kurdish Obama' and supporters of the HDP took to the street to celebrate their success on the evening of polling day. HDP MP Sırrı Süreyya Önder also stated that the HDP was aware that many voters voted tactically to ensure that the HDP passed the 10% threshold, claiming that the party would not alienate <b>these</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

25|$|The runoff count took a week, {{handled by}} the Democratic State Central Committee (because this was a party primary). Johnson was finally {{announced}} the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295 cast. The Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination {{by a majority of}} one (29–28), with the last vote cast on Johnson's behalf by Temple, Texas, publisher Frank W. Mayborn. There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor John B. Connally, was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting, just at the close of polling. Some of <b>these</b> <b>voters</b> insisted that they had not voted that day. Robert Caro argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that 10,000 ballots were also rigged in Bexar County alone. Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 mayoral {{election}} in Burlington, Vermont {{provides an example}} in which strategy theoretically could have worked but would have been unlikely in practice. In that election, most supporters of the candidate who came in second (a Republican who led in first choices) preferred the Condorcet winner, a Democrat, to the IRV winner, the Progressive Party nominee. If 371 (12.6%) out of the 2951 backers of the Republican candidate (those who also preferred the Democrat over the Progressive candidate for mayor) had insincerely raised the Democrat from their second choice to their first (not changing their rankings relative to their least favorite candidate, the IRV winner), the Democrat would then advance to the final round (instead of their favorite), defeated any opponent, and have won the IRV election. This {{is an example of}} potential voter regret in that <b>these</b> <b>voters</b> who sincerely ranked their favorite candidate as first, find out after the fact that they caused the election of their least favorite candidate, which can lead to the voting tactic of compromising. Yet because the Republican led in first choices and only narrowly lost the final instant runoff, his backers would have been highly unlikely to pursue such a strategy.|$|E

[...] Also, many of the newly registered voters were the result of voter registration drives to register voters for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for the March 4, 2008 Ohio Democratic primary. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a 9-6 decision, ruled against Brunner on October 14, 2008 in deciding that extra steps must be taken to authenticate these registrants and Jeffrey Sutton's majority opinion suggested that these misregistered voters cast provisional ballots. [...] Historically, 20% of provisional ballots have been thrown out.

He won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internship in concentration camps during the war. African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively. Sitkoff reported that the WPA [...] "provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source" [...] of income.

50|$|Because {{elections}} are locally administered in the United States, voter suppression varies among jurisdictions. At {{the founding of}} the country, most states limited the right to vote to property-owning white males. Over time, the right to vote was formally granted to racial minorities, women, and youth.

Most of <b>these</b> <b>voter</b> suppression tactics were made illegal after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
