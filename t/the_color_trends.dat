40|$|We {{address the}} problem of the factors {{contributing}} to a peak <b>color</b> <b>trend</b> of old metal-rich globular cluster (MRGC) populations with mass of their hosts, early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak <b>color</b> <b>trend</b> can achieve up to ~ 50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>trend,</b> ~ 30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0. 1 to 0. 2 dex because of a correlation between the [alpha/Fe] ratios and age.

We detect 200 and 94 GCs with certainty in the near-ultraviolet (NUV; 1750 - 2750 Angstroms) and far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1350 - 1750 Angstroms) bandpasses, respectively. Our rate of detection is about 50 % in the NUV and 23 % in the FUV, to an approximate limiting V magnitude of 19. Out of six clusters with [Fe/H]>- 1 {{seen in the}} NUV, none is detected in the FUV bandpass. Furthermore, we find no candidate metal-rich clusters with significant FUV flux, because of the contribution of blue horizontal-branch (HB) stars, such as NGC 6388 and NGC 6441, which are metal-rich Galactic GCs with hot HB stars.

Although in-situ measurements of rips {{can be made in}} the field, it is generally safer and more cost effective to employ remote sensing methods, such as coastal video imaging systems. However, there is no universal, fully-automated method capable of detecting rips in imagery. In this paper we discuss the benefits of image manipulation, such as filtering, prior to rip detection attempts. Furthermore, we present a new approach to detect rip channels that utilizes synthetic imagery. The creation of a synthetic image involves the partitioning of the ‘parent’ image into key areas, such as sand bars, channels, shoreline and offshore. Then, pixels in each partition are replaced with <b>the</b> respective dominant <b>color</b> <b>trends</b> observed in <b>the</b> parent image.

30|$|Historic {{evidence}} of shifting patterns in dominant <b>color</b> <b>trends</b> demonstrates that <b>the</b> many possible variations in hue, value, and saturation make color a very mutable component of fashion change. Although {{the concept of}} fashion change was long considered only in relation to costume, we know now that fashion-driven change {{has the ability to}} touch all of consumers’ aesthetic choices (Sproles 1981). Fashion is visually observed as styling characteristics that are popular in a particular time frame, or as a set of trends that have been accepted by an audience when competing choices exist (Brannon 2010). History suggests that fashion change is inevitable. The tricky part for designers, product developers, and merchandisers is forecasting what consumers will choose. In <b>the</b> past, <b>color</b> forecasters have suggested that <b>color</b> <b>trends</b> begin in fashion apparel and eventually spread to other product categories, including home appliances, home interior design products, home exterior products, and automobiles, after 2 – 3  years (Verlodt 1994). This implies that <b>color</b> <b>trends</b> for different products may cycle at different rates but follow a similar pattern. Becker (2016) noted that patterns may shift due to volatile business environments.

40|$|The age {{matching}} {{model has}} recently been shown to predict correctly the luminosity L and g-r color of galaxies residing within dark matter halos. The central tenet of the model is intuitive: older halos tend to host galaxies with older stellar populations. In this paper, we demonstrate that age matching also correctly predicts <b>the</b> g-r <b>color</b> <b>trends</b> exhibited {{in a wide variety}} of statistics of the galaxy distribution for stellar mass M* threshold samples. In particular, we present new measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal as a function of M* and g-r <b>color</b> from <b>the</b> Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and show that age matching exhibits remarkable agreement with these and other statistics of low-redshift galaxies. In so doing, we also demonstrate good agreement between the galaxy-galaxy lensing observed by SDSS and the signal predicted by abundance matching, a new success of this model. We describe how age matching is a specific example of a larger class of Conditional Abundance Matching models (CAM), a theoretical framework we introduce here for the first time. CAM provides a general formalism to study correlations at fixed mass between any galaxy property and any halo property. The striking success of our simple implementation of CAM provides compelling evidence that this technique has the potential to describe the same set of data as alternative models, but with a dramatic reduction in the required number of parameters. CAM achieves this reduction by exploiting the capability of contemporary N-body simulations to determine dark matter halo properties other than mass alone, which distinguishes our model from conventional approaches to the galaxy-halo connection.
