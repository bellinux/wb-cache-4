To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> energetic working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games.

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim was <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work {{was provided by the}} rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record.

Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from {{the bones of the}} child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> focused welding arc {{and as a result}} is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Golem Arcana {{was funded}} through a Kickstarter {{campaign}} that launched in September 2013 {{and went on}} to raise over $500,000. The game was released just under a year later, on 13 August 2014. Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and executive producer Ray Winninger had extensive experience developing both video games and tabletop games, and one of their primary motivations in creating Golem Arcana was to merge the two gaming types. They also sought <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> social experience than could be found in traditional multiplayer video games.|$|E

5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool {{painting}} {{was commissioned by}} Arthur George, Third Earl of Onslow, after Delaroche and George reportedly visited the Louvre in Paris, where they saw David's version of the famous event. It had only recently been re-hung in the museum after a resurgence of interest in Napoleon, nearly 40 years after he was exiled. Agreeing that the {{painting was}} unrealistic, George, who owned a sizable collection of Napoleonic paraphernalia, commissioned Delaroche <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> realistic depiction. Elizabeth Foucart-Walker asserts that in fact the painting that hangs in the Louvre was produced first as it was already in America by 1850, when the Liverpool painting was produced. Stephen Bann suggests that Arthur George's meeting with Delaroche may have occurred, but Delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to America. The Liverpool version of the painting is more refined.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par. In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> technologically advanced game. As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in {{the series}} has become notable for its high difficulty, along with several mechanics that have endured through the years. A key element present since the first Megami Tensei {{is the ability to}} recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle, alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> powerful demon. Equivalents to these systems appear in the later Persona titles. The game's most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system, first introduced in Nocturne. The Press Turn System is a turn-based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies, where either party are rewarded an extra turn for striking an enemy's weakness. A Moon Phase System or equivalent, in which phases of the moon or changes in the weather affected the behavior of enemies, is also featured in multiple games.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{video game}} adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places {{a strong emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature {{over the course of the}} game with the help of gadgets like a motion tracker and a flamethrower. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design. Creative Assembly originally intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but the perspective was later changed to first-person in order <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> intense experience.|$|E
