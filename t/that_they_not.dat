5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} supervisory board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> move to Christiania.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Stu {{discuss their}} plan to kill Sidney and frame the murder spree on her father, {{whom they have}} taken hostage. The pair also reveal <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>not</b> Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive. Billy attacks Sidney but she shoots him through the head, killing him. As the sun rises and police arrive, a badly injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Governor Lawrence had easily {{captured}} Fort Beauséjour, and {{had then}} embarked {{on what has}} since {{become known as the}} Great Expulsion, the forcible removal of more than 12,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia. When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> disembark. For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables were bare, save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{lightning}} campaign {{exposed the}} Austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. Mack completely misread the French dispositions and scattered his forces; as the French defeated each unit separately, the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications. Napoleon arrived to take personal command {{of close to}} 80,000men. At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000infantry and 3,273cavalry. The officers were released on the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.|$|E

5000|$|MacNeill stated of the {{original}} Volunteers, [...] "the example of the former Volunteers (of 1782) is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did <b>not</b> fight but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did <b>not</b> maintain their organisation till their objects had been secured".|$|R

5|$|The {{other type}} is the square plan with simple {{projections}} and recesses {{but with a}} possibility of both sekhari and bhumija superstructures. The plan {{does not have any}} additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these nagara temples in the Kalyani region is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> only differ from the dravida temples in the north Karnataka region but from the nagara temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the nagara articulation of these temples are the same as found {{to the north of the}} Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} explain why women left the company {{at a faster rate}} than men and develop {{recommendations}} to reverse that trend, Cook established the ‘Task Force on the Retention and Advancement of Women.’ Next, the Task Force hired a consulting company, and after many interviews and extensive analysis, the conclusion was just this: Deloitte was a lousy place for a woman to work. Most women explained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did <b>not</b> feel valued, <b>that</b> the minute <b>they</b> start a family they are written off, that nobody was willing to invest in them, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did <b>not</b> have mentors, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do <b>not</b> see women in leadership positions, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do <b>not</b> see role models. On the other hand, the male interviewees explained that it would be awkward to mentor and instruct women due to their sensitive character and also <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could <b>not</b> trust them with important assignments, assuming <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would break down. Most of them assumed that women would not want to travel or stay late at the office due to their commitments to their families.|$|R
2500|$|However, MONUC took a {{negative}} stance on Ntaganda's involvement.

This negative sentiment was finally scaled down to the point where MONUC stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would <b>not</b> [...] "sit down and take a photo with Bosco Ntaganda." ...|$|R

25|$|Anti-Catholicism was {{widespread}} in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible with democracy and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing <b>that</b> <b>they,</b> <b>not</b> the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.|$|E

25|$|However, {{extermination}} on {{the sole}} basis of political affiliations {{is not included}} in the contemporary definition of genocide under international law.
