[...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Gilligan crafted the episode with the intention to feature a tense cat and mouse game between Mulder and Modell. He later explained, [...] "the only conscious <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do from the start was get them together as much as I could". When Gilligan turned in his script, he told series creator Chris Carter that the episode was [...] "the best work I'm ever gonna [...] do for you." [...] Carter retorted that the writers for the show should always [...] "better yourself" [...] by trying to out-do their last scripting effort. The character of Modell would later return in the fifth season episode [...] "Kitsunegari".|$|E

He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Record, Carr stated he wanted to entertain the reader, while also staying faithful to the time period. Carr, a historian by training, {{wanted to find a}} form of writing where he could meld his interest in fiction with his knowledge of history. [...] "The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show was that people back then are a lot more like people today than we realize," [...] said Carr. Carr researched the science and literature of the time period and noted, [...] "The biggest challenge was to study the psychological literature of that day so that none of my characters would not know more than they could have known in terms of psychology. We're talking about a time when [...] had just published his first book." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Miller {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson: [...] "There's a real hope. The last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do is another Mad Max, but this script came along, and I'm completely carried away with it." [...] The film's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles. Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative. However, he {{stated that he}} thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age. Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008. On 5 March 2009, it was announced that an R-rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road, although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a [...] "different route", a [...] "renaissance" [...] of the franchise. Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for {{what he wanted to do}} with the franchise. Miller was also developing an action-adventure tie-in video game based on the fourth film, along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years, according to Miller, with a release date of either 2011 or 2012. Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios, a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell.|$|E
