25|$|Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) {{consists}} of methods for distributing a secret amongst {{a group of}} participants, each of whom is allocated {{a share of the}} secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares, of possibly different types, are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own. A secret sharing scheme is perfect if every collection of participants that does not meet the criteria for obtaining the secret, has no additional knowledge of what <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> than does an individual with no share.|$|E

Brock is certain that <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> connected to the walls, but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering. [...] Under mounting pressure to succeed, Brock uses every available instrumentation, only to be told, by Jill, that the presence she had felt earlier was now gone, apparently meaning that the [...] "tape" [...] has been erased. Brock's failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him, requiring him to share Taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine.|$|E

Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim to find out what <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E

500|$|Tom Hall {{announced}} that Ananchronox would feature a [...] "turbulent {{story with a}} roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. <b>The</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E

Visual Cryptography deals with any secrets such as printed or pictures, etc. These <b>secrets</b> <b>are</b> fed into <b>the</b> system in a digital (image) form. The digital form of <b>the</b> <b>secrets</b> <b>is</b> then divided into different parts based on the pixel of <b>the</b> digital <b>secret.</b> These parts <b>are</b> called shares. The shares are then overlapped correctly to visualize <b>the</b> <b>secret.</b> This paper shows the different applicable areas of Visual Cryptography...|$|R

2500|$|Two nonparallel {{lines in}} the same plane {{intersect}} at exactly one point. Three nonparallel planes in space intersect at exactly one point. More generally, any n nonparallel (n − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes intersect at a specific point. The secret may be encoded as any single coordinate of the point of intersection. [...] If <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> encoded using all the coordinates, {{even if they are}} random, then an insider (someone in possession of {{one or more of the}} (n − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes) gains information about the secret since he knows it must lie on his plane. [...] If an insider can gain any more knowledge about the secret than an outsider can, then the system no longer has information theoretic security. [...] If only one of the n coordinates is used, then the insider knows no more than an outsider (i.e., that the secret must lie on the x-axis for a 2-dimensional system). [...] Each player is given enough information to define a hyperplane; <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> <b>is</b> recovered by calculating the planes' point of intersection and then taking a specified coordinate of that intersection.|$|E
