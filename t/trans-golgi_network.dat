5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>network.</b> Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Those {{proteins}} {{destined for}} {{areas of the}} cell other than either the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus are moved through the Golgi cisternae towards the trans face, to a complex network of membranes and associated vesicles known as the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>network</b> (TGN). This area of the Golgi is {{the point at which}} proteins are sorted and shipped to their intended destinations by their placement into one of at least three different types of vesicles, depending upon the signal sequence they carry.|$|E
25|$|The profuse binding of ricin {{to surface}} {{membranes}} allows internalization with {{all types of}} membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the functional properties of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against ricin. Ricin molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>network,</b> and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>network</b> to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{shell of}} the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E protein and M protein. The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>Network</b> (TGN) it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers. These homodimers lie flat against the viral surface giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. During this maturation pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein {{shell of the}} mature virion. The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.|$|E
2500|$|Insulin {{consists}} of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called preproinsulin in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). [...] The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming proinsulin. In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed. [...] About 5â€“10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the <b>trans-Golgi</b> <b>network</b> (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.|$|E
