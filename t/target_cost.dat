40|$|The <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> {{process at}} most firms {{can be broken}} into three major steps. The first {{consists}} of market-driven costing, the second of product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing,</b> and the third of component-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> To identify {{the factors that influence}} the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process at firms, an exploratory comparative analysis of the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> processes at six Japanese manufacturing firms is undertaken. From this analysis, five factors are identified that play a role in influencing the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process by altering the levels of the benefits that the firms can derive from <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> The factors that help shape market-driven costing include the intensity of competition {{and the nature of the}} customer. The factors that help define the benefits associated with product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> include the firm’s product strategy and the characteristics of the product. Finally, the firm’s supplier-base strategy influences the benefits associated with component-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> It is argued that it is these five factors that primarily determine the magnitude of the benefits that the firm will generate from the application of <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> As the benefits increase, the amount of energy the firm is willing to expend on the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process is expected to increase concomitantly. Therefore, firms that gain significant benefits from <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> are likely to have more extensive <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> processes than those that gain only minor benefits.

50|$|Following the {{completion}} of market-driven costing, the next task of the <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> process is product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing.</b> Product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost. To achieve this goal, product-level <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is typically divided into three steps as shown below.|$|R
40|$|<b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> is a cost {{management}} {{system designed to}} develop products {{with a level of}} profitability deemed adequate to justify their production. This paper examines whether production-related decisions made with <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> consistently add economic value to the firm. A traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model is compared to one that incorporates the cost of capital. An analysis of the two models reveals that the traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model systematically underestimates the marginal cost of invested funds and overestimates the marginal cost of cash-related production resources. A numerical example and graphical analysis demonstrate that a traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model can lead to accepting products that have a negative net present value, while rejecting products that have a positive net present value. Mathematical analysis of a traditional <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> model indicates that it is a systemic property of the model. <b>Target</b> <b>costing</b> Product cost Production-related decisions...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} is to set a product-level <b>target</b> <b>cost.</b> Since the {{allowable}} cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> process, including monitoring the relationship between the <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total target costs at the component-level does not exceed the <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as value engineering (VE), design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA), and quality function deployment (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.|$|E
50|$|Target costing is an {{approach}} to determine a product’s life-cycle cost which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired profit. It involves setting a <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> by subtracting a desired profit margin from a competitive market price. A <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> is {{the maximum amount of}} cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the <b>target</b> <b>cost</b> from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spread the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting product life cycle. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the <b>target</b> <b>cost.</b> However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of cost reduction determined by target costing process.|$|E

It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992), Sakurai (1989), Tanaka (1993), and Cooper (1992) described the way that Japanese companies applied <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> to thrive in their business (IMA 1994).

40|$|In the 1960 ’s, the Japanese car {{manufacturer}} Toyota developed <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> – a management accounting model {{that reduces the}} risk of releasing unprofitable products. The method eventually spread to Swedish firms. The study starts by summing recent previous research on <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> in Sweden (full description of these studies is available in Appendix I). Looking at this research, it is noted that there is an inconsistency with regards to what principles of <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> are used, and which are not. It is also noted that some firms are claimed to be used <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> and some firms are claimed not to be using it. No study, however, has tried to find an explanation to why some principles are implemented and why some are not. This is also the theoretical contribution of this thesis. More specifically, the research problems are therefore: (1) is <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> really implemented in a different way in Sweden as compared to Japan and (2), if so, why are there differences? It is further assumed that ideology could be a good explaining variable for the possible differences in implementation. In answering the first question, <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is firstly described according to well-known books and articles on the subject. Following normative description, a presentation is made how <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> has been employed in Sweden. Secondary data based on three quantative studies is used here. These two descriptions are then contrasted against each other and it is found that <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> is implemented in a different way as compared to normative Japanese literature. Next, the second question is answered by constructing a theoretical framework based on ideological- and managerial assumptions of Japan and Sweden, respectively. This framework is then used to try to explain the differences mentioned above. Through the analysis it is observed that the Swedes’ lower priority of financial goal as well as their orientation towards the future are often used to explain the differences. These two aspects are also two of the main differences between Swedish and Japanese ideologies. It is therefore concluded that the differences might be explained using ideological assumptions, although there are probably other important factors as well. An implication of the result is that it is questionable whether <b>target</b> <b>costing</b> even will reach popularity in Sweden.
