5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as <b>temporary</b> <b>warehouses,</b> auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers {{doing business in the}} market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15thcentury. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. The reputation of the Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full scale theatrical performances.|$|R

5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of a sustained physiological {{image of an}} object after its physical offset has been observed by many individuals throughout history. One of the earliest documented accounts of the phenomenon was by Aristotle who proposed that afterimages {{were involved in the}} experience of a dream. [...] Natural observation of the light trail produced by glowing ember {{at the end of a}} quickly moving stick sparked the interest of researchers in the 1700s and 1800s. They became the first to begin empirical studies on this phenomenon which later became known as visible persistence. In the 1900s, the role of visible persistence in memory gained considerable attention due to its hypothesized role as a pre-categorical representation of visual information in visual short-term memory (VSTM). In 1960, George Sperling began his classic partial-report experiments to confirm the existence of visual sensory memory and some of its characteristics including capacity and duration. It was not until 1967 that Ulric Neisser termed this quickly decaying memory store iconic memory. Approximately 20 years after Sperling's original experiments, two separate components of visual sensory memory began to emerge: visual persistence and informational persistence. Sperling's experiments mainly tested the information pertaining to a stimulus, whereas others such as Coltheart performed directs tests of visual persistence. [...] In 1978, Di Lollo proposed a two-state model of visual sensory memory. Although it has been debated throughout history, current understanding of iconic memory makes a clear distinction between visual and informational persistence which are tested differently and have fundamentally different properties. Informational persistence which is the basis behind iconic memory is thought to be the key contributor to visual short term memory as the precategorical sensory store.A similar storage area serves as a <b>temporary</b> <b>warehouse</b> for sounds.|$|R

40|$|The {{scheme for}} economy of {{electric}} energy during {{the work for}} an example of a grain thrower of the ZME 60 type (Voronezh Region, Semiluki) on grain flows in rural economy is offered. Grain thrower can carry out the following technological operations: loading of grain in vehicles; loading and unloading of grain stores; mechanical shoveling of grain on the open areas; separation of grain with office of light impurity. In the scheme the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t (SIEMENS firm) is used. The relay can carry out multipurpose protection of engines and comprises the relay of the maximum current, the relay of the minimum current, a timer and the index relay. Temporary charts of the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t are provided in the mode "without preservation" and in the mode with "preservation" for the OVER functions (reaction to growth of current) and the UNDER function (reaction to recession of current). Use of the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t allowed to receive protection at long start-up of electric motors, at an overload of electric motors, when idling (for economy of electric energy due to automatic shutdown of the conveyor) and at break or jamming of the conveyor. Besides, in the scheme it is offered the multipurpose relay of tension (the relay of control of phases) for protection of three engines of a grain thrower at not full-phase modes of a power line. The economy of electric energy can be received in case of, for example, the late actions of the operator for timely shutdown of the engine of a self-feed upon transition of a grain thrower to idling. In practice transition of a grain thrower to the mode of idling is quite often possible in process of reduction of amount of the thrown grain on a platform before a grain thrower. In practice transition of a grain thrower to the mode of idling is quite often possible in process of reduction of amount of the thrown grain on a platform before a grain thrower.

50|$|Dieppe {{was known}} as Upper Village after the Expulsion and was settled by the Surette, Maillet, and Thibodeau families, while Chartersville was called Leblanc's Village and also {{included}} members of the Boudreau's clan. Prior to 1800, Pierre Bourgeois had established himself on the (Ruisseau des Renards) Fox Creek salt marsh. Agriculture, forestry and some fishing sustained these Acadian families up until the mid-1800s, when shipbuilding and railways created employment opportunities for Acadians around the Moncton area. After a bridge was completed in 1867 {{at the mouth of}} Hall's Creek (Nacadie during the French settlement at Le Coude), a road was constructed that link the incorporated Town of Moncton's Westmorland Road (Main Street) to the (French Village) Dieppe area. This road went through farmland that had belong to the Leger family and intersected the old road (Acadie Avenue) that had taken travellers up and around Hall's Creek to the community of Lewisville to get to Moncton. By 1900, the little area around the intersection became known as Léger's Corner, and with the increasing traffic from the bridge, merchants became attracted to the corner and soon set up shops and services around the intersection. Prior to the First World War, a small residential development was erected, and the community continue to grow until the Second World War. Then a population explosion occurred. Léger's Corner received the largest influx of military personnel in southeastern New Brunswick. Ten thousand airmen (due to the airport) and their support staff arrived overnight in 1940, and soon <b>temporary</b> <b>warehouses</b> and housing were erected. When Léger's Corner became incorporated as a municipal village in 1946, the community was renamed Dieppe, after a port in France on the English Channel, to honour the 913 Canadian servicemen {{who took part in the}} Dieppe Raid, the bloody landing by Allied soldiers, on August 19, 1942, during the Second World War. Then, part of Lakeburn was annexed in 1946 and Dieppe-East in 1948. A referendum (262 for, 232 against) marginally favoured the village to incorporate as the Town of Dieppe in 1952. At that time, Dieppe had over 3,000 inhabitants within its boundaries. Growth continued unabated throughout the 1950s and 1960s as Dieppe annexed the villages of Saint-Anselme and Chartersville and the local service districts of Fox Creek-Dover(Upper Dover), the latter in 1973. With its rural expansion came a growth in population exceeding 8,500 in the 1981 census. Within the 1980s and early 1990s, the Town of Dieppe, like the rest of the region, went through an economic downfall which limited its growth in population. By 2001, the Greater Moncton area and Dieppe's economy flourished and with it came a population increment of nearly 15,000 in 2001 to over 23,000 in 2011. To preserve its heritage, culture and identity as a community in Southern New Brunswick, Dieppe opted to incorporate itself as a city on January 1, 2003. At that time it became New Brunswick's eighth incorporated city.|$|R

40|$|When {{suppliers}} offer temporary discounts, retailers {{must decide}} the proper size of ordering. EOQ {{is used to}} determine ordering size. However in production process, not all products is in good condition. The presence of defective products is a natural thing, {{this is due to}} production quality is not perfect. Moreover, the fact that the capacity of the warehouse has a certain limit. Therefore, it is necessary EOQ model that takes into account three factors: product defects, temporary discounts, and limited warehouse capacity. EOQ model in this study refers to the formulation of inventory in the two warehouses by considering imperfect products and formulations inventory with temporary discounts and limited warehouse capacity. The level of demand for the product are deterministic and defective goods with a certain level is known. Two types of ordering size used in this model is the normal ordering and special ordering. Temporary discount is given if the retailer ordered with special sizes or at the first time ordered a normal size for a certain period. Furthermore, the process of checking the delivered products from suppliers to retailers. Defective products are sold at a cheaper price than good products. This model provides an optimal solution by the total inventory cost savings. Numerical example is presented to illustrate application of the model. The sensitivity analysis showed that the increase {{in the value of the}} capacity of the <b>warehouse</b> and <b>temporary</b> discount fraction causes increased value of decision variables, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit. While the increase in the fraction of the holding cost causes a decrease in the value of the decision variable, inventory costs, total sales, and total profit.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} case study of the labor process and employment conditions within warehouses and distribution centers in Southern California—a crucial stop in the global supply chain for a myriad of transnationally sourced goods. It employs qualitative research methods including in-depth interviews with warehouse workers, managers, and contractors, in addition to using participant observation to examine workers’ understanding of the workplace, resistance, and class relations embedded in global commodity chains. Combining theoretical insights from research on the labor process and global capitalism, it argues that the appropriate foci for the analysis of globalization and class are the shop floors integrated into these chains. While research on the transnational capitalist class has been robust, transnational working class formations have been relatively understudied. Thus, to analyze these issues the dissertation focuses on the following questions: How do transnational corporations maintain control over labor within warehouses and distribution centers despite large geographic distances and complex institutional environments mediating relationships between capitalists and workers? What are the mechanisms of exploitation used in warehouses and distribution centers, and how do workers experience and respond to those mechanisms when executing labor, comprehending the labor process, and resisting exploitation and control? How does the coordination of the labor process on global capital’s part contribute to the formation of a global “working class in-itself?” How are warehouse workers in Southern California organizing to improve their working conditions, and build alliances with other workers in the global supply chain? These questions are addressed by analyzing relationships between the complex networks of transnational firms—global retailers, logistics and <b>warehousing</b> companies, and <b>temporary</b> employment services—and <b>warehouse</b> workers, labor organizations, and their allies. Findings suggest that coordination and control is achieved through information and transport technologies, task standardization, and complex workplace regimes relying on the use of immigration, gender, and racial and ethnic statuses. Such arrangements induce precarity for workers, and dangerous working conditions that create substantial stresses and strains. Finally, the relationships that obtain from participation in these workplaces embedded in transnational commodity chains have impacts on transnational class formation and resistance in the global era...|$|R
