60|$|I. JUSTICE AND JUSTIFICATION.--(1) It is the {{business}} of this life to make excuses for others, but none for ourselves. We should be clearly persuaded of our own misconduct, for that {{is the part of}} knowledge in which we are most apt to be defective. (2) Even justice is no right of a man's own, but a thing, like the king's tribute, which shall never be his, but which he should strive to see rendered to another. None was ever just to me; none ever will be. You may reasonably aspire to be chief minister or sovereign pontiff: but not to be justly regarded in your own character and acts. You know too much to be satisfied. For justice is but an earthly currency, paid to appearances; you may see another superficially righted; but be sure he has got too little or too much; and in your own case rest content with what is paid you. It is more just than you suppose; that your virtues are misunderstood is a price you pay to keep your meannesses concealed. (3) When you seek to justify yourself to others, you may be sure you will plead falsely. If you fail, you have the shame of the failure; if you succeed, you will have made too much of it, and be unjustly esteemed upon the other side. (4) You have perhaps only one friend in the world, in whose esteem it is worth while for you to right yourself. Justification to indifferent persons is, at best, an impertinent intrusion. Let them think what they please; they will be <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to forgive <b>you</b> in the end. (5) It is a question hard to be resolved, whether you should at any time criminate another to defend yourself. I have done it many times, and always had a troubled conscience for my pains.|$|R

But I do believe there is a certain segment of this book, and my project, which provides some genuine insight into the nature of architectural expression. It deals with the design of a stage set for a production at Muncie Civic Theatre. Approximately 2. 400 people viewed the project over the run of the show. Very few of those people will ever see this book, or realize some of the deeper issues which my project has addressed, in fact many of the issues that I address within this report deal with situations and experiences revealed well after the date the set was actually "finished" from the audiences standpoint. Such it is with architecture [...] . the true essence of your design comes to life after the time that we as a profession deem the project "past the point of substantial completion.

40|$|Abstract- This paper reviews {{literature}} of the Gamblerâs and the hot hand fallacies and the possible differences inherent in explaining investor behaviour. The Gamblerâs fallacy is built {{on the belief that}} the more you lose, the higher your next probability of winning in the near future; whereas the hot hand is built on the belief that the more the chances you get right now, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> will get right even in the future. This beliefs are erroneous since they go contrary to the equal chances attributed to the probability of flipping a fair coin according to laws of probability. The investors tend to believe that the performance of a mutual fund is a combination of the managerâs ability and luck will, at first, underestimate the likelihood that a manager of average ability will exhibit a streak of above- or below-average performance. Both Gamblers â and hot hand fallacies are illusions and ideal to a level of factual outcome which remains paradoxical. To a given level of accuracy, the paper based on the existing researches tends to give more weight unto the realness cast in the hot hand fallacy as opposed to the gamblerâs fallacy. However, there is no conclusiveness as to the wellbeing or vagueness of either given that both are heuristics, investors making judgments on how things appear rather than how statistically likely they are...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} specifically {{investigates the}} factors that influenced access by households and individuals to credit in the financial sector in Ghana, using the Ghana Living Standards Survey for years 1988 / 89, 1991 / 92 and 1998 / 99. The research sheds light on the extent at which the financial liberalisation policy has affected households and individuals in accessing credit with the view of improving their standard of living. In this research, two sources of credit are identified. Formal credit including debts from commercial banks and other financial institutions; and informal credit including debts from relatives and friends, traders, and moneylenders. Probit, Heckman probit with sample selection, multinomial logit, seemingly unrelated regression estimates and treatment effects models {{were used for the}} analytical work. The results suggest that the different characteristics of households and individuals affect access to credit and these have changed over the time with the implementation of the financial liberalisation policy. An additional result shows that the consumption pattern of households changes with access to credit. At both the national and rural community level, the analysis of the data revealed that you are more likely to access credit the older you are, the larger your household size and if you owned a house. You are more likely to access credit (whether formal or informal) if you were a professional or in an administrative job and married. However, the farther away you live from a bank, the less likely you are to access credit but surprisingly <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> are to access credit if you live farther away from a market. On the effects of access to credit on the consumption pattern of households, the results showed that households with access to credit improve on their consumption pattern by consuming more non-food items. The results suggest that there is need to address key factors that inhibit access to credit by micro-economic units that would facilitate economic growth and development.

40|$|The payout rate on lotto is {{normally}} fixed. We show {{that such a}} policy is generally suboptimal from the lotto authorities â point of view. The payout rate {{should be allowed to}} vary according to the number of rollovers that have occurred. To illustrate our argument, we simulate and optimize an econometric model of the lotto market in Israel. We also consider whether it is profitable to increase the frequency of lotto from once to twice a week. We wish to thank the referees for helpful remarks and the Eshkol Institute for Social Research in Israel for financial support in completing this research. âThat the chance of gain is naturally overvalued, we may learn from the universal success of 2 lotteries. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will see, a perfectly fair lottery; or one in which the whole gain compensated the whole loss; because the undertaker could make nothing by it. In the state lotteries the tickets are not really worth the price which is paid by the original subscribers, and yet commonly sell in the market for twenty, thirty, and sometimes forty percent advance. The vain hope of gaining some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand. The soberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the chance of getting ten or twenty thousand pounds; though they know that even that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty percent more than the chance is worth. In a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds, though in other respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one than the common state lotteries, there would not be the same demand for tickets. In order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes, some people purchase several tickets, and others, small shares in a still greater number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition in mathematicks, than that the more tickets you adventure upon, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> are to be a loser. Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty. ...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Economics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Economic {{theories}} usually {{assume that}} the amount of work offered by individuals increase as wages and salaries increase. However, there are volunteers who present their work without payment for the production of goods and services, for the benefit of others. Volunteer work is of significance in a time when social safety nets are weak and there are ever increasing demands on welfare organisations. Volunteers {{can make a difference in}} their communities and entire society in general which means that if they are understood better, it may be possible to harness their power for the greater good. Therefore, this thesis analyses volunteers and volunteerism in South Africa and the factors that determine their efforts. The manuscript presents a critical discussion of economic theories of volunteering, major concepts and types of volunteers to arrive at a plausible set of models explaining volunteerism and the general motives of volunteers. The descriptive analysis of data sets from the Labour Force Survey was conducted. The data also allows for the estimation of a limited dependent variable regression model of the probability of volunteering as a function of individual-specific predictors. The results from Logit (Binary LogitRegression) regression showed that all estimated coefficients have the expected signs: Females are more likely to do volunteer work more than males; older people are more likely to participate more in volunteer activities than middle age and younger ones. The results also reveal that the higher your level of education, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>you</b> will be to do volunteer work. This was the same with income: higher income individuals are more likely to do volunteer work. This study also used data from the Volunteer Activities Survey (VAS) to describe volunteers and estimate a model of the determinants of hours of volunteer work supplied. The results indicate a robust relationships between volunteered and determinant such as gender, age group; population group, level of education, income category, marital status and employment status, to mention few. Results from the regression model show that age is positively related to hours spend doing volunteer work. Even though the gender variable is found to be not statistically significant, the results indicated that women do volunteer work more than men. The further a person is educated the more he/she will participate in voluntary work. The evidence indicated that there is a positive relationship between income and hours of volunteering. The evidence provides a number of findings that are important to policymakers, non-profit organisations and all other stakeholders in volunteerism. This study could be used to devise more efficient and effective plans of how the number of volunteers and the hours that they volunteer could be retained and increased. Doctora...|$|E
