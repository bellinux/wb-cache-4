Comment: The main result of the paper (Theorem 1) is a very simple consequence of the following trivial observation: <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> all zigzag is equal to the number of flags.

5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%–30% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E
