5|$|A green tinge in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{associated with}} nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, {{when combined with}} gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E
5|$|Apples {{are often}} eaten raw. The whole fruit {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> suitable {{for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia cutis. Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E

25|$|When rosé wine is {{the primary}} product, it <b>is</b> {{produced}} with <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> contact method. Black-skinned grapes <b>are</b> crushed and <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} juice for a short period, typically one to three days. The must is then pressed, and <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> discarded rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer that <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>are</b> left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.|$|R

5|$|Nantes carrots. These have sparse foliage, are cylindrical, short {{with a more}} blunt tip than Imperator types, and attain high yields in a {{range of}} conditions. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> easily damaged and the core is deeply pigmented. They are brittle, high in sugar and store less well than other types. Cultivars include 'Nelson Hybrid', 'Scarlet Nantes' and 'Sweetness Hybrid'.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head one-third {{the length of}} its body; the blowhole is slightly to the left hand side; <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
30|$|Drug {{deposition}} {{study was}} performed on the excised rat abdominal skin using a Franz diffusion cell (Padamwar and Pokharkar 2006). Epidermal side of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> exposed to ambient condition, while dermal side was kept facing the receptor solution. Receptor compartment containing 30  mL phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was thermostated at 37 [*]±[*] 0.5  °C and stirred at 600  rpm. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> saturated with diffusion medium for 1  h before the application of sample. A 100  mg of gel sample (equivalent to 30  mg curcumin) was applied on the donor compartment. The samples were withdrawn at different time intervals. For determination of drug deposited in <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> diffusion cell <b>was</b> dismantled {{at the end of the}} run (24  h). <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> carefully removed and drug present on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> surface <b>was</b> cleaned with distilled water and analyzed for drug content.|$|R

5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E

5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
5|$|The large pelvic fins {{originate}} {{beneath the}} disc and have convex trailing margins. Adult males have very short and thick claspers. The broad and flattened tail is {{shorter than the}} disc and bears a fold of skin along either side. There are two small dorsal fins, both with rounded to angular apices; the first is slightly smaller than the second, and its position varies from over to behind the pelvic fins. The caudal fin is triangular with rounded corners, and is roughly symmetrical above and below. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> soft and entirely devoid of dermal denticles.|$|E

5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
30|$|When primary tumors were > 4 to 6  cm 3, {{surgical}} tumor resection {{was performed}} where indicated. During surgery, a heating pat {{was used to}} maintain body temperature. Routine shaving and disinfecting of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> performed. <b>The</b> tumor including the tumor capsule was carefully dissected from the surrounding tissue. After tumor resection, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> closed using individual sutures (vicryl 3 / 0).|$|R

5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in one session (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December {{of the same}} year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
50|$|The Pawehe technique: which {{developed}} {{solely on the}} island of Niihau., where <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> scraped from <b>the</b> shell in the areas which were to be colored. The gourd was then soaked in dye of the desired color. After the color had soaked into the shell, the gourd was removed from the solution and dried. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> then scraped off, leaving a pattern of dyed and natural colors.|$|R
50|$|The {{skeleton}} of Laccognathus was structured such that {{large areas of}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>were</b> stretched out over solid plates of bone. This bone was composed of particularly dense fibers—so dense that cutaneous respiration (exchange of oxygen through <b>the</b> <b>skin)</b> <b>was</b> not a likely trait exhibited by Laccognathus. Rather, the dense ossifications may have served to retain water inside the body as Laccognathus traveled on land between bodies of water.|$|R
