5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, <b>the</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>to</b> Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot with the {{anamorphic}} process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also {{made use of}} telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; {{most of the people in}} the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch. The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E
5|$|When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was {{in danger}} of {{extinction}} after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent played a major part in saving it, doing much to win back the good opinion of orchestral players that Sargent had lost because of his 1936 interview. In the 1960s, Sargent toured Russia, the United States, Canada, Turkey, Israel, India, the Far East and Australia. By the mid-1960s his health began to deteriorate. His final conducting appearances were on 6 and 8 July 1967, leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival. On 6 July Sargent conducted Holst's The Perfect Fool, Henryk Wieniawski's Second Violin Concerto with Itzhak Perlman, and Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony. On 8 July he led Vaughan Williams's Overture to The Wasps, Delius's <b>The</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>to</b> the Paradise Garden, Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 4 with David Bar-Illan, and Sibelius's Symphony No. 2.|$|E

25|$|Gregory VII {{had already}} left Rome and had intimated to the German princes that he would expect their escort for his journey on 8 January 1077 to Mantua. But this escort had not {{appeared}} when he received the news of Henry's arrival. Henry, who had travelled through Burgundy, had been greeted with enthusiasm by the Lombards, but resisted the temptation to employ force against Gregory. He chose the unexpected course of forcing Gregory to grant him absolution by doing penance before him at Canossa, where he had taken refuge. <b>The</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>to</b> Canossa soon became legendary.|$|E

500|$|In 1924, Howe and Eleanor collaborated {{to arrange}} for Franklin to give the speech to {{nominate}} New York governor Alfred E. Smith {{as a presidential candidate}} at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Franklin initially felt the idea was too risky, knowing that if he fell down before the convention due to his limited mobility, his political career would be effectively over, but Howe and Eleanor persuaded him to attempt it. When the convention came, Franklin successfully walked to the podium with the aid of crutches and his son James Roosevelt and received an ovation from the crowd. <b>The</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the podium and Franklin's speech, in which he famously nicknamed Smith the [...] "Happy Warrior," [...] has been regarded by later historians as the key moment in Franklin's political resurgence.|$|E

The unstable condition of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound prevented them from completing the journey to the Cape Evans base. Conditions at Hut Point were gloomy and depressing, with an unrelieved diet and no normal comforts; Mackintosh in particular found the squalor of the hut intolerable, and dreaded the possibility that, caught at Hut Point, they might miss {{the return of the}} ship. On 8 May 1916, after carrying out reconnaissance {{on the state of the}} sea ice, Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward were prepared to risk <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Cape Evans.

500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was {{recognised}} beyond the guns by Prince Radziwill, an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war. Considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to [...] "fight the enemy among private soldiers" [...] Cardigan turned about and made his way steadily—he himself said that his return was at <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> avoid any unseemly appearance of haste—for his own lines. Lucan recalled things differently, later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being watched. This hurried retreat was also noticed by General Liprandi, Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack. Officers and men of the second and third lines—men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible—were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat. Other officers too had noticed his absence and when Lord George Paget of the 4th Hussars, one of the last to return after some intense, hand-to-hand fighting, encountered a [...] "composed" [...] Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan's reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken his regiments into the attack that day. Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan's attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe's book Letters went on sale.|$|E

2500|$|Gregory had perhaps been {{inspired}} by his victory over the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV in <b>the</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>to</b> Canossa that year. In his letter he promised to send two legates to Spain, Bishop Amadeus of Olorón and Abbot Frotard of Saint-Pons-de-Thomiéres. It is certain that these legates never entered Alfonso's kingdom, although they were in Catalonia in late 1077 and early 1078, and that the king and his ally, Abbot Hugh I of Cluny, requested another legate. In a papal letter dated 7 May 1078 Gregory confirmed that he was sending Cardinal Richard to Castile [...] "as the King of Spain has asked and your counsel has desired" [...] (sicut rex Hispaniae rogavit et vos consilium dedistis). Alfonso had already been described as [...] "King of the Spains" [...] (Hispaniarum rex) {{in a letter to}} Hugh of Cluny on 10 July 1077.|$|E
