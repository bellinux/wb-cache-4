5|$|After some time, a 14-month-old child {{disappeared}} from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was unable or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Tiny's gym and {{intervening}} in a spar <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> Diana asks the trainers {{to let her}} box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead {{and returns to the}} gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E

5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|The crowd roared in {{approval}} and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser's hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered {{one of the}} largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, {{even though he}} was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose <b>to</b> not <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported William Worthy and Rockwell Kent in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Colwell {{served as}} the senior Defense {{attorney}} for Guantanamo captive Ahmed Ghailani, prior to his transfer to the US civilian justice system.

The Banda Oriental was finally conquered by the Empire of Brazil. Ramírez and Hereñú also took Santa Fe Province in alliance with Estanislao López.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> {{from the}} charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing {{as a political}} assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Buzz went to Mid-South Wrestling (which {{became the}} Universal Wrestling Federation in 1986) {{and became a}} protégé of Dick Slater's. After Slater won the North American title, he gave the Mid-South TV Title <b>to</b> Sawyer <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> for <b>him.</b> The {{promotion}} tricked Slater into letting Sawyer defend the North American Title (which he promptly lost), and Sawyer then refused to give the TV belt back to Slater.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} June 2006, he did {{a series}} of {{interviews}} in which he criticised John Reid for claiming that the Home Office was [...] "unfit for purpose", and that the Prime Minister ought <b>to</b> have <b>defended</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enable him to continue seeing through the reforms he had initiated when first appointed to the post. However, he did state that although Tony Blair had lost his sense of purpose, he wanted to see Blair continue as PM.|$|R

25|$|A month later, Bonds hired two attorneys, John Burris of Oakland and Todd Schneider of San Francisco, <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> {{against what}} he claimed were false public {{statements}} made against him, including claims that he took steroids. The move was chiefly aimed at Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, who made disparaging remarks about Bonds in an HBO interview with sportscaster Bob Costas. Bonds dismissed Schilling's comments.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Vander Ark was {{contacted}} by Roger Rapoport, President of RDR Books, and {{asked about the}} possibility of publishing a for-profit print version of the site. Although Vander Ark had previously claimed he had no interest in doing so, Rapoport assured Vander Ark that such a publication would be legal. To further pacify Vander Ark's concerns, he added an addendum to the contract that stated that RDR Books would act <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> in any future lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, Mos Def {{was ordered}} to leave South Africa and not return for five years, having stayed in the country {{illegally}} on an expired tourist visa granted in May 2013. Also that month, he was charged with using an unrecognized World Passport and having lived illegally in South Africa since 2014. Mos Def had reportedly recruited Kanye West <b>to</b> help <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> and posted a message on West's website announcing his retirement from show business. There is an ongoing court case in relation to immigration offences involving the artist and his family.|$|R
50|$|On 3 April, {{the letter}} {{featuring}} Horace Walpoles hoax on Rousseau {{was published in}} a British daily without mention of Walpole being the actual author; that {{the editor of the}} publication was Humes personal friend compounded Rousseaus grief. Gradually articles critical of Rousseau started appearing in the British press; Rousseau felt that Hume, as his host, ought <b>to</b> have <b>defended</b> <b>him.</b> Moreover, in Rousseaus estimate, some of the public criticism contained details which only Hume was privy to. Further, Rousseau was aggrieved to find that Hume had been lodging in London with Francois Tronchin, son of Rousseaus enemy in Geneva.|$|R
5000|$|He led the Irish Locomotive Drivers Association and is {{the former}} {{secretary}} of the ESB Group of unions. He was the first non-ESB employee to become secretary of the GoU.

Throughout this time he was, according to the Irish Independent, [...] "subject to much adverse media comment" [...] and he and his family endured threats to kill them. Among those <b>to</b> publicly <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> were former Irish presidential candidate Fergus Finlay.|$|R
25|$|Expelled {{from his}} Cluj University chair in 1945, Herseni managed to publish one more brochure, with Editura Clujana of Bucharest: Originile sociologiei ("The Origins of Sociology").

Sentenced, he did time in Jilava and Aiud, before being released in 1956. He received an interdiction to publish and was entirely marginalized in society, turning to ghostwriting for more politically suitable scholars.|$|E
25|$|After being refused {{food for}} two days, Khadr {{announced}} he was launching a hunger strike, which led to his collapse on his fifth day and his being transferred to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. He was interviewed in hospital, where he denounced Foreign Minister Assef Ahmad Ali's claim that he had financed the explosives, detonation devices, and both vehicles used in the bombing. He stated that his work consisted solely of charitable work to provide food and schooling to Afghan orphans. Foregoing legal advice, he also refused to hire a lawyer <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> Suffering from a urinary tract infection due to weight loss, he claimed {{that he had been}} targeted simply because of his Egyptian background.|$|E
25|$|In late February, Gallinger {{was visiting}} {{his family in}} Port Colborne when he {{received}} a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, {{the general manager of}} the Bruins, Art Ross, was questioning all the Boston players one-by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger he knew he was involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a psychiatrist in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was looking for a way <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action {{if he was going}} to be sentenced to less than six months in prison, stressing that he wanted to give an example of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him</b> in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E
25|$|Outside, Tormund {{moves to}} kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is {{ultimately}} unable {{to kill the}} innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him,</b> Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold off the other wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and {{heading back to the}} Wall. At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family, and they depart shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{with the}} design's {{stability}} {{could no longer}} be ignored even at the time, and in 1888 an enquiry into the collapse was set up. In February of that year, realising that he could be in legal trouble, Lawson applied to the enquiry to be allowed counsel <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> <b>him.</b> During the enquiry all involved in the construction - including the contractor, the head of the Public Works Department, the projects clerk of works and Lawson himself - gave evidence to support their competence. The enquiry decided that it was the architect who carried the ultimate responsibility, and Lawson was found both 'negligent and incompetent'. This may be considered an unreasonable finding as the nature of the site's underlying bentonite clays was beyond contemporary knowledge of soil mechanics, with Lawson singled out to bear the blame (but this disregards the fact that the site's problems had been pointed out by the surveyors). As New Zealand was at this time suffering an economic recession, Lawson found himself virtually unemployable.|$|E
25|$|Theodoric stipulated with , that if Odoacer {{should be}} vanquished, {{in return for}} his own labors in Odoacer's place he should rule in his stead only until the arrival of Zeno.

He announced his resignation at a Bharatiya Janata Party-sponsored rally of Natwar Singh's own Jat community held at Jaipur {{in the presence of}} Vasundhara Raje, then Chief Minister of Rajasthan.

60|$|The speech produced, {{as might}} have been expected, a great {{division}} among the hearers. Some were more angry than ever, and were eager to put the prophet <b>to</b> death. Others <b>defended</b> <b>him,</b> and insisted {{that he should not}} die. The latter, for the time, prevailed. Jeremiah was set at liberty, and continued his earnest expostulations with the people on account of their sins, and his terrible annunciations of the impending ruin of the city just as before.|$|R
