But, in truth, Mr. Russert, any human being who gives themself over to the doing of evil could be {{considered}} a devil. In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, it talks about the fall of Babylon. It says Babylon is fallen because she has become the habitation of devils. We believe that that ancient Babylon is a symbol of a modern Babylon, which is America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Byansy-Alzumy-Ann! {{who taught}} {{you to call}} me marm! Is this <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned your catechism? Say, ma', this instant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall we {{introduce}} ourselves?" [...] said Ashe. [...] "Or did Mrs. Bell {{tell you}} my name? By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not been here long, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a fishing-rod amongst your things; if {{you find}} the time hang heavy on your hands to-morrow, or wish {{to keep out of}} <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better come over to Bratham Lake and fish. There are some very large carp and perch there, and pike too, for the matter of that, but they are out of season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thankee, my boy," [...] said Mr. Kemp, bluffly, as {{he helped}} Mrs. Bradshaw in and {{stood with his}} foot on the step. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go back and lock my pocket-book up. I left it on the washstand, and there's best part of a {{thousand}} pounds in it. You can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your trick {{and this}} thing are two entirely {{different}} affairs," [...] continued the colonel. [...] "In the one case, you, in your boyish fashion, tried to square up for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been mistreated. In this case, however, these cadets {{are trying to}} get you into trouble, and if this trick had succeeded, it is just possible that I might have been angry enough to send you and the rest of your family home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{appeal to}} your friends," [...] he said, [...] "they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in {{judgement}} on my case. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not introduced me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you put on}} airs with me, Tom Rover. You are in {{our power}} and you shall suffer for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> treated my father and me in the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do, Greenly," [...] he said, in a mild, quiet tone. [...] "Let run the top-gallant-halyards, {{and haul}} up the fore-sail. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> {{will bring you}} fairly alongside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you are--but not in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> mean. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> made me discontented with myself, that's all, and I'm {{going to}} get out of the tall timber and see if I can't do {{something}} in the big world. I want to win your respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, father," [...] said Frank very warmly, [...] "an Italian gentleman <b>has</b> led <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> it {{said that}} the English hung back." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "Yes; that is {{what took}} my fancy in you, Willis: that generosity, that real gentleness, in spite of <b>the</b> brusque <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> Refinement of <b>the</b> heart, I call it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How you do run on!" [...] she said. [...] "You {{wait and}} find out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to wash dishes and all. We'll see what we see, my fine young whiffet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have had a {{difficult}} task, Mr. Festing, and I must thank you for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> carried it out. We won't speak of it again; but perhaps if Muriel Gardiner----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll grieve at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> used {{your poor}} brother {{one of these}} days, Harold,' quietly {{answered}} his mother, so low, that Alfred could not hear through the floor. 'Now, you'll please to go to bed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and change}} your dress, then," [...] he {{retorted}} with a sneer, [...] "then {{you can go}} out by <b>the</b> back <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> put <b>the</b> key away somewhere, haven't you? You know where it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And oh! aunt, {{he asked}} me whether we ever went to Brogden; and when he heard {{that we had been}} at the parsonage, he said he lived there {{when he was a little}} boy, and our nursery was his;' chattered on Helen. 'He asked if we were in the fire; and you know Johnnie can't bear to hear of that; so I told him how funny it was when you came and pulled me out of bed, and we went down the garden with no shoes. And he asked whether that was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> grown so ugly, Aunt Theodora.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is well," [...] said he. [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> captain, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> served me in {{many ways}} of late, and always with success. I hear, Louvois, that De la Salle is dead of the small-pox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You hardly deserve it, Jack, after <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{spoken of}} me. Don't you remember," [...] she added, {{cautiously}} leading {{him back to}} the point, [...] "I used to make your lemonade when you were ill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{hear that}} Sir John Moore {{is going to}} march into Spain. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got some cousins in Oporto or the neighbourhood, though I don't suppose {{you are likely to}} run against them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} amended in future," [...] said the King.--"Hark ye, sirrah Blood, if you again presume to thrust {{yourself}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done but now, I {{will have the}} hangman's knife and your knavish ears made acquainted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not at all}} necessary," [...] said Mainwaring, quietly; [...] "you {{would only}} disturb them in their {{household}} duties. I'll tell them what I've done with you, if they ask. You'll find your stick and hat in the passage, and you can leave the veranda by these steps. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better manage at the Summit to get some one to bring my traps from here to be forwarded to Sacramento to-morrow. I'll want a conveyance, or a horse of some kind, myself, for I've given up walking for a while; but we can settle about that to-night. Come early. Good morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing that}} throws {{me off the}} scent," [...] {{continued}} Little Tim, [...] "is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> Injins <b>have</b> got o' holdin' yer tongues, so that a feller can't make out what yer minds are after. Why don't you speak? why ain't you more commoonicative?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wanted revenge--not in <b>the</b> {{ordinary}} <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> brooded over it too long. You understood too well. Once it was I {{who sought}} to revenge myself on you because you would not listen to me! You hurt my pride. Everything that was evil in me rebelled--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's because, when one's {{heart has}} been broken into in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> broken into mine, all sorts of {{weaknesses}} are free to enter--shame, anger, stupid indignation, stupid fears--stupid laughter, too. I wonder what interpretation you are putting on it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you Crockford's point of view," [...] Segerson replied. [...] "He doesn't exactly {{understand}} what your aims are, and wherever he goes he hears nothing but praise of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> treated your tenants and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> tried {{to turn them into}} small landowners. He isn't intelligent enough to realise that there is a principle behind all this. He has simply come to feel that he has a lenient landlord and that he has only to sit still and the plums will drop into his mouth, too. Crockford is one of the weak spots in your system, Lady Jane. There is no place for him or his kind in a self-supporting world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I cannot say as I blame you," [...] was {{the slow}} reply. [...] "Of course, you owe them something, but {{perhaps you can}} pay them back quicker in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> undertaken. Have you any idea in regard to salary?" ...|$|E
5000|$|There are frustrations - {{people who}} lie to you, people who don't {{know what they}} are doing, films that don't turn out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> wanted them to - so, yes, I do {{understand}} Depp would consider retiring. I always ask myself [...] "well, what else could I do?". Making films has never just been a job to me, it's my life. I have some interests outside of acting - I sing and I've written books, for instance - but acting is what keeps me going, it's what I do, it gives life purpose... I'm realistic about the amount of work I can get at my age, but I take what I can, even voice-overs and narration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} {{something}} in that. Of course we might, if he were arrested, allow him to turn Queen's evidence, but there is always a certain feeling against this class of witness. However, we needn't discuss that now. I suppose that we ought to allow {{an hour and a half}} or two hours to get to this place from Gravesend, but you can find that out when you hire the boat. Of course, it will depend a good deal on which <b>way</b> <b>the</b> tide is. By <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better look to that at once; for if it is not somewhere near high tide when we get to Hole Haven there may not be water enough to row up the creek." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{can ever}} {{make you think}} {{anything}} you don't want to," [...] the Colonel, still in his chair, remarked over his pipe. [...] "You've got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want. You want also, from moment to moment, to think such desperately different things. What happened," [...] he went on, [...] "was that you fell violently {{in love with the}} Prince yourself, and that as you couldn't get me out of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to take some roundabout course. You couldn't marry him, any more than Charlotte could--that is not to yourself. But you could to somebody else--it was always the Prince, it was always marriage. You could to your little friend, to whom there were no objections." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are going}} to make a society call you want your necktie on straight," [...] said Sam. [...] "It's a fine tie, but it's no good <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> it tied. Here, let me fix it," [...] and he pulled the tie loose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} have been busy enough, Richard," [...] responded Mrs. Dare fondly. [...] "I am well {{satisfied}} with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> planted the garden; and no carpenter {{could have made a}} neater job of the front fence. You haven't wasted your time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You want pulling up, after <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been {{indulging in}} a {{reckless}} extravagance which, I {{feel compelled to}} point out, is new to you. The check drawn in favor of Gerald Chisholm rather astonished me. Have you said anything about it to his relatives?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{have talked}} over, Filippo and I, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> best go, {{and we both}} agree that the journey south would be {{altogether}} too dangerous. It will naturally be supposed that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> gone that <b>way,</b> and <b>the</b> news will be sent down by horsemen, so that the troops and the authorities {{will be on the}} look-out for you everywhere. We both think that, although the journey is very long and toilsome, your best plan will be to ride straight inland, cross the Andes, and come down into Brazil. You {{are not likely to be}} questioned on that line, which no one would imagine that you would be likely to take. You may meet with adventures on <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> but <b>you</b> English people are fond of adventures. At any rate that plan will be safer for you, and indeed for us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better stand guard," [...] I replied. [...] "If any {{one comes}} {{get them out}} of the {{forecastle}} <b>the</b> best <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> a chisel or something like it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{were quite}} right. I hate bandboxes: {{they are always}} in <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> would <b>have</b> liked Cy-thera if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been in the least in love. High rocks and green knolls, bowery woods, winding walks, and delicious sunsets. I have not been there much of late,' {{continued}} the Goddess, looking somewhat sad and serious, 'since--but I will not talk sentiment to Ixion.' ...|$|R
