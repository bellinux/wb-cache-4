6000|$|Now {{there are}} two primary classes of idea about {{government}} {{in the modern world}} depending upon our conception of the political capacity of the common man. We may suppose he is a microcosm, with complete ideas and wishes about the state and the world, or we may suppose that he isn't. We may believe that the common man can govern, or we may believe that he can't. We may think further along the first line that he is so wise and good and right that we only {{have to get out of}} his way for him to act rightly and for the good of all mankind, or we may doubt it. And if we doubt that we may still believe that, though perhaps [...] "you can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time," [...] the common man, expressing himself by a majority vote, still remains the secure source of human wisdom. But next, while we may deny this universal distribution of political wisdom, we may, if we are sufficiently under the sway of modern ideas about collective psychology, believe that it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>poke</b> <b>up</b> the political indifference and inability of the common man as much as possible, to thrust political ideas and facts upon him, to incite him to a watchful and critical attitude towards them, and above all to secure his assent to the proceedings of the able people who are managing public affairs. Or finally, we may treat him as a thing to be ruled and not consulted. Let me at this stage make out a classificatory diagram of these elementary ideas of government in a modern country.|$|E

6000|$|The stalks were in heaps {{all over}} the field, and we were allowed the {{privilege}} of setting fire to them. 'Twas glorious! In {{a few minutes the}} field was alight with blazing bonfires, over which rolled great, pungent clouds of smoke. From pile to pile we ran, shrieking with delight, <b>to</b> <b>poke</b> each <b>up</b> with a long stick and watch the gush of rose-red sparks stream off into the night. In what a whirl of smoke and firelight and wild, fantastic, hurtling shadows we were! ...|$|R
50|$|The Fly Baby was {{designed}} to be a very simple aircraft. For example, the fuel gauge is a stiff wire attached <b>to</b> a float <b>poking</b> <b>up</b> through the gas cap (a common application in the 1930s and 1940s, as seen on Piper and Aeronca light aircraft). The structure is of aircraft-grade spruce and plywood (Bowers did not advocate skimping on the quality of structural wood), covered with doped aircraft fabric. Aileron controls are push-tube, elevator controls are a combination of push-tube and cable, the rudder is cable-controlled.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} two days, though, the weather worsened, making {{protective}} aircraft operations particularly difficult. W. L. Steed plodded through the Atlantic swells, occasionally shipping heavy seas that damaged her decks. By 2 February 1942, visibility had shrunk to about two nautical miles (4 km), and snow was falling. Shortly after noon, when W. L. Steed was between 80 and 90 nmi km {{off the coast of}} New Jersey, the [...] under the command of Werner Winter, already a high scorer in the German U-boat arm with over 30 ships <b>to</b> her credit, <b>poked</b> <b>up</b> her periscope and tracked the plodding tanker. One torpedo soon leapt from the submarines bow torpedo tubes, sped inexorably toward W. L. Steed, and hit her on her starboard side, forward of the bridge and in number 3 tank. The explosion touched off a fire in the oil drums stored there.|$|R

Always think you know more than I do--and always swearing it isn't so--and always taking the words out of my mouth, and--but what's the use of arguing with you? As I was saying, the snakes began waking {{about the same time}} I did; I could hear them turn over on their other sides and sigh. Presently one raised himself up and yawned. He meant well, but it was not the regular thing for an ophidian to do at that season. By-and-by they began <b>to</b> <b>poke</b> their heads <b>up</b> all round, nodding good morning to one another across the room; and pretty soon one saw me lying there and called attention to the fact. Then they all began to crowd to the front and hang out over the sides of the beds in a fringe, to study my habits. I can't describe the strange spectacle: you would have supposed {{it was the middle of}} March and a forward season! There were more worms than I had counted, and they were larger ones than I had thought. And the more they got awake the wider they yawned, and the longer they stretched. The fat fellows in the hammocks above me were in danger of toppling out and breaking their necks every minute.|$|R

5000|$|The span loop {{is known}} for being {{extremely}} easy to untie. The beginning of tying this knot begins with tying a Half Sheepshank, which {{is also known as}} a Bell Ringer's Knot. In order to tie this, a one handed twist method is recommended for making a bowline. One bight or loop will <b>poke</b> <b>up</b> through the half-hitch, and it will perfectly match the end of the rope that is also <b>poking</b> <b>up</b> through the signature half-hitch part of a bowline as it is done with the one hand twist method. The next {{thing to do is to}} push the bottom loop back up and through the top loop.|$|R

50|$|Munkácsy is {{a crater}} on Mercury. Munkácsy {{originally}} had a double-ring basin structure, {{but most of}} the inner ring was buried when the basin was flooded with volcanic lava.

5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads <b>poking</b> <b>up</b> through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|R
50|$|As a {{child in}} the 1920s Skirvin curiosity got the best of him {{including}} a dynamite explosion and a near deafening joy-ride.

50|$|The {{species is}} common in {{eucalypt}} or mixed forests and is mycorrhizal, forms {{a close relationship with}} the roots of eucalypts or closely related trees. Although considered solitary, the mushroom can commonly be found in groups of two or three, often <b>poking</b> <b>up</b> through bark and leaf litter on the ground. It can thrive in recently burnt forests and can also be found in suburban lawns.|$|R
50|$|The {{runway surface}} is hard-packed dirt, but it {{develops}} numerous pockets of very soft sand after many days without rain, {{so it is}} important to carry power and keep moving in order to avoid getting stuck.
