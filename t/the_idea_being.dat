5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{a study of the}} main character's, Colonel Jacque's, misconception of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a complete gentleman in Daniel Defoe's The History of Colonel Jacque. In this thesis, the thesis writer needs to know the factor that causes Colonel Jacque's misconception of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a complete gentleman, and his idea about what a gentleman is. To analyze the novel, the thesis writer uses library research, consists of critics' opinions, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a gentleman and also some data about the novel and the author; and literary approach concerning characterization. In the analysis, the thesis writer assumes that Colonel Jacque's innocence is the factor that leads him to his misconception of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a complete gentleman. Because of his innocence, he knows nothing of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a gentleman. His misconception of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> a complete gentleman is shaped as {{he wants to be a}} gentleman; while on the other hand, he does not know the proper manners owned by a complete gentleman. His innocence makes him take every action he considers as the attitude possessed by a gentleman. He does not know whether the action is really not the proper attitude possessed by a true gentleman...|$|R

30|$|Teachers’ {{communication}} about {{connections among}} mathematical ideas may {{be crucial to}} students’ learning about them. Several previous studies have sought to document how teachers communicate about connections among ideas in instruction in classroom settings (Alibali et al., 2014; Richland, Zur, & Holyoak, 2007). These past studies have established that teachers often refer to <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>being</b> connected using both speech and gestures. For example, Richland et al. (2007, p. 1129) identified comparative gestures (e.g., “pointing {{back and forth between}} a scale and an equation”) as one technique that teachers use to support students’ understanding of instructional analogies, a common form of connection-making. In this research, we investigate whether student learning is best supported when teachers refer to <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>being</b> connected using gestures as well as speech.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This is incorrect, as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops {{were long}} {{thought to have}} {{possibly}} used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as Tyrannosaurus, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> discussed first by C. H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that Tyrannosaurus did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that if Tyrannosaurus attacked a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns. Tyrannosaurus is also known to have fed on Triceratops. Evidence for this includes a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and sacrum.|$|E

5|$|With {{the area}} having a {{generally}} low density and lacking transit-oriented development, the Metrorail {{was designed as}} a park and ride system, with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> that suburban residents would drive to the stations, then commute {{the rest of the way}} into the city. Nearly all of the stations outside of downtown Miami have parking facilities, except Tri-Rail Station. Several have large parking garages, such as Dadeland North and South stations, located at the southern end of the system, which combined have space for over 3,000 cars. Earlington Heights, located just northwest of Downtown and adjacent to Interstate 95 and the Airport Expressway, has a large garage that was formerly dedicated to Metrorail riders. However, that is now used by the county due to the station's low ridership, with only 95 vehicle spaces currently available. The successful Dadeland garages are at or over capacity, with two of Metrorail's proposed extensions, the West Kendall Corridor and South Link, intended to help alleviate them. The two northernmost stations, which are located near the Palmetto Expressway, Palmetto and Okeechobee, appeal to Broward County commuters with nearly 2,000 combined spaces. Additionally, the proposed North Corridor to the Broward/Miami-Dade county line would have included five park and ride facilities totaling 2,650 spaces. In the late 1990s, the plan was to potentially even continue the Metrorail line into Broward County along 27th Avenue (University Drive), ending at Broward Boulevard near Broward Mall in Plantation.|$|E
5|$|The four Borodino-class battlecruisers (also {{referred}} to as Izmail class) of the Imperial Russian Navy were all laid down in December 1912 at Saint Petersburg for service with the Baltic Fleet. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of World War I slowed their construction still further as the foreign orders were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into things more immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915–16, but {{the outbreak of the}} Russian Revolution in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The Soviet Navy gave consideration to completing the ships; initially, Izmail and Borodino were looked at, with a view to finishing one or both to their original design, but the lack of available 12in guns, combined with the complexity of the originally designed electrical system, led to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> dropped. Subsequently, plans were raised to complete Kinburn and Navarin to a modified design with 16in guns, which again failed due to the difficulty in either obtaining guns from overseas, or manufacturing them domestically. Subsequent ideas included converting some of the hulls for cargo or passenger use, which again failed. The Navy made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering {{on the part of the}} Red Army. Eventually, all four hulls were broken up for scrap; the second, third and fourth were sold to a German company in 1923, while Izmail was broken up in Leningrad in 1931.|$|E

25|$|Other {{critics have}} {{suggested}} that when people with negative self-views seek unfavorable evaluations, they do so {{as a means of}} avoiding truly negative evaluations or for purposes of self-improvement, with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>being</b> that this will enable them to obtain positive evaluations down the road. Tests of this idea have failed to support it. For example, just as people with negative self-views choose self-verifying, negative evaluators even when the alternative is being in another experiment, they choose to be in another experiment rather than interact with someone who evaluates them positively. Also, people with negative self-views are most intimate with spouses who evaluate them negatively, despite the fact that these spouses are relatively unlikely to enable them to improve themselves. Finally, in a study of people's thought processes as they chose interaction partners, people with negative self-views indicated that they chose negative evaluators because such partners seemed likely to confirm their self-views (an epistemic consideration) and interact smoothly with them (a pragmatic consideration); self-improvement was rarely mentioned.|$|E

40|$|According to the Italian philosopher Antonio Rosmini (1797 - 1855), being is {{an innate}} idea that is {{requisite}} for contemplating anything. He emphatically {{claims that it}} is the one and only innate idea. Rosmini makes a sharp distinction between sensations and perceptions. Perceptions are thought to arise when <b>the</b> undetermined <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> (tantamount to possibility) is combined with sensations, universals when being is combined with perceptions. It is argued here that Rosmini’s explanation of the origin of universals does not work. If <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> is regarded as innate, then several others should be similarly regarded, notably <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of qualitative identity which is an idea necessary for deriving universals.   Although Rosmini holds that certain properties are necessarily present in real objects and therefore implicit in <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being,</b> <b>the</b> property of being qualitatively identical with something else is not among those properties. Theological motives may have encouraged  Rosmini to emphasize being as a peculiarly fundamental <b>idea.</b> However, if <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>being</b> is more fundamental than other universals, it may be regarded so in virtue of its generality,  not because it has a uniquely innate character...|$|R
