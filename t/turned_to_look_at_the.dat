60|$|Jimmy <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newcomer, {{and saw the}} Lizard {{directly}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|They <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bird, which fluttered {{its wings}} and {{stared back at}} them with its big eyes.|$|E
60|$|But when Boabdil was {{crossing}} the mountains he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city he had lost, {{and burst into}} tears.|$|E
60|$|The Major gave an {{involuntary}} start, and then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him curiously.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Andre {{across the}} wide space that now {{separated}} them.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Joe again. He {{was staring}} as blankly as ever.|$|R
60|$|Edgar {{laughed as}} he shook the {{man by the}} hand, and as he rode off <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene around him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't know," [...] said Button-Bright, who {{was half}} scared. Polly whirled {{away to a}} {{distance}} and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> copper man in a fright.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Today's Thursday, isn't it?' Puck <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old pink {{farmhouse}} {{across the}} little valley. 'Mrs Vincey's baking day. Bread should rise well this weather.' He yawned, and that set them both yawning.|$|E
60|$|Trot <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{her sweet}} face was grave and curious.|$|R
60|$|This time he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|R
60|$|A picador {{passes on}} horseback in his uncouth clothes, and all <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|I now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] "boy," [...] who {{was sitting}} on his pony with both eyes nearly shut, and a smile so wide that the double row of his teeth {{were exposed to the}} very last grinders! ...|$|E
60|$|Yeovil {{stared at}} the man and then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> small neatly-printed notice to which the {{official}} was imperiously pointing; in two languages it was made known that it was forbidden and verboten, punishable and straffbar, {{to walk on the}} grass.|$|E
6000|$|... "'A Daniel come to judgment' indeed," [...] {{reflected}} Hadden, who {{had been}} watching this savage comedy with interest; [...] "our love-sick friend has got more than he bargained for. Well, that comes of appealing to CÃ¦sar," [...] and he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two suppliants.|$|E
60|$|In sheer amazement M. Binet {{checked in}} his stride, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his companion.|$|R
60|$|Alora <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her father. He was filing {{his pipe}} and scowling more darkly than ever.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} the prince <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his sister. She was gazing earnestly into his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't you fling it {{over the}} wall, as I did the cat?" [...] asked Mr. Dover, smiling, as he shut up the truant fowl, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rosy, breathless child, whose pink frock bore the marks of many a tumble on grass and gravel.|$|E
60|$|All <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Thing, and {{so quickly}} had the wish been granted that the Gump lay before them in perfect repair, {{and as well}} able to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life {{on the roof of}} the palace.|$|E
60|$|Barney <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl, a {{question}} in his eyes. Before them stood the soldiers with drawn revolvers, and now at {{the summit of the}} hill a dozen more appeared in command of a sergeant. They were two against nearly a score, and Barney Custer was unarmed.|$|E
60|$|She neither <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him nor spoke. No ghost or {{stranger}} {{could have}} passed more silently.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me again. For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|R
60|$|Receiver <b>to</b> ear, he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Paula. Graham, {{bending over}} her but not {{touching}} her, met his eyes.|$|R
60|$|I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old man, {{who was in}} the rear, {{marching in}} good order, and acting as if on some {{pleasure}} excursion which he hoped would not come to an end too soon. It shamed me to see him so jolly when I was feeling so sore.|$|E
60|$|The {{policeman}} whistled and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark windows; he {{then took}} a step towards the door, as though to knock, a course which had infallibly proved our ruin; but seeing us already hurrying down the street under our double burthen, thought better or worse of it, and followed in our wake.|$|E
60|$|Anon {{he raised}} his head a little and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the cliff. On hands and knees, like a {{gigantic}} reptile, he crawled, then lay flat on the ground, on the extreme edge, his eyes peering down into those depths wherein floating vapors lolled and stirred, with subtle movements like spirits in unrest.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{walked slowly}} to the bow. As he did this, Wingate <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him in a {{speculative}} way.|$|R
60|$|James {{shrugged his}} shoulders, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Mary, who was coming towards him with letters in her hand.|$|R
60|$|James <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his uncle, noting {{a little}} contemptuously {{the change of}} his costume, and its extravagant juvenility.|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} {{sound of her}} sweet voice, I <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speaker. She was a girl, perhaps {{a year or two}} younger than myself, very slender and graceful, and with eyes like a mother's. She wasn't exactly pretty, but her face was so full of {{intelligence}} and expression that it was worth a great deal more than any doll-like prettiness.|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} lifted his arm, and drew {{herself out of}} the chair. Siegmund looked at her from his tranquillity. She put the damp hair from her forehead, breathed deep, almost panting. Then she glanced hauntingly at her flushed face in the mirror. With the same restlessness, she <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> night. The cool, dark, watery sea called to her. She pushed back the curtain.|$|E
60|$|I stood there, resting, for a moment, preparatory {{to turning}} and {{retracing}} my {{steps to the}} launch, when, without warning, something whizzed through space straight toward me. There was a dull thud of impact as it struck the tree, and as I dodged {{to one side and}} <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thing I saw a heavy spear imbedded in the wood not three inches from where my head had been.|$|E
50|$|The {{project is}} now <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a more {{permanent}} station within Corwen, with permanent facilities, and a run round loop.|$|R
60|$|He {{straightened}} his tie {{in front of}} the looking-glass and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her with something like wonder in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Bub gave a gasp. He came {{up beside}} her {{and stared at the}} money. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Sarah Judd.|$|R
