40|$|BACKGROUND Skin {{grafting}} is {{the most}} common method used for wound coverage in Plastic Surgery. Firm contact of the skin graft with the graft bed is essential for good take. Tie-over dressing is essential for this. Numerous methods have been described for this purpose. AIM To introduce a new method of tie-over dressing - “Tent in” technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this method, sterile synthetic hand towel is used for graft fixation along with sponge and staples. The sterile synthetic hand towel is available along with the disposable <b>theatre</b> <b>gown.</b> It is a type of synthetic nonwoven cloth, which is stretchable only in one direction. This method was tried in 30 patients with various indications and over different sites. RESULTS The patient group consisted of 18 males and 12 females. The age ranged from 16 yrs. to 71 yrs. (mean 51. 2 yrs.). Among 30 cases included in this study, the graft take was excellent in all except two. In all cases in which this procedure was used, there were no seroma or haematoma under the skin grafts. CONCLUSIONS ‘Tent in’ technique is a novel method for placing tie-over dressing. This method is simple, fast and easy to practice. Excellent graft take is obtained by this technique. KEYWORDS ‘Tent in’ Technique, Tie-Over Dressing, Sterile Hand Towel, Split Skin Graf...|$|E
50|$|As Del and Rodney {{arrive at}} Cassandra's room in <b>theatre</b> <b>gowns,</b> Del tells Rodney {{that he has}} to be comforting and {{understanding}} as well as talk about the future, not the past or present. The Trotter Brothers enter, and Cassandra tearfully says that she is sorry. To Rodney's surprise, Del begins to cry. Rodney tries his best to comfort his wife and tell her that things just happen. Del agrees and leaves the room sobbing. Cassandra then says that she lost the baby, but Rodney tells her that they will get through this. Cassandra smiles and hugs her husband.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} to {{and transfer}} between surfaces {{is a complicated}} process. With regard {{to the success of}} biomaterials implants, studies on bacterial adhesion and transfer should not be confined to biomaterials surfaces in the human body, but also encompass surfaces in the operating room, where the origin of many biomaterials related infections is found. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the transfer of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes from one operating room material to another, while accounting for surface hydrophobicity and roughness, moistness and application of friction during transfer. The tested operating room materials were gloves, broaches (orthopaedic drills), <b>theatre</b> <b>gowns,</b> and light handles. As a possible clinical intervention method to prevent transfer, it was investigated whether dipping the gloves in a chlorhexidine splash-basin affected the viability of the transferred bacteria. Transfer (moist and without friction) was demonstrated to some extent with all bacterial strains and with every material, ranging from 17 % to 71 %, and was influenced by the bacterial strain, moistness of the inoculum, the application of friction, and the characteristics of both the donating and the receiving surface. Dipping the glove material in 4 % or 0. 4 % chlorhexidine solutions killed all bacteria present, regardless of whether surfaces were dried or moist and thus prevented transfer.

40|$|The {{ability to}} resist fluid {{penetration}} {{was measured in}} body fabric and forearm seams of standard and reinforced non-woven disposable <b>theatre</b> <b>gowns.</b> Six standard use, non-woven gowns showed water strike-through in the body area at pressures ranging between 12. 1 +/- 0. 8 cmH 2 O and 23. 2 +/- 2. 2 cmH 2 O (means +/- 95 % confidence interval). Two products resisted fluid penetration of the forearm seam at pressures {{similar to that of}} the fabric alone (16. 8 +/- 1. 0 cmH 2 O and 18. 6 +/- 0. 9 cmH 2 O respectively) but other standard gowns leaked at significantly lower pressures (range 4. 6 - 6. 9 cmH 2 O). (P < 0. 05, Mann-Whitney U test). Six of seven high-protection gowns proved fluid resistant at a pressure in excess of 50 cm in the reinforced body zone but four reinforced gowns leaked at stitched arm seams at a pressure of less than 10 cmH 2 O despite an inner impermeable layer of fabric covering the forearm. Three gowns with heat or adhesive sealed reinforced arm seams resisted fluid penetration up to a pressure of 50 cmH 2 O. Standard gowns and some reinforced gowns do not offer full protection against forearm contamination through stitched seams. A gown with sealed seams and impermeable fabric should be chosen for high-risk cases...|$|R
5000|$|When the United States entered World War I in 1917, by law of Congress, {{all male}} college {{students}} {{were subject to}} military training. In the spring of 1918, Pitt began to train students for war-related industrial work. The war activity had caused a huge influx of students to Pitt and an equally large shortage of space. Pitt alumni began a fund raising campaign to construct a sorely needed new building. The campaign was deemed a smashing success in that it raised $670,000 ($ in [...] dollars), at the time $70,000 more than was needed due {{at least in part}} to both the excitement of alumni with the championship caliber play of the Pitt football team (national champions or undefeated in 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1920), a $100,000 ($ in [...] dollars) contribution directly from the Athletic Committee's football receipts, and profits from the productions of the student <b>theatre's</b> Cap and <b>Gown</b> Club. During construction which started in January 1920, it was discovered that the hillside was undercut with coal mines, some of which were on fire and emitting smoke upon digging. The mines were filled as construction progressed with the last fire being extinguished about a year after Eberly Hall was completed.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=alumni%20hall;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0092 By 1921 Eberly Hall (then called Alumni Hall), was dedicated and signified a departure from and end to the original design for the University's campus, a hill side Acropolis Plan by Henry Hornbostel. Ironically, Eberly Hall's architect, Benno Janssen, was the runner-up to Hornbostel in a national architectural competition for the design of the original campus plan. http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=00c50130m;node=00c50130m%3A11;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=90;page=root;size=s ...|$|R
