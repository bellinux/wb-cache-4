The double victory is considered by many as the first acting grand slam since there were only two award giving bodies for movies at that time. Before the year ended, Aunor made Minsa'y isang Gamu-gamo (1976). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Corazon de la Cruz, a nurse who wanted to go to America to give a better future for her family, but her brother was shot by an American soldier on the eve of her flight to America.

2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times’ Roger Ebert {{responded to}} these criticisms by saying: Terrence Malick's [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] has been praised for its painterly images and evocative score, but criticized for its muted emotions: Although passions erupt in a deadly love triangle, all the {{feelings}} are somehow held at arm's length. This observation is true enough, {{if you think}} only about {{the actions of the}} adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again recently, I was struck more than ever with the conviction that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten down in her heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.|$|E

I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it."
