25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injector</b> system with a tuned intake manifold and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injector</b> to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the intake manifold is to evenly distribute the combustion mixture (or just air in a direct injection engine) to each intake port in the cylinder head(s). Even distribution is important to optimize the efficiency and performance of the engine. It may {{also serve as a}} mount for the carburetor, <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> fuel <b>injectors</b> and other components of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The TU250x had a twin valve, single {{cylinder}} engine with a closed-loop Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system (marketed as Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV)) and a 32-bit ECU, oxygen sensor, catalytic converter, integral cold-start system, 32mm <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> 10-nozzle <b>injector</b> and a proprietary air injection system (marketed as Suzuki Pulsed-secondary AIR-injection or PAIR) that introduces fresh air from the airbox into the exhaust port to ignite unburned hydrocarbons, reducing emissions. In the United States, the TU does not meet California emissions requirements and has remained a 49-state model.|$|R
50|$|A <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> is {{somewhat}} {{analogous to the}} carburetor in a non-injected engine, although {{it is important to}} remember that a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> is not the same thing as a throttle, and that carbureted engines have throttles as well. A <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> simply supplies a convenient place to mount a throttle in the absence of a carburetor venturi. Carburetors are an older technology, which mechanically modulate the amount of air flow (with an internal throttle plate) and combine air and fuel together (venturi). Cars with fuel injection don't need a mechanical device to meter the fuel flow, since that duty is taken over by injectors in the intake pathways coupled with electronic sensors and computers which calculate how much fuel is needed. However, they do still need a throttle to control the airflow into the engine. The simplest way to do this is to simply remove the carburetor unit, and bolt a simple unit containing a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> and fuel <b>injectors</b> on instead. This is known as <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> injection (called TBI by General Motors and CFI by Ford), and it allows an older engine design to be converted from carburetor to fuel injection without significantly altering the intake manifold design. More complex later designs use intake manifolds, and even cylinder heads, specially designed for the inclusion of injectors.|$|R
5000|$|The L67 is the {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the 3800 Series II L36 and appeared in 1996, {{one year after the}} normally aspirated version. It uses the Eaton Generation III M90 supercharger with a 3.8" [...] pulley, a larger <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> fuel <b>injectors,</b> cylinder heads, and lower intake manifold than the L36 uses. Both engines share the same engine blocks, but compression is reduced from 9.4:1 in the L36 to 8.5:1 for the L67. GM listed the engine output as [...] and 280 lbft Nm of torque, although broad torque span and perhaps conservative rating by GM due to the engine's temperature sensitivities have established a belief in higher actual output. Final drive ratios are reduced in most applications, for better fuel economy and more use of the engine's torque in the low range. Like most 3800 V6s, the engine is well known for its reliability and low maintenance costs. The engine is a popular choice for aftermarket modification thanks to its very strong internals and impressive power gains from basic upgrades. The engine was built in Flint, Michigan and was certified LEV in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The 2001 US F4i {{had a new}} {{subframe}} {{which raises}} the seat by five millimeters allows for more storage room and improved two-tier seat. The new tail unit has less padding and a higher perch for the passenger. The F4i's tail-light is smaller with a new dual-bulb configuration. The F4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer. The new LCD digital display had a speedometer, odometer, clock, engine temperature read-out, amber shift light, and trip meters.The single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure (50 psi). [...] programmed fuel injection — thus the model designation [...] "F4i". In a number of countries, the bike was sold in both the [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "Sport" [...] variants, the Sport having a two-part seat, no grab rail and no main stand (though the main stand mounting holes remained). Fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range, while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions. The injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38 mm <b>throttle</b> <b>bodies.</b> Each <b>injector</b> has four nozzles, and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the F4.|$|R

50|$|On the B1 model, {{the four}} fuel {{injectors}} are mounted {{directly into the}} cylinder head above the inlet ports (hence the EFI system {{was referred to as}} port injection), while the B2/A (DFI) model had the more common <b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> Injection (TBI) where the injectors are mounted into the <b>throttle</b> <b>bodies.</b> With different <b>throttle</b> <b>bodies</b> comes a very slight difference in the air box mounting. The intake rubbers on the B1 are smaller than the B2 so a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> swap is not possible without replacing the inlet rubbers. They are also mounted at a 45 degree angle as the port injector openings are in the way.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|R
50|$|The engine, {{although}} {{rated at}} five litres and , was specially made to withstand racing conditions. The block was specially cast and crankcase was fitted with four bolt main bearing caps. The heads were revised with high-flow intake ports and roller rockers. Special connecting rods, crankshafts, and pistons were fitted {{as well as}} a custom exhaust. The key feature though was the fabled Walkinshaw twin <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> inlet manifold, which had been specially developed for the Group A and featured sequential setup with a smaller and larger <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> This was fitted with a restrictor plate on the larger, secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> which actually let less air through than the smaller <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> Some reports have indicated that as much as 50-60 horsepower can be gained from the removal of the restrictor plates.|$|R

50|$|Most fuel {{injected}} vehicles use a pleated paper filter {{element in the}} form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> with ductwork.

40|$|Abstract: Mathematical {{modelling}} of the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{air flow}} {{is one of}} the first steps in generating a generic spark ignition (SI) engine model for control-oriented development. Typically, the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> flow model is subdivided into components: a one-dimensional isentropic flow law, an empirically derived effective area component and a closed plate leakage term. Of these, only the effective area term presents any difficulty. This paper describes the mathematical formulation and analysis of a generic model for the <b>throttle</b> <b>body.</b> Once the model is formulated, the experimental procedure for the identification and estimation of the numerical values of the elements within the model is described. The primary focus of the analysis procedure is the statistical modelling methods associated with calibrating the effective area term. Non-linear repeated measurement analysis methods are used for this purpose...|$|R
