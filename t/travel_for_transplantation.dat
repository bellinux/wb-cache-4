50|$|Although the World Health Assembly 2004 {{resolution}} was unambiguous in its objection to trafficking and transplant tourism, a comprehensive description of these unethical practices was still needed.

The Istanbul Declaration distinguishes transplant tourism from <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> <b>transplantation.</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> is the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals across jurisdictional borders for transplantation purposes. <b>Travel</b> <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> becomes transplant tourism if (1) it involves organ trafficking and/or transplant commercialism or; (2) if the resources (organs, professionals and transplant centers) devoted to providing transplants to patients from outside a country undermine the country’s ability to provide transplant services for its own population.|$|E

40|$|Many {{nations are}} able to prosecute transplant-related crimes {{committed}} in their territory, but transplant recipients, organ sellers and brokers, and transplant professionals may escape prosecution by engaging in these practices in foreign locations where they judge the risk of criminal investigation and prosecution to be remote. Methods. The Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group convened an international working group to evaluate the possible role of extraterritorial jurisdiction in strengthening the enforcement of existing laws governing transplant-related crimes across national boundaries. Potential practical and ethical concerns {{about the use of}} extraterritorial jurisdiction were examined, and possible responses were explored. Results. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is a legitimate tool to combat transplant-related crimes. Further, development of a global registry of transnational transplant activities in conjunction with a standardized international referral system for legitimate <b>travel</b> <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> is proposed as a mechanism to support enforcement of national and international legal tools. Conclusions. States are encouraged to include provisions on extraterritorial jurisdiction in their laws on transplant-related crimes and to collaborate with professionals and international authorities {{in the development of a}} global registry of transnational transplant activities. These actions would assist in the identification and evaluation of illicit activities and provide information that would help in developing strategies to deter and prevent them...|$|E
40|$|Background-Current {{regulations}} {{require that}} all cardiac allograft offers <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> must include an interpreted 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, {{little is known}} about the expected ECG findings in potential organ donors or the clinical significance of any identified abnormalities in terms of cardiac allograft function and suitability <b>for</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Methods and Results-A single experienced reviewer interpreted the first ECG obtained after brain stem herniation in 980 potential organ donors managed by the California Transplant Donor Network from 2002 to 2007. ECG abnormalities were summarized, and associations between specific ECG findings and cardiac allograft use <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> were studied. ECG abnormalities were present in 51 % of all cases reviewed. The most common abnormalities included voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, prolongation of the corrected QT interval, and repolarization changes (ST/T wave abnormalities). Fifty-seven percent of potential cardiac allografts in this cohort were accepted <b>for</b> <b>transplantation.</b> Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG was a strong predictor of allograft nonuse. No significant associations were seen among corrected QT interval prolongation, repolarization changes, and allograft use <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> after adjusting <b>for</b> donor clinical variables and echocardiographic findings. Conclusions-We have performed the first comprehensive study of ECG findings in potential donors <b>for</b> cardiac <b>transplantation.</b> Many of the common ECG abnormalities seen in organ donors may result from the heightened state of sympathetic activation that occurs after brain stem herniation and are not associated with allograft use <b>for</b> <b>transplantation.</b> © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Currently, {{there is}} {{considerable}} controversy about the place of transplantation {{in the treatment of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study compared resection to transplantation in cirrhotic patients with HCC in order to determine reasonable indications of each treatment. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The usual procedure is to resect when feasible and to transplant in other cases. METHODS: Three-year survival with and without recurrence was analyzed in 60 patients who underwent resection and 60 who underwent transplantation. Several prognostic factors, such as size, number of nodules, portal thrombus, and histologic form, were studied. RESULTS: In terms of overall survival rates, resection and transplantation yield the same results (50 % vs. 47 %, respectively, at 3 years). <b>For</b> <b>transplantation,</b> however, the rate for survival without recurrence is better than that for resection (46 % vs. 27 %, respectively; p 3 cm, or presence of portal thrombus). CONCLUSIONS: The best indication <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> seems to be patients with small and uninodular or binodular tumors; until now, these patients were considered to be the best candidates for resection. Patients undergoing <b>transplantation</b> <b>for</b> unresectable, large, multinodular or diffuse tumors seem to represent bad indications <b>for</b> <b>transplantation.</b> These results could help define reasonable indications <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> in an era with a shortage of liver grafts...|$|R

40|$|Demand for donor hearts exceeds supply, and a {{significant}} number of patients die while awaiting transplantation.

Current methods of assessment are inadequate, and there is a potential for biomarkers to improve identification of satisfactory hearts <b>for</b> <b>transplantation</b> or hearts destined to fail in the recipient. Biomarkers are routinely used to diagnose and risk-stratify myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, and heart failure. Some of these might facilitate donor heart assessment.
