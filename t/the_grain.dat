5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving.

5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are a threat to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead {{and many of the}} rest are dying, alerting them that <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> has been poisoned.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grains</b> {{vary from}} coarse pebbly grits to shale. <b>The</b> finer <b>the</b> <b>grains,</b> <b>the</b> darker their color. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> are {{cemented}} primarily by quartz, with iron oxide coating <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b>|$|R
50|$|For each {{grain size}} {{there is a}} {{specific}} velocity at which <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> start to move, called entrainment velocity. However <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> {{will continue to be}} transported even if the velocity falls below the entrainment velocity due to the reduced (or removed) friction between <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> and <b>the</b> river bed. Eventually the velocity will fall low enough for <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> to be deposited. This is shown by the Hjulstrøm curve.|$|R

5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from <b>the</b> <b>grain.</b> Winnowing removed the chaff from <b>the</b> <b>grain,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|Quantities of niobium {{are used}} in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based {{superalloys}} in proportions as great as 6.5% for such applications as jet engine components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, heat resisting, and combustion equipment.

40|$|The {{ergosterol}} analysis {{proves to}} be a fairly good method to determine quality of <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b> Even with <b>the</b> strict food regulations in Singapore, ergosterol {{was found to be}} presence in <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> brought from <b>the</b> market, suggesting possible mold growth history during harvesting and storage period of <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b> <b>The</b> extraction method used in this project was next tested for repeatability and % recovery to indicate the reliability of the results. Repeatability was good and % recovery was found to be 59 - 69 % for <b>the</b> <b>grains...</b>|$|R
30|$|Next, we {{calculated}} the mean relative velocity between <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> caused by <b>the</b> lift force. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> obtain spin angular momenta with various directions by collisions between themselves, {{so that the}} lift forces exerted on them have various directions as well. Thus, the relative velocity yields between <b>the</b> <b>grains.</b> We assumed that <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> are in <b>the</b> steady state and that the distribution of their spin momenta shows the isotropy. We then showed that the mean relative velocity {{is comparable to the}} gas velocity at the Kepler rotational frame when FL≳ FD and ts ≈ 1 /ΩK, where FL,FD,ts, andΩK are the lift force, the drag force, the stopping time of <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> by <b>the</b> drag, and the Kepler angular velocity, respectively. This means that the lift force can sufficiently affect the collision rate, which affects the growth rate of <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> under <b>the</b> parameter set.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>grains</b> of African rice {{are more}} brittle {{than those of}} Asian rice. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> {{are more likely to}} break during {{industrial}} polishing.

5|$|The {{hospital}} in Kirkuk received {{large numbers of}} patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December. By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating <b>the</b> <b>grain,</b> although dispatches {{did not mention the}} large numbers already ill. The Iraqi Army soon ordered disposal of <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it. Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the River Tigris), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
30|$|Hadamcik et al. (2009 a) have {{presented}} a first {{study of the}} morphology of <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> obtained from SEM-FEG images. <b>The</b> <b>grains</b> are quasi-spherical. Their surface is not completely smooth. Some grains are broken and show radial structures corresponding to the surface irregularities, which fill up each <b>grain</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> grow radially. Some aggregates appear on the images, with just touching grains or with sintered ones. The aggregation may occur in the discharge or when <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> stick to <b>the</b> glass vessel or inside the microvials (Fig. 1).

50|$|A transgranular {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{that follows the}} edges of lattices in a granular material, ignoring <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> in <b>the</b> individual lattices. This results in a fairly smooth looking fracture with less sharp edges than one that follows <b>the</b> changing <b>grains.</b> This can be visualized as several wooden jigsaw puzzle pieces with <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> showing, but with each piece having grains running in a different direction. A transgranular fracture follows <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> in <b>the</b> wood, not {{the edges of the}} puzzle pieces. This is opposed to an intergranular fracture.|$|R

5|$|Baris stubbornly holds Kirk {{responsible}} for this apparent fiasco, and Koloth additionally demands an apology from Kirk after some of the Enterprise crew are provoked into a brawl with the Klingons in the station's bar. However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> with a virus that becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One way of {{generating}} light weight composites is to insert porous ceramic <b>grains</b> into <b>the</b> melt of the matrix.

Therefore, computer tomographic images on two scales are used to analyse the microstructure of <b>the</b> <b>grains</b> as well as the composites.
