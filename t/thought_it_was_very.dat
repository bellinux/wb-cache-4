25|$|When {{an episode}} {{was shown to}} members of the public, to gauge {{audience}} reaction prior to broadcast of the first series, the majority of the audience <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> poor. The production team put the report containing the negative comments at the bottom of David Croft's in-tray. He only saw it several months later, after the series had been broadcast and had received great acclamation.|$|E
500|$|Sociologist Roberto Blancarte {{called the}} {{controversy}} a [...] "persecution" [...] fueled by [...] "obscure interests." [...] Journalist Carlos Monsiváis described {{the issue as}} a defamation campaign. Sociologist Bernardo Barranco {{described it as a}} dirty war that was well exploited by the media. Anthropologist Carlos Garma Navarro criticized that the accusations were first brought before the mass media, and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> likely that the accusations were an attempt to give the church a bad image. Journalist Gastón Pardo called it a smear campaign characterized by the systematic use of defamation and slander.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
5000|$|Oldenlandiopsis is {{a member}} of the [...] tribe Spermacoceae. Within the tribe, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{especially}} close to Oldenlandia, as had <b>been</b> previously <b>thought.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> closely related to, and perhaps [...] sister to Houstonia.|$|R
50|$|The Argentine Constitution of 1853, the new republic's first constitution, {{does not}} contain any {{explicit}} references to citizenship, though {{as a product of}} its framers liberal <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> universalist in spirit, speaking of broad, universal rights that apply to all men. This contrasts with the practice of vecindad, which is by nature individual and nuanced.|$|R

500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> interesting to do so".|$|E
2500|$|A Quinnipiac University poll {{conducted}} January 5–9, 2017, showed that 55% of respondents believed that Russia interfered in the election. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal {{poll conducted}} January 12–15, 51% {{of respondents said}} they believed Russia intervened in the election through hacking. [...] public-opinion polls showed a partisan split on the importance of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 53 percent wanted a Congressional inquiry into communications in 2016 between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Quinnipiac University found that 47 percent <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> important. A March 2017 poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC found about 62% of respondents say they are at least moderately concerned about the possibility that Trump or his campaign had inappropriate contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871, Milton Hershey {{left school}} {{for good and}} was apprenticed to a local printer, Sam Ernst, who {{published}} a German-English newspaper. He did not like {{that kind of work}} and he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> boring. One day at work there, he accidentally dropped his hat in one of the machines. Because his boss was hot-tempered, he was fired shortly after. He was worried to see how his parents would react. His father asked Ernst to take him back, and he did decide to give him a second chance, but Mattie Snavely, his aunt, and his mother had a different idea. They wanted him to learn the trade of candy making instead. [...] So, his mother arranged for the 14-year-old Hershey to be apprenticed to a confectioner named Joseph Royer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Over the next four years, Hershey learned the craft of creating confections. In 1876, he moved to Philadelphia to start his first confectionery business.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Forester,--"but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{much harder}} than any wood which he could get. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> curious wood. He had never seen any like it before." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I {{remember}} we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “It’s {{very good}} of him,” I said. And indeed I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good of him, though I did ask myself vaguely in my dulled brain {{why he should}} be uneasy.|$|R
60|$|Harris said he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> fine maze, {{so far as}} he was a judge; and {{we agreed}} that we would try to get George to go into it, on our way back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Juliana <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> <b>very</b> pretty, if, {{instead of}} [...] those frightful rocks and shabby cottages, {{there could be}} [...] villas, and gardens, and lawns, and conservatories, and [...] summer-houses, and statues.|$|R
60|$|Philip <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> like a French novel, {{and he did}} {{not know}} why it {{slightly}} irritated him.|$|E

60|$|When Forester came {{to examine}} it, {{he said he}} <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> good piece, and when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> planed smooth and varnished, he thought, from its appearance, that <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> of a <b>very</b> pretty color.|$|R
60|$|Nathan <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> curious {{experiment}} to poise a needle so, upon {{a piece of}} cork,--even without the magnetism. And he watched it as it slowly moved about, with a face full of interest and curiosity.|$|R
60|$|Asaph, left alone, {{heaved a}} sigh. He did not despair; but truly, fate was heaping {{a great many}} {{obstacles}} in his path. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> hard thing {{for a man to}} get his rights in this world.|$|R

60|$|Phonny laughed aloud at this assertion, though Malleville {{continued}} to look very serious. Phonny then repeated {{that he did not}} make the kitten go away, and besides, he said, he <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> childish to pretend to tell a story to a kitten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always {{been used}} to {{sleeping}} together--in-fact, prefer it. And I was thinking it was to accommodate me. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good of them, whereas a person situated as that young man is--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nesta told him. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{sporting}} of you. He {{will tell}} Mr Abney anything we like. By the way, Peter, {{you will have}} to pay a premium or something, I suppose. But Nesta will look after all expenses, of course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{seemed to}} like them very well," [...] she replied, [...] "but I do not think they were quite satisfied. From what I heard some persons say, I {{inferred}} that they <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>very</b> much of a show to which you had invited them." ...|$|R
