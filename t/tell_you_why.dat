500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E

2500|$|A common myth {{about this}} story is that the colour-separation overlay (CSO) {{backgrounds}} were accidentally omitted {{in some of the}} car interior scenes, leaving the blue screen behind the characters. In reality, the blue is supposed to represent the sky. The differing shades of blue compared to the location exterior footage {{is the result of the}} shots' separate origins. This is contradicted by Paul Vanezis in an interview, in which he states [...] "I wouldn't put a background in and I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> they didn't put a background in there - it wasn't lit properly. There wasn't enough blue in it to key it, or yellow or green or whatever it was. It was shot wrong. It shouldn't have been shot in the studio and it shouldn't have been shot on xchrome. These days with modern technology you could easily key it... easily, but it wouldn't look right." ...|$|E

But make no mistake... A more charming womanly woman never lived." [...] Copland later wrote that [...] "it was wonderful for me to find a teacher with such openness of mind, while at the same time she held firm ideas of right and wrong in musical matters. The confidence she had in my talents and her belief in me were at the very least flattering and more—they were crucial to my development at this time of my career." [...] Though he planned on only one year abroad, he studied with her for three years, finding her eclectic approach inspired his own broad musical taste.|$|E

2500|$|One {{persistent}} account about Camille {{states that}} 23 people held a [...] "hurricane party" [...] {{on the third}} floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, killing all but one person. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling. An ABC made-for-TV movie called Hurricane, starring Frank Sutton of Gomer Pyle USMC, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Will Geer, Martin Milner, and Michael Learned, was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party. However, the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie, as was the name of the hurricane. The television show Quantum Leap carried an episode regarding the parties of Hurricane Camille and the actual hurricane itself. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died. The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Survivor Ben Duckworth has expressed irritation at the story. There was no hurricane party. Duckworth reiterated in 2001. We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> that story persists, or why people didn't put two and two together. I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.|$|E
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>why</b> I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
