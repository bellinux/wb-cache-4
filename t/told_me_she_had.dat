500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At {{the end of the}} performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, {{transcripts}} of two 2015 affidavits of private investigator Dominic Casey were filed {{on the court}} docket {{in the matter of}} Kronk v. Anthony and picked up by news services in May 2016. In one affidavit, Casey stated that on July 26, 2008, Baez admitted to him that Casey Anthony murdered Caylee Anthony [...] "and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did". He also claimed that Baez had a sexual relationship with Anthony, and that [...] "Casey <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to do what Jose said because she had no money for her defense." [...] Baez [...] "vehemently" [...] denied a sexual relationship.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Do {{you think}} so?' says I; upon which my friend <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{actually}} gone {{down on her}} knees to him and 'Save Colonel Altamont!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{only you}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone some days ago. Well, I am sound again and {{prepared}} to march, but say, how is my foster-son?" ...|$|R
60|$|PARKER. Yes, madam--her ladyship <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left {{a letter}} for his lordship on the table.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Her uncle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been {{considered}} pretty,' remarked Madame Mantalini. 'I think {{her one of}} the most ordinary girls I ever met with.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went down}} to Gardencourt this morning, and the servant <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> come to London. He {{believed}} she was to come to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where is}} Freda?" [...] Edmund, {{who had been}} {{listening}} impatiently, exclaimed. [...] "One of your men <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been carried off. Is it true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I lent him some," [...] Featherstone admitted, hesitatingly. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{afterwards}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{promised to}} make no further claim, and I understand she kept her word." ...|$|R
60|$|When Sophy had {{finished}} her tale, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left her boy in London, {{and had come}} down to devote herself to the task <b>she</b> <b>had</b> so long had before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came to see}} ME. She {{knocked at}} my shabby door. She mounted my squalid stair. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen you at Folkestone." ...|$|E
60|$|When all was still, at a late hour, poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping {{to me and}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{given her}} birds their liberty.|$|E
6000|$|... "If only you'd <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> died," [...] {{he said to}} Jim, [...] "I'd {{have been}} man enough to stand it, but--this--this kills me--I can't breathe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very quietly. Your Aunt Letty <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{spent most}} of her time in prayer since she heard it. But Miss Letty seems to think that on your account she is very full of joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{she did not}} say that. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{declined}} the honour that you <b>had</b> offered her;--that <b>she</b> did not regard you as she must regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I found Anne in a {{state of}} the wildest grief. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen Philip shot by the vicomte, just as he was attacking him, and that you in turn had cut down the villain.|$|R
6000|$|... "For Julia? Is Julia {{so great}} as that? She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the {{greatest}} regard for you. You're {{good enough for}} the best, my dear boy," [...] Mr. Carteret pursued.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} that," [...] said Capell, [...] "she must have {{convinced}} him that she is no enemy spy, for just before they left this morning he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> promised to marry him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Must not I wear it, mamma?' said Constance, who had {{a certain}} {{attachment}} to the beautiful and comfortable garment. 'She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only worn it once in London, {{and she was so}} very kind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A quick blush {{sprang to}} his brow. [...] "You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> no wish apart from her father's, and as I've {{gathered}} {{that he would}} favour me--!" [...] He paused a little and then suggested [...] "Don't you see?" [...] through his blush.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has promised me!" [...] {{interrupted}} the Princess. [...] "Oh! no. I'm sure <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not. <b>She</b> would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> if <b>she</b> <b>had.</b> I am too {{much interested in}} the matter for her to promise anything without my consent--you must be mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{been writing}} to you, but I {{know that you}} are talking of Imogene. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said to you yesterday, and I blamed her for it, but I'm not sure that it wasn't best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; {{very near}} here. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known this old house well years ago, {{when she was}} a girl. She used to visit it in company with her father, a friend of old Señor Cristoval.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Dor. My sister <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen another; [...] A {{man like}} you, {{and she liked}} only him: [...] Therefore, if one must be enough for her, [...] He is that one, and then you cannot have her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} press me, I know more," [...] Gabriel said. [...] "Miriam knows you're engaged to a wonderful, rich lady; {{she told me}} as much, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen her here. That was enough to set her off--she likes {{forbidden}} fruit." ...|$|E
60|$|I quite {{believed}} Leeby when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afterwards that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> watched Jamie feeling {{beneath the}} mattress.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told that--that your father--is alive." [...] He looked down upon her and could see that her face was red up to her very hair. [...] "Your mother once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never been certain of his death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and Oswald {{were away}} {{together}} when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{made up her}} mind. Oswald has hardly spoken to her since {{you have been in}} the house. He certainly has not spoken to her about you since you came to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clementina, [...] "I didn't see {{anything}} of it. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made a will; but she didn't quite like it, {{and sometimes she}} thought she would change it. She spoke of getting you to do it; I didn't know but she had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a few words. She {{came to my}} room {{last night}} and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only a dim {{recollection}} of what took place. She said The Voices {{wanted to talk to}} me--but I didn't want them to talk to me--and said so--and she went away." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{big eyes}} here assumed an {{expression}} that was intended to kill me outright with kindness: from being calm, still, reserved, Angelica suddenly became gay, smiling, confidential, and folatre. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard I was a sad creature, and that she intended to reform me, and that I must come and see Frank a great deal.|$|E
60|$|When {{the two had}} disappeared, Emily, {{no longer}} {{restraining}} her tears, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> exchanged Prayer-books with him, and they were to read the Psalms {{at the same time}} every day. 'I thought it might be a help to him,' she said simply.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{should it}} have been?' the girl asked. 'Warbles <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> could <b>have</b> no {{difficulty}} in proving {{where she was}} at the time.' ...|$|R
60|$|She obeyed, {{staggering}} a {{few paces}} to a stone at the roadside, behind which she crouched. Afterwards <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no strength to go further, and indeed no will, since if we were killed, it were better that <b>she</b> who <b>had</b> warned us should be killed also.|$|R
