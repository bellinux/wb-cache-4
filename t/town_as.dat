5|$|A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter {{established}} Almshouses {{which became}} Harvey's Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building. In 1685 Chard {{was one of}} the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion in which 160 men from Chard joined the forces of the Duke of Monmouth. The subsequent hangings took place on Snowden Hill {{to the west of the}} <b>town.</b> <b>As</b> elsewhere in this area, the 'finger-post' road-sign at this spot is painted red and is known as 'Red Post' to commemorate the executions.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and is a testament to the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval <b>town</b> <b>as</b> a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the <b>town.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a <b>town</b> <b>as</b> early as {{the last quarter of}} the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield <b>Town,</b> <b>as</b> they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers {{would interfere with}} proceedings, the SEF arrived at the capital of Samoa, Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the <b>town</b> <b>as</b> well as the wireless station several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of Samoa with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of Samoa.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it seems that the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} <b>town</b> <b>as</b> part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's Wall with Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th and early 20th centuries the pier was popular both with locals and {{tourists}} to the <b>town.</b> <b>As</b> a boarding point for steamers plying their trade in the Bristol Channel, it underwent various extensions and modifications over the years. During the Second World War the pier was commissioned as HMS Birnbeck by the Admiralty as part of the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development (DMWD) for research into new weapons. The pier reopened after the war, but the number of visitors and steamer passengers declined. The final excursion visited the pier in 1979.|$|E
