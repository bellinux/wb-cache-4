5|$|Grande {{embarked}} {{on her first}} solo concert tour titled <b>The</b> <b>Listening</b> Sessions in support of Yours Truly. Pre-sale tickets went on sale on July 18, 2013. Regular tickets went on sale on July 19. Pre-sale tickets {{had to be taken}} down early, as they were selling at such a fast rate that the tour was almost sold before regular tickets were available. Grande also was the opening act for the last three US dates of Justin Bieber's Believe Tour. The performances took place in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Atlanta on August 7, August 8, and August 10, in support of the album. It was at these Listening Sessions that Grande discovered the album reached number one on US iTunes.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Engineers Signal Service, {{formed in}} 1912, was given {{responsibility}} for communications that included signal dispatch, telegraph, telephone and later wireless communications, from army headquarters to brigade {{and down to}} battery level for the artillery. For most of the war, the Army's primary methods of communication were signal dispatch (employing runners, messengers on horseback, dogs, and carrier pigeons), visual signalling, telegraph, and telephone. At {{the start of the}} war, the Army had a small number of wireless sets, which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated on longwave.

5|$|With over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's Greek Community {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the US. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, and Alpha Phi sorority; the MSU Greek system now {{consists}} of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils: National Panhellenic Conference, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of 9 organizations, 5 Fraternities and 4 Sororities, that were founded on Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU's). The Interfraternity Council and the Women's Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the American Cancer Society, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Big Brothers Big Sisters, <b>The</b> <b>Listening</b> Ear and previous charities include: the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the Special Olympics, in which fraternity and sorority members get to help each other participate.|$|E

25|$|If lossy data {{compression}} {{is used on}} audio or visual data, differences from the original signal will be introduced; if the compression is substantial, or lossy data is decompressed and recompressed, this may become noticeable {{in the form of}} compression artifacts.

25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended triode amps or other tube amplifiers.

The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E

25|$|Small {{listening}} rooms {{suffer a}} paucity of low frequency resonances with gaps between them, so another complementary method is adding a subwoofer to drive the room resonances from an optimal physical location that minimizes ripple in the frequency response at <b>the</b> <b>listening</b> position. Yet another complementary method is splitting an existing subwoofer allocation up into multiple smaller subwoofers in spatially separated locations that increase the degrees of freedom available to tune the response with. Multiple subwoofers also tend to smooth the bass response across a larger listening area and are often easier to place for good bass response than a single larger subwoofer (or no subwoofer).|$|E
