5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as <b>the</b> <b>generic</b> symbol of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired <b>the</b> <b>generic</b> symbol ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E

5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with <b>the</b> <b>generic</b> formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, British {{paleontologist}} Guy Pilgrim described {{two species}} from the Miocene {{of what is}} now India and Pakistan, Sivanasua palaeindica from Chinji (Pakistan) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar (India). He attributed both to Sivanasua, a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe. The next year, American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new genus and species Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar, which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae. <b>The</b> <b>generic</b> name, Indraloris, combines the name of the god Indra with <b>the</b> <b>generic</b> name Loris, and the specific name, lulli, honors Richard Swann Lull, at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History. It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim's Sivanasua species had been misidentified; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli, but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open. Tattersall, who also described additional material of Indraloris, continued to regard the animal as a lorisid.|$|E

M.rotula is also the type species of section Marasmius within the genus. This grouping of species is characterized by inamyloid flesh, a cap cuticle with broom cells (finger-like projections common to Marasmius species) ornamented with numerous warts, gills usually attached to a collar surrounding the stem, and the presence of black rhizomorphs on the stem.|$|E
