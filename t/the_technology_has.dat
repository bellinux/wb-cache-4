5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

25|$|The V-fold belt {{is similar}} to the belt filter press with the main {{difference}} being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. <b>The</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.|$|E
25|$|Chromatography {{technique}} developed substantially as {{a result}} of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s, for which they won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and what would become known as high-performance liquid chromatography. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> {{applications}} {{in a number}} of fields, including molecular biology, pathology, immunology, plant biology and marine biology. It has broad application in medicine especially in transplantation, hematology, tumor immunology and chemotherapy, prenatal diagnosis, genetics and sperm sorting for sex preselection. Also, it is extensively used in research for the detection of DNA damage, caspase cleavage and apoptosis. In neuroscience, co-expression of cell surface and intracellular antigens can also be analyzed. In marine biology, the autofluorescent properties of photosynthetic plankton can be exploited by flow cytometry in order to characterise abundance and community structure. In protein engineering, flow cytometry is used in conjunction with yeast display and bacterial display to identify cell surface-displayed protein variants with desired properties.|$|E
25|$|Antagonistic {{pleiotropy}} is a prevailing theory today, {{but this}} is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may {{be thought of as}} partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.|$|E

500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. <b>The</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> advanced so far in the past couple years." [...] Whedon also said that [...] "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" [...] but [...] "The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Aronofsky {{tried to}} launch {{production}} on Noah, a retelling of the Bible story of Noah's Ark, projected for a $115 million budget. By the following year, the film had secured funding and distribution from New Regency and Paramount Pictures, with Russell Crowe hired {{for the title}} role. The film was adapted into a serialized graphic novel written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel, published in French in October 2011 by the Belgian publisher Le Lombard. By July 2012, Aronofsky's crews were building an ark set in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. Aronofsky announced the start of filming on Noah on Twitter in the same month, tweeting shots of the filming in Iceland. The film featured Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, Logan Lerman, and Jennifer Connelly, with the latter having also starred in Requiem for a Dream. During its opening weekend, Noah held the largest non-sequel opening within Russia and Brazil, and the fourth-largest opening of all time. Aronofsky did not use live animals for the film, saying in a PETA video that [...] "There's really no reason to do it anymore because <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> arrived".
