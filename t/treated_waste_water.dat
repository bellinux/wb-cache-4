40|$|Abstract: Expansion {{of urban}} populations, {{increased}} coverage of domestic {{water supply and}} sewerage give rise to greater quantities of municipal wastewater. With the current emphasis on environmental health and water pollution issues, there is an increasing discharge of <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> in developing countries. Present technologies in developing countries for <b>treating</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> are not sufficient and cost effective. Chlorella vulgaris is a form of green microalgae efficient for pond-based wastewater treatment, rather than bacterial strains for their ability to flocculate Chlorella vulgaris in a culture suspension. A microbial flocculent would be significantly cheaper than traditional flocculants and is believed to be less potentially toxic than synthetic polymers which are currently available. Chlorella vulgaris absorbed more pollutant compared to Chlamydomonas sp., which reveals that Chlorella vulgaris is efficient than Chlamydomonas sp., for <b>treating</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{waste water}} disposal, <b>treated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> is {{injected}} into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting fresh water supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters. Injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation {{in order to prevent}} injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment. Unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques, injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water. This method of waste water disposal also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area, further decreasing environmental impacts.|$|E

[...] Most environmental engineering professionals, however, consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells {{to be the most}} cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatment. The only known alternatives to injection wells are direct discharge of <b>treated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation. Direct discharge does not disperse the water over a wide area; the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody.

The lake outlet is situated in the south-west shore of the lake and flows into Baillie Creek, which is a tributary of Hopkins River.

50|$|The {{proposal}} {{states the}} plant will draw its water from the Passur River, taking up to 219, 600 cubic metres of water everyday. Activists worry about the effect on local water supplies as that means {{the plant will}} discharge <b>treated</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> back into the river.They argue that the pollutants introduced into the water supply can harm the mangroves, the marine animals living there, and nearby human communities who use the water body for fishing and agriculture. Environmentalists are also fearful of the increased chances of a catastrophic oil spill. There is historical evidence of the damage that can cause in the Sundarbans. In 2014, when an oil tanker spilled 75,000 gallons into the fragile ecosystem, locals communities had no tools or assistance from the government to fight the toxic spill with.|$|E
