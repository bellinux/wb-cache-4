40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} event-triggered data trans-mission in distributed networked {{control systems}} with packet loss and <b>transmission</b> <b>delays.</b> We propose a distributed event-triggering scheme, where a subsystem broadcasts its state infor-mation to its neighbors {{only when the}} subsystem’s local state error exceeds a specified threshold. In this scheme, a subsystem is able to make broadcast decisions using its locally sampled data. It can also locally predict the maximal allowable number of successive data dropouts (MANSD) and the state-based deadlines for <b>transmission</b> <b>delays.</b> Moreover, the designer’s selection of the local event for a subsystem only requires information on that individual subsystem. Our analysis applies to both linear and nonlinear subsystems. Designing local events for a nonlinear subsystem requires us to find a controller that ensures that subsystem to be input-to-state stable. For linear subsystems, the design problem becomes a linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. With {{the assumption that the}} number of each subsys-tem’s successive data dropouts is less than its MANSD, we show that if the <b>transmission</b> <b>delays</b> are zero, the resulting system is finite-gain Lp stable. If the delays are bounded by given deadlines, the system is asymptotically stable. We also show that those state-based deadlines for <b>transmission</b> <b>delays</b> are always greater than a positive constant...|$|R
