5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves.

5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled <b>the</b> <b>exploration</b> of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
