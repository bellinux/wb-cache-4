5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever being threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>women</b> who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E

He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. She was often ill in her childhood. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and Ada in turn became Countess of Lovelace.|$|E

500|$|The {{mountain}} {{party at}} Truckee Lake began to fail. Spitzer died, then Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds), more from malnutrition than starvation.
