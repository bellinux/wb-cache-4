5|$|William of Wrotham or William de Wrotham (died c. 1217) was {{a medieval}} English royal {{administrator}} and clergyman. Although a late 13th-century source says that William held a royal office under King Henry II of England (reigned 1154–1189), the first contemporary reference to William is in 1197, {{when he became}} responsible among other <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> royal tin mines. He also held ecclesiastical office, eventually becoming Archdeacon of Taunton, and served King John of England as an administrator of ecclesiastical lands and a collector of taxes.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{needed more}} ships as war approached. The 'Ocean' design was revised and {{simplified}} to allow mass production. This new design {{was the basis}} for the Liberty ship. On December 7, 1941 Japan attacked the military bases at Hawaii, Guam, and a few days later, the Philippines. Liberty ships carried weapons, ammunition, food, tools, hardware, vehicles, and other <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war effort. They could also be equipped to carry a large number of troops by rigging bunks in the holds similar to those used by the armed guard. Liberty ships began taking troops and materials wherever they were needed, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Like other Liberty Ships, John Burke transported war materials between the United States and the rear areas of the Pacific War, often calling at Pearl Harbor, Australia, Guadalcanal, Hollandia and Manaus.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} a success, and NSB {{received}} a 112% increase in ridership the first year. This {{resulted in the}} company introducing a similar service between Trondheim and Innherred, the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, in 1993. In 1993, NSB won Statens Byggeskikkpris, among other <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new sheds on the Jæren Line. By 1995, ridership was up 150% from before the service started. In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the Jæren Commuter Rail. The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years behind schedule. In April 2004, the rail administration opened Jåttå Station, which was located close to Viking Stadion, the new home ground of Tippeligaen side Viking FK.|$|E

25|$|Kurowski's first {{publications}} {{appeared in}} the Nazi era; from 1958 until his death {{he worked as a}} freelance writer.

25|$|Depending on {{the species}} or race of mammoth, the diet {{differed}} somewhat depending on location, although all mammoths ate similar <b>things.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Columbian mammoth, M. columbi, the diet was mainly grazing. American Columbian mammoths fed primarily on cacti leaves, trees, and shrubs. These assumptions {{were based on}} mammoth feces and mammoth teeth. Mammoths, like modern day elephants, have hypsodont molars. These features also allowed mammoths to live an expansive life because {{of the availability of}} grasses and trees.|$|E

25|$|Economist Joseph Stiglitz {{argues that}} hyper-inequality may explain {{political}} questions – such as why America's infrastructure (and other public investments) are deteriorating, or the country's recent {{relative lack of}} reluctance to engage in military conflicts such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Top-earning families, wealthy enough to buy their own education, medical care, personal security, and parks, have little interest in helping pay for such <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of society, and the political influence {{to make sure they}} don't have to. So too, the lack of personal or family sacrifice involved for top earners in the military intervention of their country – their children being few and far between in the relatively low-paying all-volunteer military – may mean more willingness by influential wealthy to see its government wage war.|$|E

25|$|In M, {{characters}} are awarded Power Points (similar to experience points) {{that can do}} many beneficial <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> character. As described above, Power Points (abbreviated pp.) are used to purchase powers, feats, skills, abilities, and devices. The specific nature of Power Points was changed drastically with the 2nd edition (2e) of Mutants & Masterminds. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a Power Level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, {{as well as on}} power bonus stacking. There were options to keep the Power Level the same while increasing total number of points (and many sample antagonists in the Game Master setting have more points than their Power Level would suggest), but these have been incorporated into the 2nd edition rules.|$|E

The train transported generated a market share of one sixth of the spectators. On 2 January 2007, the Scanet train radio system was replaced with GSM-R.|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that it would be wrong to leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bank, however.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{compared}} it to Trainor's previous single, [...] "All About That Bass". [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News referred to [...] "Lips Are Movin" [...] as a catchy ladies' anthem. [...] 4Music's Jessica Lever called it [...] "another pop classic", and said, [...] "with the same sass as her debut song, we're sure this one's also going to rock the music world". Billboard said [...] "Lips Are Movin" [...] "is definitely {{in the same vein}} as 'All About That Bass,' which spells great <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> song...". Megan Friedman of Seventeen enjoyed the song's references to its predecessor, saying, [...] "when you need a pick-me-up song to help you brush off the haters, you can count on Meghan Trainor".|$|E

Alison Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the group, said of the move, [...] "It may look like Arsenal are doing great <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area, but in its detail the plan is awful. We blame the council; the football club just wants to expand to make more money." [...] Tom Lamb, an ISCA member, was concerned about as air pollution and growing traffic, adding [...] "that is a consequence which most Arsenal fans would never see, because they are in Islington only for about thirty days a year." ...|$|E

[...] Instead, he and his brother create <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One of the interesting <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> concept for this video is that {{we knew we had}} to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
