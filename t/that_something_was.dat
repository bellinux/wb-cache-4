5|$|The first {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> {{wrong at}} Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio {{contact with the}} posts, {{and drove to the}} bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|While {{relying on}} a script each week, the {{producers}} decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> untrue to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points.|$|E
5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to the dressing room.|$|E

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, at dawn, the Dutch force {{crossed the}} Lippe across a pontoon bridge. Maurice awaited them with 5,000 {{infantry}} {{and the rest}} of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel, along the opposite riverbank. Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons: the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt, the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky, the third one, those in which Nassau and his brothers marched, of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen, and the last, closing the way, of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker. Having arrived at Krudenburg, Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses. On finding a force much larger than they expected, the Dutch officers thought <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau. The Dutch commander, nevertheless, believed that it was only the convoy's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry, aiming to prevent its escape.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided {{to remain in the}} vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E

25|$|Flight 901 was {{supposed}} to arrive back at Christchurch at 6:05pm for a stopover including refuelling and a crew change before completing the journey back to Auckland. Around 50 passengers were also supposed to disembark at Christchurch. Airport staff initially told the waiting families that it was usual for the flight to be slightly late but, as time went on, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong.|$|E
25|$|The giant hand on {{the cover}} was an afterthought; when the {{painting}} lacked the hand, Heppner loved the new cover but felt only <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> missing. He randomly suggested a hand, and Roper responded by taking {{a picture of his}} own hand and superimposing it on the image, emailing the group the result two hours later. He did not paint the hand; he merely inserted it with a software program.|$|E
25|$|The Estonian {{authorities}} {{refused to}} send the flight data recorder of the helicopter to the United States because the aircraft was manufactured there, thus possibly creating a conflict of interest.

25|$|On 4 September 1815 Quesnel was {{retired from}} the army. In April 1819, he {{suddenly}} disappeared and his corpse was found floating in the Seine in Paris. His watch and a valuable piece of jewelry were found on his body. One source asserted that his death {{could not have been}} a suicide because he was held in high regard in military circles and gave no hint that morning <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong. It was suggested that certain individuals threw him off the Pont des Arts (bridge) for political reasons. QUESNEL is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on the west panel.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously {{the colonists}} sent Ephraim Curtis {{to the west}} of Boston into Nipmuc {{territory}} to negotiate with the tribe and obtain assurances of loyalty to the English from them. However, Curtis' expedition party found only empty Nipmuc villages which signified <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> already afoot. Eventually, Curtis managed to find the whereabouts of the Nipmuc chief sachem, Muttawmp, and agreed to a meeting at a pre-arranged spot. However, unbeknownst to Curtis {{it was too late for}} negotiations, as the Nipmucs, under sachem Matoonas, had already attacked an English settlement at Mendon and had decided to join Metacom's rebellion. Curtis was later joined by Captain Thomas Wheeler and Captain Edward Hutchinson (son of Anne Hutchinson).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Qiu and {{the other}} eunuchs were at the Left Jinwu headquarters. Han, however, had become fearful and was nervous and sweating.

Qiu {{and the other}} eunuchs were surprised and quickly ran outside. The guards at the Left Jinwu headquarters were about to close the gate to close them in, but Qiu yelled at them, and they, surprised, were unable to close the gates. Qiu and the other eunuchs ran back to Hanyuan Hall, preparing to report to Wenzong what was happening.|$|E

25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, {{in an analysis}} of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E
25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was {{the roar of the}} strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> going on.|$|E

25|$|During this event, the {{observed}} magnitude was predicted to increase from 14.7 (star + Chariklo) to 18.5 (Chariklo alone) for at most 19.2 seconds. This increase of 3.8 magnitudes {{is equivalent to}} a decrease in brightness by a factor 32.5. The primary occultation event was accompanied by four additional small decreases in the overall intensity of the light curve, which were observed seven seconds before ingress and seven seconds after egress. These secondary occultations indicated <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> partially blocking the light of UCAC4 248-108672. The symmetry of the secondary occultations and multiple observations of the event in various locations helped reconstruct not only the shape {{and size of the}} object, but also the thickness, orientation, and location of the ring planes. The relatively consistent ring properties inferred from several secondary occultation observations discredit alternative explanations for these features, such as cometary-like outgassing.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong and decided to head to the bridge. However, when he got to the door of his cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window. The rising water column carried the chief officer upwards in the staircase until, only seconds from drowning, he arrived at the corridor next to the ship's sauna, which was below the main deck and thus above the surface.|$|E
25|$|John begins seeing Dr. Charlotte Taylor {{to regain}} his memories.

When Brady returns to town, he helps Marlena discover that John is remembering, but Charlotte is actually keeping him in the dark. Charlotte comes to Marlena's apartment and tries to kill her, and explains that she is jealous of her because of how her father seemed to favor Marlena over Charlotte. However, John bursts in at the last minute, and ends up getting attacked by Charlotte. Charlotte is arrested while John is rushed to the hospital. He wakes up with his memory restored. Marlena finds out that John is paralyzed, but he can be treated at a clinic in Switzerland. John and Marlena reunite, get remarried, and head off to Switzerland to treat John's paralysis on January 23, 2009.|$|E
