It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8/10, observing that while he was in the minority of reviewers for not [...] "absolutely loving it", he found [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] to be [...] "a bit messy in the writing department, even while it delivered several really great scenes and moments along the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> about managing people is that we can influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is about. When I can do that, I am very happy".|$|E

However, Chan was praised for his decision to play a darker character in Rob-B-Hood. Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post stated that [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>things</b> Chan can do for his flagging movie career is to play a heavy—a nasty, scum-of-the-earth antagonist, since you do not always have to play a hero to be a hero." [...] Sun emphasised the need for Chan to show flexibility in his roles, citing a number of actors that have thrived by playing the occasional villain.|$|E
