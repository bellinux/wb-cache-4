5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from <b>the</b> <b>different</b> sites. They found <b>the</b> <b>different</b> orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to <b>the</b> <b>different</b> types of bonding exhibited by <b>the</b> <b>different</b> lanthanides, {{it is possible to}} isolate the compounds.|$|E
