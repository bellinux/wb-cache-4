5|$|The Itchen Navigation {{supports}} a rich flora and fauna, and one {{benefit of the}} 5-year grant-funded restoration project has been the regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document <b>this.</b> <b>Annual</b> reports on the populations of birds, bats, otters, water voles and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies have been produced, with occasional reports on other aspects, while the Environment Agency has produces fisheries reports. As part of the project, a number of engineering works {{have been carried out}} to stabilise the banks, and trees have been cut back {{to reduce the amount of}} shade and encourage the growth of marginal vegetation. In the case of the water vole survey, this has been concentrated on the sections where work has been carried out, whereas the butterfly, damselfly and dragonfly survey has tended to cover the whole navigation. Vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along the banks. The project has tried to avoid the installation of revetments, as the vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing the banks, but where a revetment is necessary to combat erosion, it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften the edge.|$|E
5|$|The annual Thanksgiving holiday is {{a fairly}} recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. {{government}} had declared a particular day as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly {{after the end of}} the War of 1812. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Boston's Ladies' Magazine, wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of <b>this</b> <b>annual</b> day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim's first harvest feast. After nearly 40 years, Abraham Lincoln declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Congress ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some sparring as to the date, the holiday was recognized by Congress as an official federal holiday in 1941.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>annual</b> pilgrimage, {{called the}} Rosh Hashana kibbutz, drew {{thousands}} of Hasidim {{from all over}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and even Poland until 1917, when the Bolshevik Revolution forced it to continue clandestinely. Only {{a dozen or so}} Hasidim risked making the annual pilgrimage during the Communist era, as the authorities regularly raided the gathering and often arrested and imprisoned worshippers. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Hasidim who lived outside Russia began to sneak into Uman to pray at Rebbe Nachman's grave during the year. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the gates were reopened entirely. In 2008, approximately 25,000 {{people from all over the}} world participated in <b>this</b> <b>annual</b> pilgrimage.|$|E
