[...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded it 3½ out of 4 stars and added, [...] "Sweeney Todd is a thriller-diller from start to finish: scary, monstrously funny and melodically thrilling... is a bloody wonder, {{intimate}} and epic, horrific and heart-rending as it flies on the wings of Sondheim's most thunderously exciting score." [...] As with Time, the critic ranked it fifth on his list of the best movies of 2007. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The blood juxtaposed to the music is highly unsettling. It runs contrary to expectations. Burton pushes this gore into his audiences' faces so as to feel the madness and the destructive fury of Sweeney's obsession. Teaming with Depp, his long-time alter ego, Burton makes Sweeney a smoldering dark pit of fury and hate that consumes itself. With his sturdy acting and surprisingly good voice, Depp is a Sweeney Todd for the ages." [...] Harry Knowles gave the film a highly positive review, calling it Burton's best film since Ed Wood, his favorite Burton film, and said it was possibly superior. He praised all of the cast and the cinematography, but noted it would probably not appeal to non-musical fans due to the dominance of music in the film.|$|E
