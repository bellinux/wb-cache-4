25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> how that would have an effect on his character [...] to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{made his}} test debut against England in 1975. [...] "No one said much <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> my first Test," [...] he recalled. [...] "You were an Australian, you'd got there {{because you could}} play, and you were {{expected}} to man up." ...|$|E
60|$|When it was over, Harun {{commanded}} my wife <b>to</b> lead <b>me</b> <b>before</b> him.|$|R
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You {{made that}} promise <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once <b>before</b> and broke it.|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [holding her]. Nobody {{asked you}} to, ma'am. I never asked any woman <b>to</b> marry <b>me</b> <b>before.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{got down}} on my knees and I did say 'thank you' to God. And right then and there joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before,</b> became everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "She was a born {{business}} {{woman with}} an outstanding gift for organisation. [...] No financial statement was too intricate for her, and no contract too abstruse. Once, when I had to put one of her letters <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> my legal adviser... he declared firmly 'this letter must {{have been written by}} a solicitor.' He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications. [...] Mrs. Carte, besides her natural business talent, had fine artistic taste and was a sound judge, too, of the capabilities of those who came to the theatre in search of engagements".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her life, Bet {{exhibited}} a strong spirit {{and sense of}} self. She came into conflict with Hannah Ashley, {{who was raised in}} the strict Dutch culture of the New York colony. In 1780, Bet prevented Hannah from striking a servant girl with a heated shovel; Elizabeth shielded the girl and received a deep wound in her arm. As the wound healed, Bet left it uncovered as evidence of her harsh treatment. Catharine Maria Sedgwick quotes Elizabeth saying, [...] "Madam never again laid her hand on Lizzy [...] 'I had a bad arm all winter, but Madam had the worst of it. I never covered the wound, and when people said <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>before</b> Madam, [...] "Betty, what ails your arm?" [...] I only answered - 'ask missis!' Which was the slave and which was the real misses?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, having {{finished}} my thought, I rose, and, {{going to the}} kraal of my friend, I doctored my burnt hand, that pained me, and as I was doctoring it there came a messenger <b>to</b> <b>me</b> summoning <b>me</b> <b>before</b> the king.|$|R
60|$|She left me, and I {{lay in bed}} content: it {{was good}} of Graham <b>to</b> {{remember}} <b>me</b> <b>before</b> he went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{says that}} she ran along the bank and got into my {{house-boat}} by the plank, meaning <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>before</b> her father arrived and <b>to</b> entreat <b>me</b> <b>to</b> run away." ...|$|R
2500|$|She later {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement. She went on to say following the incident, [...] "what really hurt was that he was not sensitive to me as a woman and his attempt at reconciliation had come too late" [...] suggesting that his actions were a deliberate attempt at reconciliation or compensation for his lack of sexual interest in Priscilla which had been a source of hurt and discontent for her for years. Priscilla states in her book [...] "He had mentioned <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> we were married that he {{had never been able to}} make love to a woman who had a child" [...] and she later expressed the personal repercussions of their sexual dysfunction [...] "I am beginning to doubt my own sexuality as a woman. My physical and emotional needs were unfulfilled." [...] After this incident, Priscilla summarized [...] "this was not the gentle, understanding man I grew to love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pierpont {{writes that}} John Garfield was first {{choice for the}} role, but [...] "made {{impossible}} demands." [...] It was Kazan's decision {{to fall back on}} the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: [...] "It had not occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard." [...] Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, [...] "The curtain went up and on the stage is {{that son of a bitch}} from the gym, and he's playing me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s Maykov contributed {{mainly to}} Russky Vestnik. One {{of the leading}} proponents of Russian Panslavism, he saw his country as {{fulfilling}} its mission in uniting Slavs, but first and foremost freeing {{the peoples of the}} Balkans from Turkish occupation. [...] "Once you've seen Russia in this [...] perspective, you start to understand its true nature and feel ready to devote yourself to this life-affirming cause," [...] wrote Maykov in a letter to Dostoyevsky. The mission of art, according to the poet, was to develop the national self-consciousness and revive the 'historical memory' of Russians. The Slavic historic and moral basis on which it stood became the major theme of Maykov's poetry cycles [...] "Of the Slavic World", [...] "At Home", and [...] "Callings of History". Well aware of the darker side of Russia's historic legacy, he still thought it necessary to highlight its 'shining moments' ("It's dear <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>before</b> the icon...", 1868). Maykov was not a religious person himself but attributed great importance to the religious fervor of the common people, seeing it as the basis for 'moral wholesomeness' ("The spring, like an artist", 1859; [...] "Ignored by all...", 1872). His religious poems of the late 1880s ("Let go, let go...", [...] "The sunsetâ€™s quiet shine...", [...] "Eternal night is near...") differed radically from his earlier odes to paganism. In them Maykov professed a belief in spiritual humility and expressed the conviction that this particular feature of the Russian national character would be its saving grace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. But {{you said}} {{when we were}} getting up this morning that you had {{something}} you wished <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>before</b> I left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--I didn't {{think about}} how I was altered!' said the conscience-stricken girl. 'I used to kiss him, and he used <b>to</b> kiss <b>me</b> <b>before</b> he went away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However little it may be, Sir Marmaduke," [...] said Lambert firmly, {{speaking}} {{directly to}} his employer, [...] "I humbly pray you <b>to</b> excuse <b>me</b> <b>before</b> these gentlemen ..." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{certainly}} {{had not occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before,</b> but I said, Yes, I should like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No you don't,' he says, {{reaching}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>me.</b> 'The cooking has got on your head. You listen <b>to</b> <b>me</b> talk <b>before</b> {{you up and}} do anything brash.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{remembered what}} old Zikali had said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> years <b>before</b> <b>to</b> {{the effect that}} Saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Hampton, {{what have}} you been doing, and why have you not been <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> <b>before?</b> I heard you were in town--at least, I heard so ten days ago.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE. A bachelor! And you {{are sure}} you never spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before?</b> Do think.|$|E
60|$|Those {{were the}} last words he said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> he {{squeezed}} his huge body into the cab and drove off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wegg and Thompson had {{transferred}} {{their entire}} stock <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> one {{died and the}} other went mad," [...] was the quiet reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "No? Then {{what else}} will your worship give {{me on the}} day of the fiesta?" [...] she asked, angrily; [...] "so as not <b>to</b> shame <b>me</b> <b>before</b> all these people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{spoke of}} me as the assassin of Lagron. I do not affect to {{misunderstand}} you. You expounded your views <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once <b>before,</b> and I remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{right of}} prior claim," [...] said the other. [...] "This {{woodland}} belonged <b>to</b> <b>me</b> long <b>before</b> {{one of your}} white-faced race put foot upon the soil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah--h!' he said almost with disgust, 'don't talk {{of slavery}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before</b> my time. How I hate it, and {{everything}} else! Good night!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{officer of}} the law gave the case his closest attention, and asked me even more {{questions}} than had been put <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
60|$|The whole inexplicable tangle {{seemed to}} {{straighten}} out before me. I wondered, as I always did, how {{it had not been}} obvious <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
