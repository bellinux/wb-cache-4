2500|$|Rather than {{building}} a second brewery and potentially putting {{the company at}} risk, Pearl decided to purchase an existing brewery to increase production and the distribution network.

[...] From a short list of potentials, the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, seemed the perfect fit for Pearl’s plans. [...] Goetz’s historic brewery would allow increased production levels and the ability to use the well-established distribution network to help Pearl reach untapped markets.

The formation of clusters separating the variet-ies with higher malting quality from the others with lower quality suggests that there is a relationship between the general hordein polypeptide pattern and malting quality in the varieties analysed. By the Sperman’s correlation test three hordein bands correlated negatively with malting quality in the germplasm studied. Index terms: Hordeum vulgare, storage proteins, electrophoresis.

5000|$|The {{oldest and}} most {{predominant}} ingredient in brewing is barley, which {{has been used in}} beer-making for thousands of years. Modern brewing predominantly uses malted barley for its enzymatic power, but ancient Babylonian recipes indicate that, without the ability <b>to</b> <b>malt</b> grain in a controlled fashion, baked bread was simply soaked in water [...]Malted barley dried at a sufficiently low temperature contains enzymes such as amylase, which convert starch into sugar. Therefore, sugars can be extracted from the barley's own starches simply by soaking the grain in water at a controlled temperature; this is mashing.|$|E
50|$|On 8 June 2012, Professor of Psychiatry Ulrik Fredrik Malt {{testified in}} court {{as an expert}} witness, saying he found it {{unlikely}} that Breivik had schizophrenia. According <b>to</b> <b>Malt,</b> Breivik primarily suffered from Asperger syndrome, Tourette syndrome, narcissistic personality disorder and possibly paranoid psychosis. Malt cited {{a number of factors}} in support of his diagnoses, including deviant behaviour as a child, extreme specialization in Breivik's study of weapons and bomb technology, strange facial expression, a remarkable way of talking, and an obsession with numbers. Eirik Johannesen disagreed, concluding that Breivik was lying and was not delusional or psychotic. Johannesen had observed and spoken to Breivik for more than 20 hours.|$|E

The peat is then mixed with heather before being used as fuel. The malt is peated to a level of 20 parts per million phenol and then mixed with unpeated malt produced on the Scottish mainland.|$|E

The emergence of Zima as the new malternative marked the end of White Mountain. Miller and Anheuser Busch exited the wine cooler market. California Cooler and Sun Country ceased production.

5000|$|In 1865 {{it created}} a {{commission}} to travel to Europe to [...] "obtain full and accurate information of the Excise Laws of Europe appertaining <b>to</b> <b>malt</b> liquors"; {{the findings of the}} commission enabled the brewers to help determine U.S. taxation policy by showing that low rates of taxation encouraged consumption and brought in more revenue. The USBA got along well with top officials of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, who often attended its conventions, and saw its relationship with the government as one of reciprocal duties and obligations. The approach was effective; between 1864 and 1898 the tax on malt beverages remained constant while that on distilled liquors was raised three times.|$|E
50|$|The malEp and malKp {{promoters}} are synergistically {{activated by}} protein MalT, the activator of the Mal regulon {{and by the}} cAMP receptor protein CRP. This activation is a coupled process that involves, going from malEp towards malKp: two MalT binding sites; three CRP binding site, and two overlapping sets of three MalT binding sites, staggered by three base pairs. Transcription activation requires the binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and maltotriose <b>to</b> <b>MalT</b> and the binding of cyclic AMP to the dimer of CRP. The unliganded form of MalT is monomeric whereas its liganded form, {{in the presence of}} ATP and maltotriose, is oligomeric. One suspects that commercial maltose contains enough maltotriose for the induction of the Mal regulon.|$|E

40|$|Mapping QTLs {{responsible}} for malting quality traits in barley populations {{has been the}} main genetic approach <b>to</b> <b>malting</b> quality breeding. A ‘winter x spring’ doubled haploid barley population ‘Nure’ x ‘Tremois’, where such traits were segregating, has been recently developed. Our objective was to map QTLs for malting quality from two years of trials in two contrasting locations. QTLs were found on six chromosomes, with a main cluster on chromosome 1 H. For wort viscosity and malt extract, favourable alleles at two loci on chromosome 5 H were carried by the winter feeding parent ‘Nure’. Doubled-haploids with higher quality than the spring malting cultivar ‘Tremois’ showed either a facultative or a winter growth habit and a level of frost tolerance {{comparable to that of}} the winter tolerant parent ‘Nure’. Markers and QTLs of quality traits were further validated on a separate set of DH lines, coming from the same cross, by means of marker-assisted selection. This showed that, at least in the present cross combination, positive contributions <b>to</b> <b>malting</b> quality can be found in winter feed barley...|$|R
