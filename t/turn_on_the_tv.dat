You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{problems}} exist {{with regard}} to on-screen displays. One of them is diagnostics if a television's display system is damaged.
