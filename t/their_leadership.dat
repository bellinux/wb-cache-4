5|$|Pablo and Mandel {{aimed to}} counter the {{opposition}} of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary Communist Party and French Internationalist Communist Party. Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out <b>their</b> <b>leaderships.</b> They supported Gerry Healy's opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including Pierre Frank and Marcel Bleibtreu, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.|$|R
40|$|In history, {{there are}} many {{examples}} where well-managed companies struggled to maintain <b>their</b> <b>leaderships</b> when disruptive technology emerged. For example, emergence of digital technology destroyed the market of film based camera which affected the leadership of Kodak, {{who had been the}} market leader of film-based camera market for more than 100 years. The same trend has been remarked across many other industries. For example, IBM dominated the mainframe computer market for years, but emergence of minicomputer, which was technologically simpler than mainframes, redefined the computer market and IBM lost its dominance in computer market. There are many other cases of leadership failures due to disruptive innovations. However, there are few examples where well-managed companies maintained <b>their</b> <b>leaderships</b> during the emergence of disruptive innovation by effectively managing their business models. This dissertation outlines such business model for vendors in business intelligence industry. Moreover, the dissertation also highlights the concepts and theories associated with disruptive innovation and business model. The nature of this research and its corresponding research question and objectives involves an analysis from theoretical background to actual practice. The main motive behind this research is to identify the previous disruptive innovation trends and identify the business models of the vendors who maintained its leaderships. In order to achieve this, secondary research is conducted. The research is primarily descriptive. On the basis of findings, recommendations are made in the end of this dissertation to advice other leaders of business intelligence industry about the effective business model they can follow to maintain <b>their</b> <b>leaderships</b> when disruptive innovation emerge...|$|R

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|Račić {{signed a}} mutual {{cooperation}} agreement against the occupation {{forces with the}} commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Nebojša Jerković. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment became quite isolated. <b>Their</b> <b>leadership</b> realised that the Partisans were getting stronger with each success against the occupiers, and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their inaction. Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Račić signed with the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This {{was different from the}} other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the revolt}} was to inspire a wider {{uprising}} among the general populace {{in an attempt to}} overthrow the colonial regime and establish independence. The VNQDĐ had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing French scrutiny on their activities led to <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nazis won the {{greatest}} {{share of the}} popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority and therefore Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung ("seizure of power"). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ("co-ordination") to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations and sports clubs, had <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.|$|E

However he was also a political militant within the UVF, and soon he publicly disagreed with <b>their</b> <b>leadership's</b> calling of the ceasefire, being sceptical of the IRA's motives for supporting the Northern Ireland peace process.|$|R
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under the wing of the CIA effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were more aggressive than the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to <b>their</b> <b>leadership</b> in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated in the training and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{that women in}} science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields are underrepresented in leadership globally. However, {{little is known about}} how leadership styles of women in STEMM relate to this underrepresentation. This article discusses findings from a survey examining how 61 women in STEMM define <b>leadership</b> and describe <b>their</b> own <b>leadership</b> styles. Using content analysis and drawing on Full Range Leadership Model factors, findings suggest that women define <b>leadership</b> and describe <b>their</b> own <b>leadership</b> styles using transformational factors. However, there was no consistency in how participants defined ideal leadership or how they defined <b>their</b> own <b>leadership</b> styles. This finding unsettles ideas of distinctly gendered leadership styles. We argue that expectations that leadership will be performed in distinctly gendered styles may be contributing to the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles in STEMM...|$|R
