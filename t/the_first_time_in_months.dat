500|$|In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU {{sued the}} City of Los Angeles, {{on behalf of}} Robert Lee Purrie and five other {{homeless}} people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting due process and equal protection, and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment). The Court {{ruled in favor of}} the ACLU, stating that, [...] "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." [...] Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is [...] "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 6:30am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not [...] "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" [...] and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A female Native {{informant}} who was of {{the tribe}} foiled the plans of hostile Senecas to burn Le Griffon as she grew on her stocks. [...] The unrest of the Seneca and dissatisfied workmen were continually incited by secret agents of merchants and traders who feared La Salle would break their monopoly on the fur trade. When the Seneca again threatened to burn the ship, she was launched earlier than planned in Cayuga Creek channel of the upper Niagara River with ceremony and the roar of her cannons. [...] A party from the Iroquois tribe who witnessed the launching were so impressed by the [...] "large floating fort" [...] that they named the French builders Ot-kon, meaning [...] "penetrating minds", which corresponds to the Seneca word Ot-goh, meaning supernatural beings or spirits. [...] The tumultuous sound of Le Griffon's cannons so amazed the Native Americans that the Frenchmen were able to sleep at ease for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months</b> when they anchored off shore.|$|E

5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144.

Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 873), Büchel (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1202), Broich (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1442).|$|R

50|$|The 1961 Hawthorn Football Club {{season was}} the clubs 37th {{season in the}} Victorian Football League.

60|$|We did, {{running the}} boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump ashore. Two of the other dogs, good dogs, {{followed}} him; and we lost two whole days trying to find them. We never saw those two dogs again; but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused his hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months</b> Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang. We were as happy as clams. The dark days were over. The nightmare had been lifted. That Spot was gone.|$|E
6000|$|This noble {{invitation}} translated {{me from my}} dark, cold, cramped den (with its night-guard of redoubtable cockroaches) {{into the}} light and air of a comfortable suburban home. It took {{me back to the}} sky and the birds and the grass--and Irish Mary, the cook, put red blood into my veins. In my sabbath walks along the beautiful country roads, I heard again the song of the cat-bird and the trill of the bobolink. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months</b> I slept in freedom from hunger, in security of the morrow. Oh, good Hiram Cross, your golden crown should be studded with jewels, for your life was filled with kindnesses like this! ...|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba.

Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R

60|$|I {{had never}} quite {{overcome}} my childish dread of the dark, {{and as we}} stepped from the train to the wayside platform I shall never forget the sickening wave of loneliness that deluged my courage. A longing for the electric lights of the city, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months,</b> fastened upon me; while never before had a familiar voice sounded so welcome as did Sidney's, coming from the uncanny denseness of the night. It was not until we had reached the long dark tunnel of peppers that I regained the composure which I felt continually from my first day with the Doña Maria.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "women are {{too many}} for me. If there's any way of {{pleasing}} 'em I haven't yet discovered it. The night before last {{you had to have}} the house. Nothing else would do. It was the greatest find in New York. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>months</b> you get up for breakfast--a pretty sure sign you hadn't changed your mind. You drag me to see it, and when you land me there, because I don't lose my head immediately, you say you don't want it. Of course I didn't take you seriously--I thought you'd set your heart on it, so I wired an offer to Shorter to-day, and he accepted it. And when I hand you this pleasant little surprise, you go right up in the air." ...|$|E
