5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} legend {{associated}} with Marathon {{is that of}} <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> Pheidippides (or Philippides) bringing news to Athens of the battle, which is described below.|$|E
5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5000|$|Papa hōlua are {{composed}} {{of a pair of}} runners and a superstructure (platform). <b>The</b> <b>runners</b> are made from hard native woods, traditionally that of kauila (Alphitonia ponderosa or Colubrina oppositifolia), uhiuhi (Caesalpinia kavaiensis), or māmane (Sophora chrysophylla). [...] <b>The</b> <b>runners</b> have up-curved fore edges, straight aft edges, and rounded lower edges. Crosspieces keep <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> apart. <b>The</b> superstructure, two rails smaller in diameter than <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> and spaced apart by pieces of bamboo, sits on top of <b>the</b> crosspieces. <b>The</b> <b>runners,</b> crosspieces, and rails are bound together with sennit cordage. The rails are wrapped in white kapa cloth and the rail frame is covered in lauhala matting. Oil from kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts coats either the course or <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> to provide lubrication.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the game has two teams of three or more people. One team are hunters and <b>the</b> other are <b>runners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>runners</b> are given time to hide within the boundaries. The hunters (also known as [...] "raptors") try to find <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> and tag them. Once <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> are tagged they are out and must {{go back to the}} base (a.k.a. [...] "hospital"). In this game you must get the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> (2 out of 3, 3 out of 4, 4 out of 6 etc.). If majority is captured the sides change with <b>the</b> hunters becoming <b>runners</b> and <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> hunters. If majority is not captured, the sides remain the same until a majority is captured.|$|R

5|$|Zeno's paradoxes, {{particularly}} {{the paradox of}} <b>the</b> <b>runner,</b> are reminiscent of the apparent paradox that 0.999... and 1 are equal. <b>The</b> <b>runner</b> paradox can be mathematically modelled and then, like 0.999..., resolved using a geometric series. However, {{it is not clear}} if this mathematical treatment addresses the underlying metaphysical issues Zeno was exploring.|$|E
5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to reach safely. If a wild throw allows <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|The tag out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who is touched by a fielder {{with the ball}} or a glove holding the ball, while <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> is not touching a base.|$|E
50|$|Conditions {{races are}} horse races {{in which the}} weights carried by <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> are laid down by the {{conditions}} attached to the race. Weights are allocated according to the sex of <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> with female runners carrying less weight than males; the age of <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> with younger horses receiving weight from older runners to allow for relative maturity, referred to as weight for age; {{and the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> with horses that have won certain values of races giving weight to less successful entrants.|$|R

5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled <b>The</b> <b>Runner,</b> this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
50|$|Since 1999, {{the course}} route has been shorter than standard. During the 2004 race, <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> went off-course; reports {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> may have covered an additional 5 km.|$|R

5|$|Getty {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} Canadian-born quarterbacks in the history of the Canadian Football League and sits at third on the all-time passing yardage list of Canadian quarterbacks, behind Russ Jackson and Gerry Dattilio, with nearly nine thousand yards. He was declared the outstanding Canadian player in the Western Interprovincial Football Union in 1959, and was <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> up (to Jackson) for the Schenley Award as the league's most outstanding Canadian player the same year. He was placed on the Eskimos' Wall of Honor in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|The tournaments {{were not}} without controversy. Players complained about Microsoft's {{tardiness}} in posting the official {{rules for the}} first playoff, and {{it was believed that}} the top posted score was not achievable by fair means. Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, and allowed the results to stand. In the second playoff, Microsoft initially named <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E
50|$|For <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> an infield fly {{is little}} {{different}} from an ordinary fly ball. If an infield fly is caught, <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> must retouch their original bases ("tag up") after the catch before attempting to advance. If an infield fly is not caught, no tag up is required and <b>the</b> <b>runners</b> may advance at their own risk. The {{only difference is that}} the umpire's declaration that the batter is out removes force plays and gives <b>runners</b> <b>the</b> option of staying on the base.|$|R
50|$|Along {{the route}} are over 40 high school cheerleading teams and 70 bands who perform for <b>the</b> <b>runners.</b> Later in <b>the</b> evening {{there is a}} concert held in Tempe for all <b>the</b> <b>runners,</b> volunteers and spectators.|$|R

5|$|Henry {{was educated}} at George Watson's Boys' College and Blair Lodge before he {{enrolled}} on the training ship HMS Britannia {{at the age}} of fourteen, in 1890. Rapidly rising in the navy due to keen intelligence and impressive strength, Ritchie was promoted to lieutenant six years later, and served for the next fifteen years as a junior staff officer at Sheerness Gunnery School. In 1900 Ritchie became the armed forces lightweight boxing champion, and was <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> up in the same contest the following year. In July 1902 he was posted to the battleship HMS Sans Pareil, docked in the Medway as part of the Reserve squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} prize {{pool was}} $2.13 million contributed by Riot Games, {{with the final}} amount being calculated after fan contributions stopped on November 6. Riot pledged to add 25% of all revenue generated from selling Championship wards and skins – customizations for the player controlled hero character – to the prize pool. On October 28, the sale of these unique Championship skins had grown the prize pool to $5.07 million, making it the largest single prize pool in League of Legends history. The final prize pool reached $6.7 million. Riot announced that 40% of the prize pool will be awarded to the winning team and 15% to <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> up. The winning team would also receive 25% of revenue from skins created to commemorate the championship victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the {{majority}} of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> from first arrives to force that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Relay races {{emerged in}} the United States in the 1880s as a {{variation}} on charity races between firemen, who would hand a red pennant on to teammates every 300yards. There are two very common relay events: the 4×100 metres relay and the 4×400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one-off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 × 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 × 400 m event remain in their own lane until <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner-most part of the circuit. For {{the second and third}} baton change overs, teammates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while teammates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{were one}} game shy {{of winning the}} first-half pennant in 1984. Winning the first-half title is {{something}} that eluded the team during its entire seven-year span in the Southern League. One important highlight {{of the first half}} of 1984 took place on May 4, when Jim Deshaies pitched the club's first no-hitter against the Columbus Astros in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader. The 5–1 Sounds victory was cut short of being a perfect game following three walks and a batter being hit by a pitch, advancing <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> home for the only Astros run of the game. Nashville went on to capture the second-half title, however, for the sixth consecutive season, after defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays in a playoff game. The two teams met again in the divisional playoffs, but the Blue Jays emerged the victor, eliminating the Sounds from the playoffs. Skipper Jim Marshall led his Sounds to a 74–73 record.|$|E
5|$|Sayed Abdelmoneim, {{competing}} in the 60 kg class, and Abdelrahman El-Trabely, {{competing in}} the 120 kg class, both lost {{in the first round}} against one of the eventual finalists and were defeated a second time in the repechage. Abdelmoneim had been the 2010 African champion and had qualified for the Olympics by winning the African and Oceania qualification tournament. In London he lost to Georgia's Revaz Lashkhi and Russia's Zaur Kuramagomedov, eventual silver and bronze medalists respectively. El-Trabely was the 2011 African runner-up and was second in the African and Oceania qualification tournament behind Tunisia's Radhouane Chebbi. At the Games he lost against 2008 and 2012 Olympic champion Mijaín López of Cuba and Guram Pherselidze of Georgia. Mohamed Abouhalima, Islam Tolba, and Mohamed Abdelfatah all lost their opening bouts and were eliminated without appearing in the repechage. Abouhalima, {{competing in the}} 55kg class, was the 2011 junior and 2012 senior African champion and won the African and Oceania qualifying tournament. Tolba, competing in the 74 kg class, was <b>the</b> <b>runner</b> up at the 2011 African Championships, 2011 Pan Arab Games, and the African and Oceania qualifying tournament, behind Tunisia's Zied Ayet Ikram of Tunisia all three times. Abdelfatah had accrued numerous international honors since winning the 83kg class at the 1997 Pan Arab Games and was a veteran of the 85 kg class at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 84 kg class at the 2004 edition. In London he competed in the 96 kg class and qualified by coming in fifth at the 2011 World Championships.|$|E
