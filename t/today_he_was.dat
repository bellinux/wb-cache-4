5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ <b>today),</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> known as a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two}} years before he could be sent to the minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E

5|$|After his MVP season, Killebrew {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ <b>today).</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew {{was one of only}} four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's Brooks Robinson rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through {{the second half of the}} year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate Tony Oliva and Baltimore's Boog Powell, who won the award. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, a rematch of the previous season. The Twins were again swept, though Killebrew's performance improved as he hit two home runs in three games.|$|E

5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually {{came to a stop}} and the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ <b>today).</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> involved in the development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E

Godfrey (also dying from his wounds) retired to a crannóg in Lough Beag (Gartan Lake). O'Neill of Tyrone – taking advantage of Godfrey's fatal illness – demanded submission, hostages and pledges from the Cenél Conaill since they had no strong chieftain since the wounding of Godfrey.
