5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> 13th-century, while the dividing wall including <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> 18th-century.|$|E
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> an oculus window that originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills. The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor windows are modern but within the original openings.|$|E
5|$|The goal in each cavern is {{to locate}} both {{the end of}} level door and the special pillar which unlocks it. When stepped on, the pillar {{activates}} a countdown timer, during which <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. Once the timer is active, the player must get to the door before the timer ends and the door re-closes. There are multiple bonus games in between levels where the player can amass more treasure. Later levels include caveman villages where the player can purchase new tools with collected treasure as a currency.|$|E
50|$|Thomas G. Doty {{arrived at}} the gate after <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> had <b>been</b> closed. Although airline policy <b>is</b> that once <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> closed they are not to <b>be</b> reopened, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> reopened and Doty was allowed to board.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> {{extremely}} heavy, {{and when}} opening them great care {{had to be}} taken that the latch engaged the top of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> spring-loaded and if the springs <b>were</b> strong <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> would close immediately. On the inside, the driver and passenger both had door release pads located above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> openings. All one had to do to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> hit <b>the</b> pad and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> would slam shut.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's up?" [...] asked {{somebody}} outside, {{and then}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> tried. Soon a key was inserted in <b>the</b> lock, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> opened, and a chambermaid showed herself.|$|R
5|$|The roof is tiled and hipped, {{with five}} hips in all. The seven window {{openings}} {{built into the}} roof at second-floor level are original, but fitted with modern windows. On the first floor there are nine tall, narrow windows with wide frames, stone sills and deep arches of rubbed brick. In the late 18th century, eight windows were altered, {{two of which are}} on the left-hand-side of the door. The door itself is placed centrally with a coved, moulded architrave above and 45-degree corbels decorated with acanthus supporting a cornice with round brackets and a carved keystone. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> glazed and a Doric porch of modern brick covers the doorcase.|$|E
5|$|Two huge granite lions, {{taken from}} the gardens of the Mellon Mansion, stand guard at the main {{entrance}} {{of the school and}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> surmounted with a terracotta Madonna by Della Robbia. In the school, there are nine classrooms, two auditoriums, a library, a cafeteria, and a utility kitchen. When the school was completed in 1960, it opened for children in grades 1â€“8. Later on, a kindergarten and preschool were added.|$|E
5|$|While Parvati {{settles into}} her new house, Devadasu chooses {{the path of}} self-destruction. On the advice of Chandramukhi, he leaves for his village, but goes to Durgapuram to keep a promise he had made to Parvati that he visit her before his death. Devadasu {{breathes}} his last {{in front of her}} house. Parvati rushes to see him, but <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed by her family and she collapses.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} eleven o'clock, and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> closed behind them.|$|R
50|$|According {{to another}} legend, the azhwar saint Thirumangai Azhwar visited the temple and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> locked at <b>the</b> time. He was singing praise of Parimala Ranganathar, but <b>the</b> <b>door</b> still <b>was</b> not open. After {{continuous}} singing, he became frustrated {{at one point}} and so asked Parimala Ranganathar to keep the temple for himself, when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were up}} at their {{accustomed}} hour and arrived at the works at Limehouse before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened. Presently some men and boys arrived, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened, and <b>the</b> two boys followed the others in.|$|R
5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and {{they are asked to}} play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke like each other and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E
6000|$|Deane {{was across}} the landing in a moment. He tapped sharply upon <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> There <b>was</b> no answer. He tried <b>the</b> handle. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> locked! ...|$|R

5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a fascination for the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> an old lift that takes them down to another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.|$|E
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glassesâ€”the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{space for}} a seventh statue, but where it should have stood was a great arched <b>door</b> of adamant. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> tightly shut, and there was neither lock nor key to it.

50|$|Inge {{carried out}} {{extensive}} repairs to the episcopal palace of St. Sepulchre; {{his name is}} commemorated in Hugh Inge's <b>door,</b> which <b>was</b> restored in the eighteenth century; a few fragments of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>were</b> discovered during excavations some years ago, at present-day Kevin Street. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> described as having an unusual three-centred head.|$|R
5|$|The theatre, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered {{a prime example of}} Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'Å“il ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E
