5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ceasefire {{for as long}} as he could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|While {{shooting}} the final scenes on the wharf of Fiumicino, Fellini suffered a severe bout of clinical depression, {{a condition that}} he and his associates <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> secret. He was able to complete the filming only upon receiving treatment by a prominent Freudian psychoanalyst.|$|E
5|$|Republican Rep. Joe Stengel was term-limited in 2006 {{and could}} not stand for {{re-election}} to the Colorado House of Representatives from House District 38; both Rice and Republican Matt Dunn sought election to Stengel's house seat. The race was a top target for the Colorado GOP, who unsuccessfully <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the seat in Republican hands during a year where Republicans lost ground both nationally and in Colorado.|$|E

5|$|Românul Literar <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up {{with the}} latest {{developments}} in literary form, and Caion was among the first Romanian reviewers of Futurism. However, the paper went out of print in January 1911. It was reestablished as a bi-monthly on November 1, and again ceased publication in December. It was restored a third and final time in June 1912, but went out of business soon after.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> alive {{the idea of a}} {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In his speeches and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 32,400 coins {{on which}} Morgan had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a higher relief were struck in January 1922. While all were {{believed}} to have been melted, one circulated example has surfaced. Also, high relief 1922 proof dollars occasionally appear on the market and it is believed that about six to 10 of them exist. The new low-relief coins, which Fraser accepted on behalf of the Commission, though under protest, were given limited production runs in Philadelphia in early February. When the results proved satisfactory, San Francisco began striking its first Peace dollars using the low-relief design on February 13, with Denver initiating production on February 21, and Philadelphia on February 23. The three mints together struck over 84million pieces in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{then tried}} to change the deal with Dart. Instead of {{dividing}} the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> all the slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold {{his interest in the}} slaves to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated and bitter, and Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast first took up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, because she was a friend of his wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E

5|$|In the sixth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel's {{marriage}} is {{established to be}} a drunken mistake. Ross and Rachel try to get an annulment because he doesn't want to have three divorces. However, he realized he couldn't do so and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their wedding a secret from Rachel. Nonetheless, they divorce several episodes later. Monica and Chandler move in together, causing Rachel {{to move in with}} Phoebe. Joey lands a role on a cable television series called Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E., where he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating one of his students, Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden). The relationship ends because of their maturity differences. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe moves in with Chandler and Monica. Chandler proposes to Monica, who says yes even though her ex-boyfriend Richard confesses his love for her.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner sought {{increased}} {{integration with}} other Latin American countries. He revived {{and tried to}} strengthen the Mercosur trade bloc and improved relations with Brazil, but without automatically aligning with that country, the regional power of South America. The president <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a middle ground between Brazil and Venezuela, since he considered the Brazilian Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva too conservative, and the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez too anti-American. Kirchner worked with centre-left presidents Lula and Chilean Ricardo Lagos and the left-wing rulers Chávez, Fidel Castro from Cuba and Evo Morales from Bolivia. He established a political alliance with Chávez's government, and by 2008, Argentinian exports to Venezuela were quadruple what they were in 2002. A bilateral military commission was established with Venezuela, through which some technological exchange took place.|$|E
5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name {{from the fact that it}} carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E

After several uncomfortable situations in which they continue <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the secret and a rather animated argument in a photobooth, Andy declares to the entire building that he has been on [...] "two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well and there will probably be more."

5|$|Shankly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> busy in {{retirement}} {{and stay in}} touch with football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{fractional}} {{currency in}} three-cent denominations {{did not appear}} until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold in lots, of about 4%. The Philadelphia Mint <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director James Pollock noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded {{despite the fact that}} their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that they were put aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal {{at a time when the}} public was forced to accept flimsy pieces of paper instead of silver and gold.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E

5|$|After {{an anxious}} journey of nine days {{during which they}} were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear {{the results of a}} {{demonstration}} by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty handed. (In all likelihood Metternich's large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as they}} {{received}} the news, Rana Bahadur and his group proceeded towards Kathmandu. Some troops were sent by Kathmandu Durbar to check their progress, but the troops changed their allegiance when they {{came face to face}} with the ex-King. Damodar Pande and his men were arrested at Thankot where they were waiting to greet the ex-King with state honors and take him into isolation. After Rana Bahadur's reinstatement to power, he started to extract vengeance on those who had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him in exile. He exiled Rajrajeshhwori to Helambu, where she became a Buddhist nun, on the charge of siding with Damodar Pande and colluding with the British. Damodar Pande, along with his two eldest sons, who were completely innocent, were executed on 13 March 1804; similarly some members of his faction were tortured and executed without any due trial, while many others managed to escape to India. Rana Bahadur also punished those who did not help him while in exile. Among them was Prithvipal Sen, the king of Palpa, who was tricked into imprisonment, while his kingdom forcefully annexed. Subarnaprabha and her supporters were released and given a general pardon. Those who had helped Rana Bahadur to return to Kathmandu were lavished with rank, land, and wealth. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second kaji; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen's brother, was made the mul kaji; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur's half-brother, was made the mul chautariya; while Rangnath Paudel was made the raj guru (royal spiritual preceptor).|$|E
5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford Meek, Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones Meek had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together an outfit at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found out his own men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were still his men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage had been done to their relationship.|$|E
