5|$|Following the victory, {{the largely}} UT crowd {{stayed in the}} stands to {{celebrate}} the Longhorns' return to the Rose Bowl—this time for {{a shot at a}} National Championship. As players circled the stadium giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a section of the railing collapsed and fans spilled onto <b>the</b> <b>sideline.</b> Oneperson suffered injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher.|$|E
5|$|After missing four games, Croyle {{returned}} to start against the Tennessee Titans in Week 7. He was injured on Kansas City's 14th play {{when he was}} sandwiched between two rushing defenders while throwing a pass {{early in the second}} quarter. He limped off the field. He slammed his helmet to the turf once he reached <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> then hobbled down a tunnel. After the game, Chiefs head coach Herman Edwards announced that Croyle would miss the remainder of the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 {{edition of}} the Alabama–LSU {{football}} rivalry kicked off at 7:14p.m. CST on November 5, 2011, before a crowd of 101,821people at Bryant–Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The game was broadcast nationally in prime time on CBS and Verne Lundquist provided the play-by-play commentary, Gary Danielson provided the color commentary and Tracy Wolfson served as <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> reporter. An estimated 20million people watched the game's television broadcast on CBS, and the broadcast earned a television rating of 11.5, the highest rating for a non-bowl, college football telecast on CBS since 1989.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, McGrath {{returned}} to ESPN as college sports sideline reporter and co-host of College Football Live. For the 2016-17 college football season, McGrath worked <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> of ESPN College Football Friday Primetime games, along with Mack Brown and Adam Amin. She also covered <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> for ESPN’s College Basketball telecasts.. In the fall of 2017, McGrath will again work <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> of ESPN's primetime college football games on Friday nights.|$|R

50|$|Greenberg, Golic and Ditka {{served as}} the {{secondary}} team for the September 8, 2008 game, with Suzy Kolber on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> <b>The</b> September 14, 2009 game had Steve Young join Greenberg, Golic and Kolber. On September 13, 2010, Nessler and Trent Dilfer teamed to call the second game, with Kolber again on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sideline</b> 4...g5!? was {{not well}} {{regarded}} {{at the end of}} the 20th century. It weakens several squares—particularly f5 and h5—as they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any more. White can try to exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2.|$|E
5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|When wide {{receiver}} Kelvin Kirk suffered a concussion in a July 1977 {{game against the}} Ottawa Rough Riders, Allison was forced to substitute as a {{wide receiver}}. After playing five regular season games with the Argonauts in 1977, Allison {{was traded to the}} Calgary Stampeders for Rudy Linterman. He played in four games for the Stampeders during the 1977 season. Allison tore his Achilles tendon in September when he was hit while standing on <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and the injury ended his season.|$|E
50|$|While on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> O'Donnell see {{his club}} being relegated {{back to the}} Scottish Championship and after a year on <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> despite making an {{appearance}} against Dumbarton on 29 December 2013, it announced that O'Donnell was released by the club after a four years spell.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{two lines}} are drawn {{on each of}} <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> 28 feet {{from each of the}} endlines, which designates the extent of the {{coaching}} box and bench.

5|$|During {{his nine}} years at Massillon, Brown invented the playbook, a {{detailed}} listing of formations and set plays, and tested his players on {{their knowledge of}} it. He also originated the practice of sending in plays to his quarterback from <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> using hand signals. His overall record at the school was 80–8–2, including a 35-game winning streak. Between 1935 and 1940, the team won the state football championship six times and won the High School Football National Championship four times, outscoring opponents by 2,393 points to 168 over that span. After the early losses to Canton, the Tigers beat the Bulldogs six straight times.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003 NRL grand final {{against the}} Penrith Panthers, the Roosters lost 18–6 {{in what was}} their {{heaviest}} defeat for the year. A decisive moment occurred midway through the second half: with the scores tied at 6-all, Roosters winger Todd Byrne made a clear break down <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> and looked set to score a try before being chased down and tackled into touch by Penrith lock forward, Scott Sattler. From then on, {{the momentum of the}} game was with Penrith. The Roosters' made the Grand Final in 2004, when they ceded a 13–6 half-time lead to be defeated by the Bulldogs 16–13. The match was captain Fittler's last for the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Auburn's Moon Ducote {{broke through the}} line toward the goal with {{blocking}} by Pete Bonner and William Donahue. After Guyon dove at Ducote and missed, Guyon gave chase and tackled him at the 26-yard line. For Auburn's only score Ducote circled around end for 17 yards and lateraled to Donahue, who ran down <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> for a six-yard touchdown. Guyon was {{the star of the}} game, accounting for four touchdowns and having his best day passing. Strupper had touchdown runs of 62 and 50 yards. Auburn was considered a strong team, despite the lopsided score; Ducote and Bonner were the only non-Tech, unanimous All-Southern selections. Tech's starting lineup was Fincher (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Mathes (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Bell (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Guill (fullback).|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:30p.m. EST on December 31, 1995, at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The game's {{officials}} {{were from the}} Atlantic Coast Conference. Michael Dover was the referee, William Wampler was the umpire, and Sam Stephenson was the linesman. A capacity crowd of 70,283 people attended the game, which was televised by the American Broadcasting Company. The crowd was the smallest to attend a Sugar Bowl in the Superdome to that point. Mark Jones was the play-by-play announcer for the broadcast, Todd Blackledge was the analyst, and Dean Blevins was <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> reporter. Approximately 6,041,700 American households watched the broadcast, giving it a television rating of 6.3.|$|E
5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, the Giants started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game. After {{suffering}} through a 1–3 stretch, including a 31–10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, the Giants rallied to win their final three games to secure the second {{best record in the}} NFC at 12–4. The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> through the end zone, and into the tunnel that led to the locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> 4...g5, {{the main}} line {{continues}} with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Tasci {{attracted}} interest from clubs around Europe. Stuttgart's league rival Hamburger SV as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign him. This move was denied by his agent; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only. On 15 July 2010, Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club. After being excluded from the opening game of the season, he made his first appearance in a 3–2 loss against Borussia Dortmund. He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League group stage matchday one in a 3–0 win over Young Boys. He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. In late November, Tasci returned to training with a bandage on his right knee. Once again, he was on <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit. He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich, which Stuttgart lost 5–3. Despite his injury, Tasci would go on to make 26 league appearances. He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg, Tottenham, Málaga and Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on <b>the</b> <b>sideline,</b> and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, and got the ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State {{scored on}} a 22-yard pass from Bill Burke to Irvin from a field goal formation. The most {{important}} play {{early in the game}} was Griese's one-yard run with 47 seconds remaining in the first half to cap an 11-play 95-yard drive to erase the Spartans' 7–3 lead. On the drive, which started after an illegal block on a punt return put Michigan deep in its own field, Howard made a 10-yard run followed by a 51-yard run for a large part of his total of 110 yards. With 2:12 remaining in the third quarter and Michigan holding a 13–7 lead, Woodson made a leaping, one-handed interception, with his left foot landing just inside <b>the</b> <b>sideline.</b> His second interception, on the next Spartan possession, led to a touchdown by Chris Howard that established Michigan's firm control of the game. Woodson was thrown against more than any time since the opener against Colorado. Despite being stifled in the second half, the Spartans remained within six points {{at the start of the}} fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from <b>the</b> <b>sideline</b> across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
