5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma.|$|E

Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. Suryakantam {{was chosen to}} play Gundamma and Chakrapani suggested Kameswara Rao not to make any special efforts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> character look ruthless because Suryakantam had an aggressive body language.|$|E
60|$|Things {{went on in}} {{this way}} until toward the close of 1602, when an {{incident}} occurred which seemed to strike down at once and forever what little strength and spirit the queen had remaining. The Countess of Nottingham, a celebrated lady of the court, was dangerously sick, and had sent for the queen {{to come and see}} her, saying that she had a communication <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> majesty herself, personally, which she was very anxious <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> before she died. The queen went accordingly to see her.|$|R

5|$|Riefenstahl {{was portrayed}} by Dutch actress Carice van Houten in Race, a sports drama film {{directed}} by Stephen Hopkins about Jesse Owens. It {{was released in}} North America on February 19, 2016. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, Olympia, especially about filming the African American star who {{is proving to be}} a politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> a smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|While {{entering}} Puerto San Bartolomé in Baja California {{in early}} 1915, Asama struck an uncharted rock and was badly damaged. It took months to refloat her and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> partially seaworthy. The ship was given temporary repairs at the British naval base at Esquimalt, British Columbia before arriving back in Japan in December where permanent repairs were not completed until March 1917. Asama {{was assigned to}} the Training Squadron later that year and made another cadet training cruise in 1918.|$|E

5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to land, Kiara's depression continues. She attempts {{to kill herself}} by drinking bleach and is rushed to hospital. After she is discharged, Akash realises his love for her, and tries everything <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> happy. The two venture to Las Vegas, as Akash has never gone on a holiday, and they end up in bed together. Kiara tells Akash that she still loves Kunal. Akash insists that she move back in {{with her parents and}} give Kunal a second chance. Akash moves in with his friend and colleague (Joy Sengupta), and plans to return to India on the night of 31 December to start afresh.|$|E
5|$|After winning Miss India World, Chopra {{was cast}} as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller Humraaz (2002), {{in which she was}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> film debut. However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the {{production}} conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments. Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film Thamizhan as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay. A review published in The Hindu was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put {{in the back of her}} neck during her abduction <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of the}} list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> important.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence.
