5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Nadzab, General Sir Thomas Blamey, the Allied Land Forces commander, {{intended}} to exploit his success with an advance {{into the upper}} Markham Valley, which would protect Nadzab from Japanese ground attack, {{and serve as a}} jumping off point for an overland advance into the Ramu Valley to capture airfield sites there. On 16 September 1943—the same day that Lae fell—Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, commander of I Corps, Major General George Alan Vasey, commander of the 7th Division, and Major General Ennis Whitehead, commander of the Advanced Echelon, Fifth Air Force, met at Whitehead's headquarters. Whitehead wanted fighter airstrips established in the Kaiapit area by 1 November 1943 in order to bring short-range fighters within range of the major Japanese base at Wewak. The 7th Division's mission was to prevent the Japanese at Madang from using the Markham and Ramu valleys to threaten Lae or Nadzab. Vasey and Herring considered both an overland operation to capture Dumpu, and an airborne operation using paratroops of the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Blamey did not agree with <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> capturing Dumpu first, insisting that Kaiapit be taken beforehand.|$|E
5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what has happened. The player {{is able to}} press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E

The Brotherhood held its first convention in Chicago in August 1881. The cornerstone of local and regional affiliations in support of common goals was laid out to show ways to maximize the unions bargaining potential. The immediate common goals were wage and hour demands, and death and sickness benefits. The union grew from its 1881 membership of 2000, to 50,000 by 1890, and 100,000 by 1900.|$|E
25|$|ToeJam & Earl creator Greg Johnson {{became a}} fan of Rogue as a {{university}} student. After he left university, he worked on games for Electronic Arts, including Starflight (1986). After the completion of Starflight 2, Johnson conceived ToeJam & Earl—first the characters, then the plot—while {{on a beach in}} Hawaii. The idea was a combination of Rogues gameplay concepts and a lighter version of Starflight's science-fiction themes. Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on Mount Tam in 1989. He related the concept of ToeJam & Earl to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after. Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> randomly generated levels. Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept and he enlisted the aid of producer Scott Berfield to sell the game to management; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with Nintendo.|$|E

The actor told TV Guide's Maloney that he would miss his fellow cast members the most because he had become very close to them. However added that he was looking forward to a [...] "less hectic work schedules and a change of routine". He later told Desmond that [...] "the danger in staying in soap too long is that people start seeing you as that character." [...] Dickson revealed {{that the rest of the}} cast were behind the idea of Frank's exit storyline. They did not want him to be killed off because that would have been [...] "too boring". She added that the serial's producer accepted <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Frank leaving [...] "with a bang".|$|E
500|$|Much {{was made}} of Arsenal's policy of using the League Cup to field youngsters. In order to explain his team selection, Wenger made an analogy between his youth players and hopefuls on The X Factor, a {{television}} programme he admired. He ruled out playing his more experienced players for the match: [...] "We battled {{very hard to be}} in this final {{and it would be a}} reward for this team, which has risen up to every challenge." [...] When contrasting the two teams, Wenger said: [...] "The game of Chelsea is based on experience and power, ours will be based on mobility and movement." [...] Mourinho did not anticipate Arsenal would make a [...] "crazy change" [...] to their team: [...] "Normally, they change players but keep their philosophy, <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> football, their system." [...] He believed the final had the makings of a showpiece event as the competition was not a main target for both clubs; emotions therefore would not dictate matters.|$|E
500|$|One of the Orb's {{most notable}} {{contributions}} to electronic music is <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> blurring {{the distinction between}} sampling and remixing. Albums such as Pomme Fritz, though released {{as a piece of}} original work, consist largely of manipulated samples. Conversely, the Orb's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track, most notably in the case of their single [...] "Toxygene". [...] "Toxygene" [...] was originally commissioned as a remix of Jean Michel Jarre's [...] "Oxygene 8" [...] from Oxygene 7-13. The Orb [...] "obliterated it" [...] and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix, much to the chagrin of Jarre, who reportedly refused to release it; The Orb released the track themselves under the name [...] "Toxygene", which further irritated Jarre, to whom Paterson retorted [...] "The French are always five years behind us, anyway." [...] In statements made after the release of [...] "Toxygene", Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it.|$|E

500|$|Testing {{revealed}} that <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a role-playing game {{based in the}} real world was more interesting in theory than actuality. They chose two real-world inspirations for levels: [...] "highly interconnected, multi-level" [...] spaces and places one cannot normally visit (such as the White House). In practice, they felt that some functions of the real world, such as hotels and office buildings, were not compelling in a game, and that [...] "reality" [...] always lost when up against [...] "fun". Their recreations of notable locations and items such as the Statue of Liberty and payphones were questioned when they did not emulate the actual site or function. Internally, the team began to doubt their investment in a non-player character-driven game as sufficiently interesting. Spector was swayed by this widespread sentiment to have [...] "monsters and bad guys", and the team increased the prominence of several robots and added genetically-altered animals that still fit the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} pitched by Hannah Louise Shearer and Deborah Dean Davis, {{who were also}} given the job of developing the script. The writing of the episode suffered from {{the timing of the}} 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, with Shearer and Dean Davis completing the script in five days. The premise of the story was a combination of <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a story [...] "about a professor whose work wasn't appreciated and had to go off on his own" [...] and that of Maurice Hurley who wanted a story with a time anomaly. The final draft was dated 22 February and featured numerous differences from the filmed version, including Jenice being called Laura, a number of different interactions for the crew, and Riker, Worf and Data all being involved in shutting down Manheim's equipment. The script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed, but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where Data was to fix the time distortions hadn't been completed.|$|E
500|$|The colonial mission, led by future {{governor}} Simon Bradstreet and pastor John Norton, was successful, and King Charles {{announced that}} he would renew the colonial charter, provided the colony allowed the Church of England to practice there. The Endecott administration dragged its feet on implementation, and after months of inaction, the king sent a commission headed by Samuel Maverick, one of the colony's most vocal critics, to investigate. Endecott had advance warning of what the commission was to investigate, and took steps to address in form, if not in substance, some of the expected actions. Charles insisted that all religious dissenters be freed, which Endecott had done long before Maverick's arrival, but he did so by deporting them. Upon the commissioners' arrival, the assembly took up the matter of allowing Church of England activity in the colony. They passed a law deliberately using the king's language, allowing anyone [...] "orthodox in religion" [...] to practice in the colony; however, they also defined such orthodoxy as consisting of views that were acceptable to local ministers. This effectively negated the law, because there were probably no ministers in the colony who would agree that Anglicans satisfied <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> orthodoxy.|$|E

500|$|The date of Ajtony's conquest is also uncertain. His close {{contacts}} with the Byzantine Empire, including his [...] "Greek rite" [...] baptism in Vidin, show that he ruled after the Byzantine Emperor Basil II seized Vidin from the Bulgarians in 1002. The conflict between Ajtony and King Stephen must have occurred before the king appointed Gerard the first bishop of Csanád in 1030. Alexandru Madgearu, who called Ajtony an ally of Samuel of Bulgaria rather than Emperor Basil II, wrote that Stephen I's army occupied Ajtony's realm in parallel with Basil II's 1002 conquest of Vidin. Makkai placed the conquest of Ajtony's realm in 1008. According to Pop, Stephen I decided to invade the Banat after a 1027 Pecheneg raid on the Byzantine Empire and Emperor Constantine VIII's death the following year. Pop also writes that Ajtony's former duchy was not fully incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary until the 13th century because frequent internal conflicts had enabled the Romanians to preserve <b>their</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "Romanian country". Curta rejected the Long Life account of Ajtony altogether, calling it a [...] "family legend" [...] from a 14th-century hagiography.|$|E
