40|$|Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) mostly uses {{proprietary}} software,but {{the interest}} in Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for GEOBIA is growing. This interest stems not only from cost savings, but also from benefits concerning reproducibility and collaboration. Technical challenges hamper practical reproducibility, especially when multiple software packages are required to conduct an analysis. In this study, we use containerization to package a GEOBIA workflow in a well-defined FOSS environment. We explore the approach using two software stacks to perform an exemplary analysis detecting destruction of buildings in bi-temporal images of a conflict area. The analysis combines feature extraction techniques with segmentation and object-based analysis to detect changes using automatically-defined local reference values and to distinguish disappeared buildings from non-target structures. The resulting workflow is published as FOSS comprising both the model and data in a ready to use Docker image and a user interface for interaction with the containerized workflow. The presented solution advances GEOBIA in the following aspects: higher <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> methodology; easier <b>reuse</b> and adaption <b>of</b> workflows; better transferability between operating systems; complete description of the software environment; and easy application of workflows by image analysis experts and non-experts. As a result, it promotes not only the reproducibility of GEOBIA, but also its practical adoption...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} two period model of {{political}} competition in which voters imperfectly observe the electoral promises made to other voters. Imperfect observability generates {{an incentive for}} candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than {{in a world of}} perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, {{and the size of the}} debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues. We show that the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> spending is beneficial, but <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending. 1...|$|R

The election campaign {{is the time for}} political parties to show how they want to act in government. This research aims to analyze what the parties say about their commitment to transparency and how transparent they are, in fact, during the electoral campaign. Thus, it tries to measure the level <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> Partido Popular and Ciudadanos during the election campaigns of 2015 and 2016 for the General Elections. For this, a quantitative and semi- qualitative content analysis was approached from the project of Dader, Campos and Quintana (2011) on the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the organization, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the campaign activity, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the participation with the citizens, <b>Transparency</b> <b>of</b> data and computer tools and the transparency portal.

When the ownership is more concentrated, the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> information disclosure is worse. 3. There is no significant correlation between board size and information disclosure transparency. 4.
