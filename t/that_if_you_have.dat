500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group B, along with Italian club Inter Milan, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It is tough to go to Russia – I always say <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to travel {{more than two hours}} it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man once told me <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have an origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E
500|$|Breaking Benjamin's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} classified as hard rock and alternative rock, more specifically post-grunge and alternative metal, and has commonly been {{noted for its}} consistency. Corey Apar felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin are nothing if not consistent", and Alex Young felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin {{is one of the}} few modern rock bands on the radio <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard any song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized." [...] Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, [...] "Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone – hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval – and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{negatively}} received by several critics, {{with a number}} of them deeming it to be disappointing and lacking in originality; one critic praised the original idea but criticised its [...] "Bollywoodization". The direction was criticised in a number of reviews, though a few critics praised Sinha's pacing of the film and the execution of the action sequences. Some critics pointed to the presence of scenes which were not child-friendly, despite Ra.One being promoted as a children's film. Particular reviews criticised the lack of character development and the film's [...] "incoherently hackneyed morality". A few critics panned the film as a whole, describing it as a [...] "mess"; one review commented, [...] "It's convenient to say <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no expectations from the film, you wouldn't be disappointed." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Fleury {{joined a}} group that {{involved}} his former junior coach, Graham James, fellow NHL player Joe Sakic, and professional wrestler Bret Hart as a minority owner of the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League. He sold {{his share of the}} team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James' conviction for sexually abusing Sheldon Kennedy and another player. After returning from Northern Ireland, he operated Fleury's Concrete Coatings, a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis, until it closed in 2009. He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called Theoren Fleury: Rock Solid: [...] "We want to show people <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a dream, anything is possible with a little ambition," [...] Fleury said of the show. It was not picked up by any network.|$|E
500|$|Sakimoto composes {{his music}} by playing the pieces [...] "briefly on the piano", and then {{working on a}} {{computer}} for more detailed arrangements. The style of Sakimoto's compositions is mostly orchestral; he creates the orchestral sound by playing the music through a sequencer instead of using a real orchestra due to the high cost. When composing a soundtrack for a video game, Sakimoto first sits down with the director or producer {{of the game and}} works out what emotions they want the game to evoke in the player, and after making a demo for them, sets out to create music that fits that feeling. He claims that his style of composition does not change when he works on non-game works such as anime series, saying that only the tone of the pieces is different. He attributes any changes in his style over the years to his desire to constantly keep growing and learning new styles and techniques, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not moved forward in your skill and style over time, [...] "you've wasted your time".|$|E

6000|$|... "I know this, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} what you are, my boy would have borne a dishonoured name, {{and we should}} never have been {{together}} as now." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{theoretical}} basis for thermometers is the zeroth law of thermodynamics which postulates <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B {{are at the}} same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature then A and C are at the same temperature.

2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "you've {{changed a}} lot in three months. I always thought <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How clever!" [...] {{said the}} merry old gentleman, [...] "I knew <b>you</b> would do <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done any {{differently}} {{there would have}} been no point to the fable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{is coming}} home, {{and he said}} I might run on, and tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> time {{to come in to}} the hotel he would tell you about it.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Inayat Khan and Vera met at Manetta's, a {{restaurant}} in Clarges Street, Mayfair. Above all else, Vera wished to confirm that Inayat Khan believed in her own ability to succeed. Confidence {{was the most important}} thing for any agent. However poor Inayat Khan 's jumping or even her encoding, Vera knew that those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Inayat Khan feel that she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Vera began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Inayat Khan looked startled and said: [...] "Yes, of course." [...] Vera then told her about the letter and its contents. Inayat Khan was upset that anybody should think she was not fit for the job. [...] "You know <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any doubts, it is not too late to turn back," [...] Vera said. [...] "If you don't feel you're the type–if for any reason whatever you don't want to go p you only have to tell me now. I'll arrange everything so that you have no embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it." [...] She ended by adding: [...] "For us there is only one crime: to go out there and let your comrades down." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I should say, sir, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> five vessels <b>you</b> {{could do}} it in two trips. Meanwhile I wish you would give me another thirty men to {{strengthen}} the garrison.” ...|$|R

2500|$|You and Senator Kerry {{have said}} that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time. Does <b>that</b> mean <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been {{president}} and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{very glad}} to hear that, boys. It has taken a load off my mind, for I <b>have</b> been {{thinking}} <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not come in to help me, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> got back without being noticed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I well remember," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "that I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no {{experience}} of ill judgments on deceiving appearances, {{you were a}} lucky man. You went hurt at that, and I see why. I'm sorry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the {{advantage}} {{it will be}} to me now is, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a cigar in your mouth I shan't get quite so much of your chatty conversation. Take one, for my sake." ...|$|E
