500|$|The {{ongoing debate}} within the Army about which type of {{anti-tank}} or tank destroyer weapon to use, and what design specifications ought to be included, also hampered the AGF's abilities to field the weapons and provide adequate training. [...] As a result, during their initial employment and use, AGF observers in combat theaters identified several issues, including some as basic as <b>training</b> <b>ammunition</b> for the M3 Gun Motor Carriage being used unknowingly during combat, which obviously limited its effectiveness. [...] Over time, commanders in combat resorted to field expedient measures to solve the problems, including learning to employ anti-tank guns and later tank destroyers in mutually supporting positions, and integrating them with infantry and armor units to maximize their effectiveness {{as part of a}} combined arms effort. [...] The AGF in turn incorporated these lessons learned into mobilization training, so that over time soldiers and units deploying for combat were making use of the most up to date doctrine and tactics.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, the Army's Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM MAS) {{began to}} {{emphasize}} the need for munitions suppliers to begin readying for GCV IFV ammunition needs. [...] Solutions ranged from 25mm to 50mm, but 30x173mm was identified as [...] "the most likely" [...] design to meet lethality and stowed kill requirements. [...] Specific requirements were for airburst capability to defeat infantry targets (with high explosive incendiary recognized as a [...] "less effective alternative"), armor-piercing rounds to defeat material threats, and <b>training</b> <b>ammunition</b> for each tactical round. [...] Potential candidates included five U.S. produced and three foreign-made rounds. [...] On 7 August 2013, a sources sought announcement was made for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement for 30x173 mm ammunition: 2,700 rounds of Mk 238 Mod 1 High Explosive Incendiary-Tracer (HEI-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 258 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); 2,000 rounds of Mk 268 Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer (APFSDS-T); and 2,000 rounds of Mk 317 Target Practice Discarding Sabot-Tracer (TPDS-T). [...] The announcement called for the cartridges to be compatible with the Bushmaster III weapon system, such as XM813 and/or Mk 44 Mod 1. [...] All interested participants had to provide the ammo quantities and associated information {{before the end of}} March 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the aegis}} of {{operation}} Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S. special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters {{at a cost of}} $1billion a year. The CIA has been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012. These weapons have been reportedly falling into hands of extremists, such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL. Around February 2017, the CIA was instructed to halt military aid to Syrian rebels (Free Syrian Army or FSA), which also included <b>training,</b> <b>ammunition,</b> guided missiles, and salaries. Sources state that the hold on aid was not related to the transitions from Obama's administration to Trump's, but rather due to issues faced by the FSA. Based on responses by rebel officials, they believe that the aid freeze is related to concerns that weapons and funds will {{fall into the hands of}} ISIL. Based on information obtained by Reuters, five FSA groups have confirmed that they received funding and military support from an source called [...] "MOM operations room." [...] Several countries besides the U.S. had also contributed to the funding of the FSA. These countries include Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. On April 6, 2017, Al-Jazeera reported that funding to the FSA was partially restored. Based on information provided by two FSA sources, the new military operation room will receive its funds from the coalition [...] "Friends of Syria". The coalition consists of members from the U.S, Turkey, Western Europe, and Gulf states, which previously supported the military operation known as MOM.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the high}} failure rate of DPICM munitions and {{accuracy}} of GPS guided weapons, DPICM artillery shells and missiles have been less used by the U.S. military. As a result, the large quantities of munitions bought during the Cold War were put into war reserve stockpiles. However, as of 2014 most were reaching {{the end of their}} useful life and require disposition. The warheads, which are now old and less stable, must be extracted. The shells are being refilled with explosives, recycling them for use as inexpensive <b>training</b> <b>ammunition.</b> One such round is the M1122, built from recycled shell casings from DPICM rounds that have some explosive filling replaced with concrete. As a training round, the M1122 has one-seventh the explosive impact at one-third the cost of a standard M795 high explosive shell.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the course is {{learning}} to soldier as a combat leader while enduring the great mental and psychological stresses and physical fatigue of combat; the Ranger Instructors (RIs) - also known as Lane Graders - create and cultivate such a physical and mental environment. The course primarily comprises field craft instruction; students plan and execute daily patrolling, perform reconnaissance, ambushes, and raids against dispersed targets, followed by stealthy movement to a new patrol base to plan the next mission. Ranger students conduct about 20 hours of training per day, while consuming two or fewer meals daily totaling about , {{with an average of}} 3.5 hours of sleep a day. Students sleep more before a parachute jump for safety considerations. Ranger students typically wear and carry some 65 - 90 lb of weapons, equipment, and <b>training</b> <b>ammunition</b> while patrolling more than 200 mi throughout the course.|$|E
