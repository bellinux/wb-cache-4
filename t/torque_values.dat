30|$|In this study, {{we could}} not find a {{significant}} relationship between insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> and ISQ <b>value.</b> However, insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> is an important indicator for predicting the progress of implant treatment, and ISQ value is considered to be an important indicator for observing the treatment state of the implant. Currently, the insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> is used as the major decision index for the determination of the loading period on the implant body. Lozano-Carrascal et al. explained that if the insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> shows between 32 to 50  N cm, the implant treatment with immediate loading protocol is able to apply [40]. Also, Anitua et al. applied immediate loading protocol when the insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> was 40 to 65  N cm (the average insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> is 55 [*]±[*] 3.48  N cm) [29]. As described above, the insertion <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> used as a decision index of the loading period of the implant is yet undefined. Therefore, the loading period of the implant should not be determined immediately after insertion but should be determined after careful follow-up observation. When deciding to load period, the ISQ value will be an important decision index.|$|R

50|$|Lug nuts must be {{installed}} in an alternating pattern, {{commonly referred to as}} a star pattern. This ensures a uniform distribution of load across the wheel mounting surface. When installing lug nuts, it is recommended to tighten them with a calibrated torque wrench. While a lug, socket or impact wrench may be used to tighten lug nuts the final tightening should be performed by a torque wrench, ensuring an accurate and adequate load is applied. Torque specifications vary by vehicle and wheel type. Both vehicle and wheel manufacturers provide recommended <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> which should be consulted when an installation is done. Failure to abide by the recommended torque value can result in damage to the wheel and brake rotor/drum. Additionally, under tightened lug nuts may come loose with time.|$|E
50|$|The {{engines of}} the F103 series were a {{development}} of Daimler-Benz {{for a military}} project that never came into being. They were dubbed the Mitteldruckmotor (medium-pressure engines) because of their unusually high BMEP (mean effective pressure, as calculated from brake <b>torque)</b> <b>values,</b> {{which led to a}} good thermodynamic efficiency. The engines had spiral-formed intake channels that gave the fuel-air mixture a good swirl. The engine had Heron-type combustion chambers with broad squish bands, further enhancing the mixture swirl and aiding good combustion. These features made it possible to use very high compression ratios for the time. The initial engine version had a CR of 11.2 to 1 for 98 RON fuel and even the engines intended for 92 RON fuel had a CR of 9 to 1, which was a very unusually high value for the time.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Accurate {{delivery}} of torque to implant screws {{is critical to}} generate ideal preload in the screw joint and to offer protection against screw loosening. Mechanical torque-limiting devices (MTLDs) are available for this reason.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (within 10 %) of friction-style mechanical torque limiting devices (F-S MTLDs) to achieve their target <b>torque</b> <b>values.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen new F-S MTLDs were selected from Astra Tech (25 Ncm, Hader SA, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), BioHorizons (30 Ncm, Dynatorq ITL, Irvine, California, USA), Dr. Idhe (15 - 60 Ncm, Dr. Idhe Dental, Eching/Munich, Germany). Every peak torque measurement was tested ten times before steam sterilization using Tohnichi torque gauge (6 Tohnichi-BTG (-S), Japan). Steam sterilization was performed using a 100 cycle autoclave. Preparation steps were carried out for the devices before each autoclave sterilization cycle. Peak torque measurements were repeated after every sterilization cycle. Mean difference between the measured and the targeted <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> were evaluated before and after aging. Repeated-measures of ANOVA were {{used to compare the}} differences of accuracy between subjects. Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparison. Results: Autoclaving resulted in an increase in the error values (the difference between peak torque and target <b>torque</b> <b>values)</b> in all the three groups studied (P 10 % (maximum 12 %) difference from their <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> in 5 % of the measurements. Conclusion: Steam sterilization effect differs between target torque and measured peak values with an increase trend.

Clinical Implication: Within the limitation of this study the torque output of each individual device deviated in varying degrees from target <b>torque</b> <b>values.</b> However, the majority of the new frictional-style devices tested in this study, delivered fairly consistent torque output within 10 % of their preset target values after sterilization.

30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the primary implant stability is usually performed after placement.

Mobility test is useful for the {{evaluation of}} an implant whose osseointegration was surely obtained, but {{there is a possibility that}} the primary stability could decrease by the impact of the tapping head. On the other hand, the measurement of ITVs and the measurement of implant stability quotient (ISQ) values by using a resonance frequency analyzer are non-invasive, convenient, and objective evaluation methods. Therefore, these methods are used for evaluation in various researches investigating the primary stability including immediate loading implants [8 - 11].|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Some clinicians use a {{handheld}} screw driver {{instead of a}} torque wrench to definitively tighten abutment screws. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the removal torque of one-piece and two-piece abutments tightened with {{a handheld}} driver and a torque control ratchet. Methods: 40 ITI implants were placed in acrylic blocks and divided into 4 groups. In groups one and two, 10 ITI one-piece abutments (Solid®) and in groups three and four, 10 ITI two-piece abutments (Synocta®) were placed on the implants. In groups one and three abutments were tightened by 5 experienced males and 5 experienced females using a handheld driver. In groups two and four abutments were tightened using a torque wrench with <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> of 10, 20 and 35 N. cm. Insertion torque and removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> of the abutments were measured with a digital torque meter. Results: The insertion <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> (ITVs) of males in both abutments were significantly higher than those of females. ITVs in both Solid® and Synocta® abutments tightened with a handheld screwdriver were similar to the torque of 20 N. cm in the torque wrench. Removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> (RTVs) of solid® abutments were higher than those of synocta® abutments.

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the <b>torque</b> <b>value</b> by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R
