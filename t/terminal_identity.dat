40|$|SummaryThe {{choice of}} {{using one of}} many {{possible}} neurotransmitter systems is a critical step in defining the identity of an individual neuron type. We show here that the key defining feature of glutamatergic neurons, the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT- 4 /VGLUT, is expressed in 38 of the 118 anatomically defined neuron classes of the C.  elegans nervous system. We show that distinct cis-regulatory modules drive expression of eat- 4 /VGLUT in distinct glutamatergic neuron classes. We identify 13 different transcription factors, 11 of them homeodomain proteins, that act in distinct combinations in 25 different glutamatergic neuron classes to initiate and maintain eat- 4 /VGLUT expression. We show that {{the adoption of a}} glutamatergic phenotype is linked to the adoption of other <b>terminal</b> <b>identity</b> features of a neuron, including cotransmitter phenotypes. Examination of mouse orthologs of these homeodomain proteins resulted in the identification of mouse LHX 1 as a regulator of glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder that}} affects millions of people worldwide and {{is characterized by a}} loss of dopaminergic neurons along with other deficits. While rare inheritable forms of PD exist, the vast majority of cases are sporadic and their etiology remains poorly understood. Epidemiological studies have increasingly linked exposures to environmental toxins, including a variety of pesticides, to an increased risk of contracting PD. However, it remains unclear as to the mechanism by which these pesticides cause neurotoxicity {{and the extent to which}} individual genetic variability plays a role. Alterations in the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) gene, which packages dopamine and other amines into synaptic vesicles, have been shown to affect PD susceptibility in animal models and epidemiological studies alike. Using live-imaging techniques at the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction, I investigated the functional consequences of altered VMAT trafficking at an intact synapse. I show that mutations in putative VMAT trafficking domains result in abnormal protein localization during synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis, in a manner that is dependent on nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>identity.</b> Using the same approach, I show that the PD-linked pesticide ziram differentially disrupts neuronal activity and synaptic vesicle cycling at functionally distinct nerve terminals. In particular, I demonstrate that endocytosis at aminergic nerve terminals is particularly sensitive to both disruption of VMAT trafficking motifs and exposure to ziram, and that ziram appears to selectivity induce the spontaneous depolarization of these terminals. Additionally, using traditional toxicological approaches, I developed a novel model of paraquat and maneb induced PD in Drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate the general utility of this model for interrogating specific mechanisms implicated in PD etiology. This dissertation discusses my research using Drosophila melanogaster to address basic biological questions fundamental to understanding gene-environment interactions implicated in PD...|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, face {{detection}} on mobile devices is often slow {{and difficult to}} meet real-time detection needs. Zhenyu et al. [5] proposed a real-time face detection method based on optical flow estimation to realize video face detection on mobile devices, which makes the detection accuracy close to the detection accuracy of convolution neural network (CNN) [6] method, and the speed basically meets the requirements of real-time monitoring. It {{can be applied to}} medium- and low-end devices and cannot meet the performance of high resolution. Approximately 90 % of face detection devices in the market are provided with front-end image acquisition while face detection in back-end server. These devices deeply rely on networks, slowing detection down, which are not applicable to the places encountering unsatisfactory network state, thereby consequently worsening application effect [7]. Yu’s [8] Face <b>Terminal</b> <b>Identity</b> Recognition Simulation technology for mobile device network security does not specify what kind of mobile device is suitable for, nor does it verify on Microsoft HoloLens devices. The current face detection in Microsoft HoloLens can only be achieved by remote call of face detection application programming interface (API) which is, however, restricted by network, resulting in slow detection and failing to meet real-time detection demand. This paper introduces the face detection algorithm based on Microsoft HoloLens holographic glasses. Such algorithm is upgraded from Viola-Jones [9 – 12] classical algorithm building on Haar-like [13] rectangle feature expansion and is accelerated relying on two-dimensional convolution separation and image re-sampling technique. Besides, HoloLens depth camera is installed for 3 D face detection and location, thus localizing HoloLens face detection. Compared with existing Microsoft Azure Face API [14], the face detection algorithm, as shown in the experimental results, is more advantageous in terms of detection accuracy and speed. HoloLens enables supplementation and superposition of real and virtual information, creating a half-to-half real and virtual environment. HoloLens furnished with face detection not only betters user experience, but also contributes to smarter and easier life, which can be applied in such fields as social contact, public security, and business management.|$|E
40|$|Neurons in the {{arcuate nucleus}} of the {{hypothalamus}} (ARH) {{play a central role}} in the regulation of body weight and energy homeostasis. ARH neurons directly sense nutrient and hormonal signals of energy availability from the periphery and relay this information to secondary nuclei targets, where signals of energy status are integrated to regulate behaviors related to food intake and energy expenditure. Transduction of signals related to energy status by Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and Neuropeptide-Y/agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP) neurons in the ARH exert opposing influences on secondary neurons in central circuits regulating energy balance. My thesis research focused on the developmental events regulating the differentiation and specification of cell fates in the ARH. My first project was designed to characterize the ontogeny of Pomc- and Npy-expressing neurons in the developing mediobasal hypothalamus (Chapter 2). These experiments led to the unexpected finding that during mid-gestation, Pomc is broadly expressed in the majority of newly-born ARH neurons, but is subsequently down-regulated during later stages of development as cells acquire a terminal cell identity. Moreover, these studies demonstrated that most immature Pomc-expressing progenitors subsequently differentiate into non-POMC neurons, including a subset of functionally distinct NPY/AgRP neurons. The second aspect of my work focused on characterizing Pomc-expressing precursors throughout the brain (Chapter 3). Similar to findings in Chapter 2, Pomc was broadly expressed in many aspects of the developing brain and subsequently down-regulated as cells further differentiated into non-Pomc terminal identities. In the CNS, the percentage of POMC neurons derived from Pomc-expressing precursors are marginal. These findings are of general importance to the field of energy homeostasis research, because many genetically targeted functional manipulations of POMC cells have been induced during early development, a time in which Pomc is expressed in many cells that will not persist into a POMC <b>terminal</b> <b>identity.</b> The off target consequences of these manipulations have yet to be considered. Our work will provide the foundational evidence for potential confounds of targeted genetic POMC manipulations and may help to explain some of the unexpected phenotypes that have arisin using a BAC transgenic Pomc-Cre reagent. My current research efforts are focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism regulating differentiation and cell fate specification in the ARH during gestation and the early postnatal period (Chapter 4). Consistent with the identification of Pomc transcriptional activity during embryogenesis, functional POMC-processing products (β-endorphin and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) are also detected in embryonic hypothalamic extracts (at embryonic day (E) 13. 5 and E 15. 5, respectively). The presence of POMC processing poducts in the embryo, prior to the establishment of circuits regulating food intake, may be involved in the local differentiation events. Preliminary loss-of-function studies are underway to determine the role of POMC processing products in differentiation of hypothalamic terminal fates. Early results from this work indicate that both β-endorphin and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone are critical to the differentiation of the Pomc lineage. The goal of this work is to define the developmental origins of critical components of neuronal circuits that determine body weight. Evidence in the literature supports that maternal signals influence these events, our studies may provide a means to the design of effective strategies to reduce transmission of signals that increase susceptibility to obesity in offspring...|$|E

40|$|LIM-domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb 1) and the LIM-Homeodomain factor (LIM-HD) Islet- 1 (Isl- 1) share {{a robust}} {{functional}} relationship in directing differentiation of developmental progenitor populations. However, their mechanistic role in terminally differentiated cells is uncharacterized. In the developing endocrine pancreas, conditional ablation of either Isl- 1 in the pancreatic epithelium or Ldb 1 in the Pax 6 + pancreatic endocrine progenitors suspended pancreatic endocrine differentiation. In {{light of their}} functional requirement in the developing endocrine pancreas, both factors remain ubiquitously enriched in the distinct, terminally differentiated endocrine cell-types that comprise the adult endocrine pancreas. To determine the requirement for Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 in the mature pancreatic β-cell, I combined physiological characterization of inducible, β-cell-specific loss-of-function mice with high-throughput cistromic and transcriptomic analyses. Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 were required for maintaining the glucose homeostatic role of the mature β-cell {{as well as the}} terminally differentiated status of the β-cell. Consistent with the established mechanistic relationship between Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 in progenitor populations, Ldb 1 and Isl- 1 were co-enriched throughout the β-cell genome. Comparison of our islet- and insulinoma-based cistromic data sets with the glucagonoma Isl- 1 cistrome revealed differential enrichment of Isl- 1 between the immortalized murine α- and β-cell lines; this differential enrichment may underlie the distinct <b>terminal</b> <b>identities</b> of α- and β-cells. Contextualized through the broader role of Ldb 1 -mediated complexes in directing cell fate decisions, my findings in the mature β-cell indicate that Ldb 1 -mediated complexes are likely responsible for directing and maintaining the terminal differentiation status of all pancreatic endocrine cell types. ...|$|R

The easy manipulation, {{maintenance}} and visualization features of the worm have made {{it one of the most}} understood metazoans for linking genetics, anatomy, development and behavior. This thesis work focuses on two aspects during neural development in C. elegans: neuronal asymmetry in the ASEL/R gustatory neurons and terminal fate determination of the AIA interneuron as well as the NSM neurosecretory motor neuron. I have cloned and characterized LSY- 27, a C 2 H 2 zinc finger transcription factor, which is essential in assisting the onset of the LIM homeodomain transcription factor- 6 to repress ASER expressed genes in ASEL. I have also took part in characterizing LSY- 12, a MYST family histone acetyltransferase, and LSY- 13, a previously uncharacterized PHD finger protein, which cooperate with the bromodomain containing protein LIN- 49 and form the MYST complex to both initiate and maintain the ASEL fate. I have also studied the fate determination of several distinct neuronal cell types. I dissected the cis-regulatory information of AIA expressed genes and identified that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor TTX- 3 is required for AIA fate, possibly together with another yet unknown transcription factor. TTX- 3 also acts synergistically with the POU-domain transcription factor UNC- 86 as master regulators for NSM. TTX- 3 may also act as the terminal selector for ASK. This work provides extra evidence for the terminal selector concept and further demonstrates that individual neurons use unique and combinatorial codes of transcription factors to achieve their <b>terminal</b> <b>identities,</b> and that the same regulatory factor can be reused as a terminal selector in distinct cell types through cooperation with different cofactors...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTraditionally, NMDA receptors {{are located}} postsynaptically; yet, putatively {{presynaptic}} NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) have been reported. Although implicated in controlling synaptic plasticity, their function {{is not well}} understood and their expression patterns are debated. We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic <b>terminal</b> molecular <b>identity</b> and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{identification}} {{capacity is}} the maximal iterated logarithm {{of the number}} of messages divided by the blocklength that can be reliably transmitted when the receiver is only inter-ested in deciding whether a specific message was transmitted or not. The identification coding theorem of Ahlswede and Dueck for single-user discrete memoryless channels states that the iden-tification capacity is equal to the Shannon capacity. A new method to prove the converse to the identification coding theo-rem is shown to achieve the strong version of the result. Identi-fication plus transmission (IT) coding, a variant of the original problem of identification via channels, is proposed in the con-text of a common problem in point-to-multipoint communica-tion, where a central station wishes to transmit information reliably to one of N <b>terminals,</b> whose <b>identity</b> is not predeter-mined. We show that as long as log log N is smaller than the number of bits to be transmitted, IT codes allow information transmission at channel capacity.

40|$|Measuring the {{properties}} of endogenous cell proteins, such as expression level, subcellular localization, and turnover rates, on a whole proteome level remains a major challenge in the postgenome era. Quantitative methods for measuring mRNA expression do not reliably predict corresponding protein levels and provide little or no information on other protein properties. Here we describe a combined pulse-labeling, spatial proteomics and data analysis strategy to characterize the expression, localization, synthesis, degradation, and turnover rates of endogenously expressed, untagged human proteins in different subcellular compartments. Using quantitative mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, a total of 80, 098 peptides from 8, 041 HeLa proteins were quantified, and their spatial distribution between the cytoplasm, nucleus and nucleolus determined and visualized using specialized software tools developed in PepTracker. Using information from ion intensities and rates of change in isotope ratios, protein abundance levels and protein synthesis, degradation and turnover rates were calculated for the whole cell and for the respective cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar compartments. Expression levels of endogenous HeLa proteins varied by up to seven orders of magnitude. The average turnover rate for HeLa proteins was ∼ 20 h. Turnover rate did not correlate with either molecular weight or net charge, but did correlate with abundance, with highly abundant proteins showing longer than average half-lives. Fast turnover proteins had overall a higher frequency of PEST motifs than slow turnover proteins but no general correlation was observed between amino or carboxyl <b>terminal</b> amino acid <b>identities</b> and turnover rates. A subset of proteins was identified that exist in pools with different turnover rates depending on their subcellular localization.
