5|$|<b>The</b> <b>saga</b> {{indicates}} that negotiations started peacefully enough, although as time drew on, {{and the weather}} grew worse, a time-pressed Hákon broke off all dialogue. He sent a detachment of ships deep into Lennox, through Loch Longdifferent versions of <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> number the force at forty and sixty shipsled by Magnús, Dubhghall, (Dubhghall's brother) Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí, Aonghus Mór, and Murchad. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that the ships were dragged across land to Loch Lomondwhich {{indicates that}} the invaders would have beached their ships and made portage across the isthmus between the two lochs (between what are today the settlements of Arrochar and Tarbet). <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> vividly describes how the invaders wasted the well-inhabited islands of the loch and the dwellings surrounding the loch. The fact that Hákon tasked his Norse-Gaelic magnates with leading this foray likely indicates that their boats were lighter {{than those of the}} Norwegians, and thus easier to portage from one loch to another; it could also indicate that the undertaking was meant to test their faithfulness to the Norwegian cause.|$|E
30|$|We have {{distinguished}} crustal earthquakes from subduction earthquakes. The {{most significant}} feature of crustal earthquakes is the seismicity along <b>the</b> <b>Sagaing</b> Fault (Figs. 5 and 8). Many crustal earthquakes were well located along <b>the</b> <b>Sagaing</b> Fault. <b>The</b> largest earthquake analyzed {{in this study}} was the Mw 6.9 earthquake of 5 January, 1991. This mainshock, and its two immediate aftershocks, were relocated on <b>the</b> <b>Sagaing</b> Fault. Therefore, this Mw 6.9 earthquake was a right-lateral strike-slip earthquake that occurred along <b>the</b> <b>Sagaing</b> Fault, with a northward rupture propagation.|$|R
50|$|From the {{testimony}} of <b>the</b> <b>sagas,</b> <b>the</b> Norse explorers probably made contact with the native Dorset culture of the region, people whom <b>the</b> <b>sagas</b> term skrælings. Historians suggest the contact had no major cultural ramifications for either side.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>saga</b> tales draw {{attention}} to Sigurd's conversion to Christianity and his use of a totemic raven banner, {{a symbol of the}} Norse God Odin.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>saga</b> then relates how the Earl Maddaðr gave Sveinn guides, and how Sveinn {{travelled}} {{through the}} interior of the country—over mountains, and through woods, away from inhabited areas—until he came upon Strath Helmsdale, near where Ölvir and Frakökk lived. Williams stated that since <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> records that Sveinn approached the area by land, the site of Ölvir and Frakökk's estate was probably located somewhere in the dale of Helmsdale—not where the modern village is situated on the coast. Williams also noted that this area was quite remote from Orkney, and that it may have been outside of the control of the earldom. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that Ölvir and Frakökk had spies on the lookout; however, because of the route taken by Sveinn, they were unaware of his presence until Svienn occupied a certain slope behind their homestead. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that Ölvir and sixty of his men confronted Sveinn, although Þormóður Torfason's account of the incident gives forty. After a short clash, <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> states that, Ölvir's men soon gave way, and many were killed in the ensuing rout. Ölvir survived the clash, and fled up Helmsdale river. Meanwhile, Sveinn and his men continued on towards the houses. The area was plundered, and the houses were burnt to the ground with their inmates still inside—and in this way Frakökk perished. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that Sveinn and his men committed many ravages in Sutherland before returning home. Upon reaching the river, Ölvir fled through the mountains, and is last heard making for the Suðreyjar; he is not mentioned again within the Orkneyinga saga. Later on within <b>the</b> <b>saga,</b> another of Frakökk's grandsons, Þórbjörn 'Clerk', who is a brother-in-law and close friend of Sveinn, has two of Sveinn's men killed for their part in the burning.|$|E
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in the war}} which followed, Thorfinn {{defeated}} Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at {{the east}} end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at Tarbat Ness {{on the south side of}} the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead. Thorfinn, <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering as he passed. A later note in <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms.|$|E
25|$|Philologists have {{generally}} held <b>the</b> legendary <b>sagas</b> in less esteem, {{in terms of}} their literary value, than <b>the</b> Icelanders' <b>sagas.</b> <b>The</b> content is often less realistic, the characters more two-dimensional, and <b>the</b> <b>sagas</b> often borrow themes from each other, and from folk tales.

5|$|Leif and {{his crew}} {{travelled}} from Greenland to Norway in 999 AD. Blown off course to the Hebrides and staying {{for much of the}} summer, he arrived in Norway and became a hirdman of King Olaf Tryggvason. He also converted to Christianity and was given the mission of introducing the religion to Greenland. <b>The</b> <b>Saga</b> of Erik the Red and <b>the</b> <b>Saga</b> of the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200, contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland. The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise. According to <b>the</b> <b>Saga</b> of Erik the Red, Leif apparently saw Vinland for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Liestøl {{suggested}} that the three men were somehow related to Ölvir. Liestøl noted that three names were those of characters in the Orkneyinga saga, which all had connections with the Hebrides. Kali was the original name of Earl Rögnvaldr, whom Ölvir fought for. The earl was named after his grandfather, Kali Sæbjörnarson, who according to <b>the</b> <b>saga,</b> accompanied Magnús 'Barefoot' to the Hebrides, and died there of wounds he received on Anglesey. According to Liestøl, the name Fugl, in a West Norse context, is only found on this inscription and of a minor character in <b>the</b> <b>saga.</b> This character {{was the son of}} Ljótólfr, from Lewis, who negotiated a truce between Sveinn Ásleifarson and Earl Óttarr. In 1922, historian Alan Orr Anderson noted that the mediaeval Chronicle of Man records that Fogolt, sheriff of Man, died in 1183, and Anderson stated that it is possible that Ljótólfr's son was the mentioned sheriff. Concerning the name Ljótólfr, Liestøl also noted that <b>the</b> <b>saga</b> names Ölvir's father Þorljót, and his maternal-grandfather Ljótr. He concluded that the men mentioned on the stone likely lived around the year 1000, about four to six generations before their namesakes in <b>the</b> <b>saga.</b> In consequence, Liestøl {{suggested that}} Kali Sæbjörnarson would have been a contemporary of the children of the rune-stone's Kali Ölvisson. The stone, among many others, is housed in the museum at Iona Abbey.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} characters of the Orkneyinga saga is the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, who lived on the island of Gairsay, in Orkney. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> relates how Sveinn's father, Óláfr Hrólfsson, was one of several chieftains who supported Páll Hákonsson, Earl of Orkney, in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by Ölvir Rósta in support of Rögnvaldr Kolsson, who had been appointed the earl of half of Orkney by the King of Norway. Óláfr was later burned to death inside his own house by Ölvir, the grandson of Frakökk, an ambitious woman, portrayed as a villain in <b>the</b> <b>saga.</b> Frakökk attempted to win the Earldom of Orkney for her descendantsparticularly Ölvir.|$|E

5|$|SaGa is {{a series}} of science fiction {{role-playing}} video games produced by Square, now Square Enix. The series originated on the Game Boy in 1989 as the creation of Akitoshi Kawazu. It has since continued across multiple platforms, from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the PlayStation 2, and like the Final Fantasy series, the story in each SaGa game is independent of its counterparts. The music of <b>the</b> <b>SaGa</b> series consists of musical scores and arranged albums from various composers. Some of these composers have created soundtracks and pieces for other Square Enix franchises including the Final Fantasy series and Mana series. <b>The</b> <b>SaGa</b> series is divided up between the original series, released as the Final Fantasy Legend series in North America, the Romancing SaGa series, <b>the</b> <b>SaGa</b> Frontier series, and Unlimited SaGa.|$|E

5|$|The Chronicle of Lanercost {{states that}} a Norwegian fleet sailed down {{the west coast}} of Scotland in 1230 with a certain Óspakr-Hákon (d. 1230), who had been {{appointed}} King of the Isles by the King of Norway; also amongst the fleet were Óláfr and Guðrøðr. The Eirspennill version of Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, the most authoritative version of <b>the</b> <b>saga,</b> gives a much more illustrative account; although it does not specifically state that Guðrøðr travelled with the fleet from Norway. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that in the summer before the fleet left Norway, news of warring in the Isles reached the Norwegian king, Hákon Hákonarson (d. 1263). Óláfr is described as a faithful vassal of the Norwegian king, while two Hebridean noblemen, Donnchad and Dubgall—both sons of Dubgall mac Somairle (fl. 1175)—are described as unfaithful. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> relates how the Norwegian king summoned an assembly that winter, appointed Óspakr-Hákon King of the Isles, and decided upon a plan to give him a military force to command in the Isles.|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how Ljótólfr was a {{friendly}} acquaintance of the Viking chieftain Sveinn Ásleifarson, {{who is one}} of the major characters of the entire saga. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that Ljótólfr housed Sveinn for some time on Lewis, and took in Sveinn's brother, who was banished from Orkney. Ljótólfr's son, Fugl, appears in <b>the</b> <b>saga,</b> although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's negotiates peace between the two. Several historians have considered Ljótólfr to be an ancestor of Clan MacLeod; one of these considered Ljótólfr to be the eponymous ancestor of the clanalthough the current understanding of the clan's ancestry regards another man as the eponym.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>SaGa</b> Series 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack -Premium Box- is a soundtrack album {{collection}} {{of music from}} every released SaGa game. The compilation features 515 tracks on 20 CDs with a total length of 19:02:45, and includes a DVD of developer interviews, a stand display showing an illustration painted by Tomomi Kobayashi, and materials to build a display box for the CDs. The set consists {{of all of the}} soundtrack albums from <b>the</b> <b>SaGa</b> series, with All Sounds of SaGa broken up into one disc per game, rather than the original two discs. The set was published on August 26, 2009 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the release of the first SaGa video game with the catalog numbers SQEX-10145~65. Patrick Gann described it as an excellent collection that was worth the purchase for anyone who wanted to own the entire set and did not already have most of the albums, though he noted that as it included multiple composers and styles the compilation box would not be justified for everyone who liked just some of the music of <b>the</b> <b>SaGa</b> series.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>saga</b> {{states that}} some time later, Sveinn {{approached}} Earl Rögnvaldr, {{and asked the}} earl for men and ships to take vengeance upon Ölvir and Frakökk {{who were involved in}} the burning of his father. The earl consented to this request, and gave Sveinn two ships. Sveinn travelled south to Borgarfiörd, and then west to the trading place of Dúfeyrar. According to Anderson, Borgarfiörd may refer to the Moray Firth; and Dúfeyrar likely refers to the shore in the parish of Duffus, on the coast of Moray. <b>The</b> <b>saga</b> states that from Dúfeyrar, Sveinn travelled to Ekkialsbakki, and from there went to Atholl, where he met Earl Maddaðr. Anderson stated that Ekkialsbakki, in this case, likely refers to the coast on the Moray Firth, next to Atholl; The 19th-century historian William Forbes Skene agreed with this, specifically locating it to Findhorn, where ships could enter an estuary and follow a route into Atholl. However, Hermann Pálsson and Paul Geoffrey Edwards, in their 1981 translation of <b>the</b> <b>saga,</b> identified the town of Banff with Dúfeyrar, and the River Oykel with Ekkialsbakki.|$|E
