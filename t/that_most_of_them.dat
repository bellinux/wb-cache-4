5|$|Spitta {{described}} Bach's chorale cantatas {{rather as}} a group than as a cycle, and thought <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> including BWV10, were not composed before the mid-1730s.|$|E
5|$|Today {{those songs}} are {{classics}} but, at that time, {{they were considered}} cutting edge. Eventually I realized <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it inherits. Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

[...] "Well, I've {{been told that}} on one occasion when the commander-in-chief sent for some soldiers for special duty, and found <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> were drunk, he turned an' said, `Send me some of Havelock's saints: they can be depended on!' I'm not sure if I've got the story rightly, but, anyhow, that's what he said." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{project was}} entirely {{a labor of}} love from the artists <b>that</b> participated. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{completely}} donated their time and work to the project. The majority of the profits were donated to Compassion International.|$|R
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, pointed out <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> from {{the thirteenth century}} onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had no further seizures. Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third {{of his body}} and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 the Embassy of South Korea {{opened in}} Washington, DC. In 1960 {{there were about}} 400 to 500 ethnic Koreans in <b>that</b> city. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were wives <b>of</b> former U.S. soldiers, students, and embassy staff.|$|R
60|$|The {{consequence}} of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the very first week in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was above 3000 fell sick <b>that</b> week, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> new-comers, too.|$|R

5|$|However, in 1512, Navarre was {{invaded by}} Castile and Aragon. The Spanish forces led by King Ferdinand quickly {{occupied}} the Iberian {{half of the}} kingdom, including the capital Pamplona; in 1513, he was proclaimed King. In 1515, Navarre was formally annexed by the Crown of Castile {{as one of its}} kingdoms. With this conquest, the 1501–02 edict of conversion came into effect in Navarre, and the Inquisition was tasked with enforcing it. Unlike in Castile, however, few Muslims appeared to accept the conversion. Historian Brian A. Catlos argues that the lack of baptismal records and a high volume of land sales by Muslims in 1516 indicate <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> simply left Navarre to escape through the lands of the Crown of Aragon to North Africa (the Crown of Aragon was by this time inhospitable to Muslims). Some also stayed despite the order; for example, in 1520, there were 200 Muslims in Tudela who were wealthy enough to be listed in the registers.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's future {{had been}} {{referred}} to Sixth Army Group, the controlling formation, for further consideration; after some debate, they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on the enlisted men of the unit. The second inspection showed that the enlisted men were broadly competent at their duties, but <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> preferred rear-area duties over combat roles. The inspection recommended that the enlisted men be transferred {{to one of the}} segregated infantry divisions. In the event, the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters, where it was used in a service role. It remained nominally active—to avoid the political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit—but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
60|$|The {{consequence}} of this was, that the bills increased again four hundred the very first week in November; and, if I might believe the physicians, there were above three thousand fell sick <b>that</b> week, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> newcomers too.|$|R
50|$|These {{reformed}} calendars generally {{remained in}} use until the fifth or sixth century. Around <b>that</b> time <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, {{but with a}} year starting in September to reflect {{the year of the}} indiction cycle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} don't, Duncan, {{but you know}} <b>that,</b> though <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are good, trusty men, some are mean fellows, who would not {{hesitate}} to shoot you in the smoke and confusion of the hunt. Do give up the idea, for my sake, dear." ...|$|R
5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E
5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E
5000|$|Mad Thinker {{constructed}} android duplicates of {{his favorite}} thinkers in order to populate his own town called [...] "Ponder" [...] and had one of his robots bring Captain America to <b>that</b> town. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were destroyed by Team America and Mad Thinker was arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|R

25|$|The Leipzig citizen Rochlitz remarked in {{his account}} about the Battle of Leipzig, that large crowds of French POWs were held on fields outside the town, begged passersby for food, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> didn't survive this ordeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{special feature}} of Tabriz's malls is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are {{designated}} {{to a particular}} order, such as home appliances, jewelry, shoes, clothes, wedding ceremonies, ladies/babies/men specialties, leather products, handicrafts, agricultural products, computers, electronic components, industrial equipment, piping equipment, chemical materials, agricultural machines, stationery, books, rugs, construction stuff and others.|$|E
25|$|Regarding this model, it is {{necessary}} to emphasize <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (engine and chassis) were made in 1929 and 1930, but due to the Depression, high price, and other factors, were sold in subsequent years. The year it was bodied is used to date a particular J, though the chassis was made in an earlier year.|$|E

50|$|The {{irregular}} Swiss {{branch of}} the Nazi Party also established a number of Party Gaue in <b>that</b> country, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> named after their regional capitals. These included Gau Basel-Solothurn, Gau Schaffhausen, Gau Luzern, Gau Bern and Gau Zürich. The Gau Ostschweiz (East Switzerland) combined the territories of three cantons: St. Gallen, Thurgau und Appenzell.|$|R
40|$|This paper developes an {{evolutionary}} model to discus {{the issue of}} efficiency in non-profit organisations. The ideological commitment <b>that</b> characterizes <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is depicted through {{the introduction of a}} role for moral and social norms. It comes out that attracting motivated employees can be a sufficient condition for efficiency and to a greater extent in large and estabilished non-profit organisation...|$|R
25|$|Brindis de Salas, {{a disciple}} of maestro Ignacio Calvo, {{was also a}} {{composer}} of creole danzas {{and the author of}} an operetta, Congojas matrimoniales. In 1844 his musical career was interrupted by his involvement in the Escalera Conspiracy, for which whites were absolved, but blacks paid dearly. Brindis de Salas was arrested and tortured. He was banished from the island by the Governor, O'Donnell. Returning in 1848, he was imprisoned for two years, and when he eventually was free to think about reorganizing his band, he found out <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been executed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Project Blue Book ended, it had {{collected}} 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were misidentifications of natural phenomena (clouds, stars, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the National Reconnaissance Office {{a number of}} the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and A-12. A small percentage of UFO reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis. The UFO reports were archived and are available under the Freedom of Information Act, but names and other personal information of all witnesses have been redacted.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{feature of}} the monks is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are itinerant, moving from one monastery or {{location}} to another, never staying {{in the same place}} for long. Many form a floating group of wanderers, where they participate in festivals together, share work and thus form a collective identity. They gather in certain places cyclically, particularly on festivals such as Navratri, Maha Shivaratri and Kumbh Mela. Many walk very long distances over a period of months from one sacred location to another, across India, in their spiritual pursuits.|$|E
50|$|Since Welikathara was {{the first}} film in CinemaScope in Sri Lanka, it faced many obstacles, first {{of which was the}} lack of access to cinemas capable <b>of</b> showing <b>that</b> format. (<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been {{reserved}} for US films). This was solved by arranging a cross circuit release, combining cinemas in the three competing circuits at that time- another first.|$|R
