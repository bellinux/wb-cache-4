50|$|Of {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed {{by many to}} be custom-built.|$|R
50|$|From 1905, {{the company}} {{produced}} larger models with four-cylinder engines. The customer could choose <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> from 2.7 to 9.2 litres. A range of trucks and buses was also made.|$|E
50|$|Later Darts {{were rated}} up to 3,245 ehp, and the Dart {{remained}} in production until 1987, some 7,100 having been produced and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> having flown some 170 million flying hours.|$|E
5000|$|The wreck {{site was}} {{discovered}} in 40 feet of water off Cape Romain by underwater archaeologist Dr. E. Lee Spence in 1979.

50|$|Photographs show that, {{after being}} {{returned}} to Pretoria, <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> <b>Type</b> MP1 tender {{was replaced by}} a larger Type MT2 tender with a 14 lt t coal capacity, a 6000 imp gal water capacity and a 17 lt 15 lcwt kg axle load. The total weight of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and <b>Type</b> MT2 tender in full working order was 142 lt 15 lcwt kg. The Pretoria enginemen considered the Class 20 to be one of their best locomotives since it was free-steaming, more than usually trouble-free and able to handle any load they gave it.|$|R

50|$|International Aero Engines is a {{consortium}} backed by four aero-engine manufacturers, formed in 1983 to produce <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> FAA <b>type</b> certification for the V2500 was granted in 1988.|$|R
50|$|With the {{rev limiter}} {{disabled}} it {{is capable of}} 228 km/h and can exceed 7,500rpm (at high risk of engine failure) in fourth gear. The rev limiter is set to 6,150rpm. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> was a 351 Cleveland (carried over from the XW GT/GT-HO Phase II).|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{the engines}} were {{planned to be}} of Finnish design (Wärtsilä Vaasa 8R22), but after tests with two {{prototype}} locos, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> was changed into French Pielstick 12PA4-V-200VG. The Pielsticks produced originally , but in 1997 they were limited to an output of [...] to increase durability.|$|E
50|$|In retrospect, the F.XXIV was {{a direct}} {{predecessor}} of the Fokker F27 Friendship built from the 1950s on. Its basic design layout was similar with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> as the main difference as the F27 had turboprops whereas the F.XXIV was designed to have radial engines. The F27 also was considerably larger.|$|E
50|$|Each of <b>the</b> three <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> {{intended}} for <b>the</b> three {{stages of the}} Vega had to be commissioned with two test-firings - one for design evaluation {{and one in the}} final flight configuration.|$|R

5000|$|Before each {{run down}} the drag strip, or [...] "pass", each racer {{and his or her}} car are {{displayed}} to the contestants, who are then permitted to each ask a single question about the car or driver, such as the size or power of <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> and size of the tires, and the driver's previous experience.|$|R
50|$|The {{weakness}} of Eagle Mk III engines was excessive wear of cylinder liners. The problem was fixed with silicon carbide treated liners which {{were taken into}} use in 1980, after which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> became called Rolls-Royce Eagle Mk III “Finlandia”. The more durable liners were later mounted also in the older engine types.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{operation}} of Malta buses, many of the drivers were also mechanics, and a high number of Malta buses proudly displayed the name of the manufacturer of the chassis or body of the bus, or <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> used. In some instances though, these names are not actually the name of the bus in question.|$|E
50|$|The {{appropriate}} response to compressor stalls {{varies according to}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> and situation, but usually consists of immediately and steadily decreasing thrust on the affected engine. While modern engines with advanced control units can avoid many causes of stall, jet aircraft pilots must continue to take this into account when dropping airspeed or increasing throttle.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables <b>the</b> two-stroke <b>engine's</b> intake timing to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port <b>type</b> <b>engines.</b> <b>The</b> piston-port <b>type</b> <b>engine's</b> intake timing opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R

50|$|The Etox Zafer costs between 85,000 and 150,000 TL (50,000 and 88,000 USD) {{depending}} on <b>the</b> model and <b>engine</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
50|$|BMW uses a three-segment {{nomenclature}} for motorcycles. The first segment indicates <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type,</b> {{the second}} indicates the approximate engine displacement in cubic centimeters (with one notable exception: the F 650 GS, {{which has an}} engine displacement of 798cc), while the third indicates the class of motorcycle (e.g., sport, sport touring, dual-sport, etc.). The three segments are separated by blanks.|$|E
5000|$|To {{discriminate}} cartridges by engine (MC vs MM) {{overlooks the}} fact that the stylus tip shape (conical vs elliptical vs advanced shapes), mounting (bonded vs nude), cantilever material (aluminum vs boron vs beryllium) and cantilever design (solid rod vs rolled tube) have a significant influence in the sound, and this may account for more variation of sound quality than <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> used.|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} vehicle toured with a Tampella 122 K 60 cannon, {{fitted with}} hydraulic drive, in agricultural fairs in Finland {{where it was}} displayed at the Defence Forces' stand. Neither the vehicle, nor the cannon entered serial production; KB-46 was designed {{in a short time}} and there was used many new technical solutions without previous experience. Hence, there appeared several defects. Also <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> proved technically failed.|$|E
50|$|Turbofans {{differ from}} {{turbojets}} {{in that they}} have an additional fan at the front of <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> which accelerates air in a duct bypassing the core gas turbine engine. Compared to a turbojet of identical thrust, a turbofan has a much larger air mass flow rate. Turbofans are <b>the</b> dominant <b>engine</b> <b>type</b> for medium and long-range airliners.|$|R
25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine {{is defined as a}} vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|R
50|$|When {{the need}} arose, the coal {{capacity}} of tenders was sometimes increased by makeshift means, such as constructing wooden extensions for the bunker sides. In the example depicted, the Cape of Good Hope Governor's train is shown arriving in Fort Beaufort behind CGR 7th Class no. 722 for the official {{opening of the}} railway station in 1904. <b>The</b> <b>engine's</b> <b>Type</b> ZC tender's sides had been raised by installing {{what appears to be}} planking, to allow a greater coal load. In addition, an open gondola-type goods truck between the tender and the passenger carriage is loaded with more coal and two workmen.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} Saab 21R first flew on 10 March 1947, almost 2 {{years after}} the Second World War. The aircraft first entered service with F 10 in August 1950. Although the type was originally intended as a fighter aircraft, a newly developed fighter, the Saab J 29 first flew in October 1948, the number to be produced was halved from 120 to 60, and eventually all 21Rs were converted to attack aircraft as A 21RA or the A 21RB depending on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sanglas {{models were}} {{a hybrid of}} English and German models. The chassis {{was based on the}} concept of BMW and <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> <b>type</b> monoblock, 4-stroke single cylinder, OHV type, was {{inspired}} by DKW brand. The first motorcycle had a displacement of 347,75 cc. and 14.4 HP power at 4,800 rpm.At the end of 1948 the company already had 100 employees and had manufactured 200 units.The first model, 500 cc with a rear chassis renovated to be able to accommodate an oscillating fork and two hydraulic shock absorbers, was launched in October 1952.|$|E
50|$|This will {{normally}} give a value {{somewhere between}} 800 and 880. The lower the value {{is the better}} the ignition quality. Fuels with a CCAI higher than 880 are often problematic or even unusable in a diesel engine. CCAI are often calculated under testing of marine fuel.In case of high CCAI, the manufacturers recommendations and guidance limits should be consulted {{to ensure that the}} fuel falls within the permissible range for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>type.</b> Attention should be given to the combustion profile, peak pressures and exhaust temperatures on the Engine.|$|E

5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using <b>the</b> R <b>engine.</b> In <b>the</b> two decades before World War II, {{the quest to}} break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: <b>the</b> Liberty <b>engine,</b> Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> used in <b>the</b> 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero <b>engine</b> design at <b>the</b> time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|R
