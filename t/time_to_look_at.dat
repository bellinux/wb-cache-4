500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Miracles" [...] {{focus on the}} {{extraordinary}} events humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged, and encourages listeners to take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world and reevaluate their life. The song's music is built around an ascending synthesizer melody, and climaxes with an electric guitar solo performed by Mike E. Clark, and beatboxing by Joseph Utsler. [...] "Chop Chop Slide" [...] {{was inspired by the}} [...] "Cha Cha Slide".|$|E
2500|$|Once it {{had been}} passed, on 23 April 1956 the Speaker who had been elected {{temporarily}} (W. F. McCoy) resigned. Stronge was re-elected on 26 April, referring in his speech accepting the nomination to his time away from Parliament looking after his farm: [...] "I have had more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> bullocks, and more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their prices".|$|E
2500|$|... "He simply {{shifted his}} weight more to one side than the other. This careened the ship to one side. She turned her nose away from the clump of sprouts when within fifty yards of them and took her course around them as prettily as a yacht on the sea avoids a bar. The ability to control the air ship in this manner {{appeared}} to give Whitehead confidence, for he was seen to take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the landscape about him. He looked back and waved his hand exclaiming, 'I've got it at last.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{execution}} chamber, Michael {{raised his head}} several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the window into the witness chamber as his death warrant was being read. The last words he mouthed to two of his sons and a daughter-in-law who witnessed {{the execution}} were simply [...] "I love you,".|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I couldn't {{wear this}} gown {{to be married}} in now!' she replied, ecstatically, 'or I shouldn't have put it on and made it dusty. It is really too old-fashioned, and so folded and fretted out, you can't think. That was with my taking it out so many <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> I have never put it on--never--till now!' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{settling}} {{upon his}} subject, Frank set to work, and, {{except that he}} went out for five minutes to buy and eat a penny loaf, continued his work till nightfall. The old man came in several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, but each time went out again without making a remark. At six o'clock Frank laid down his tools.|$|R
2500|$|Stirling {{majored in}} {{anthropology}} under Alfred L. Kroeber, {{graduating from the}} University of California in 1920. His interest in the Olmecs began in about 1918, {{when he saw a}} picture of a [...] "crying-baby" [...] blue jade masquette, published by Thomas Wilson of the Smithsonian Institution in 1898. When he traveled to Europe with his family after graduation, he found the masquette itself in the Berlin Museum, and intrigued by the Olmec culture, took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other specimens in the Maximilian Collection in Vienna, and later, in Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|Inspiration for the song's lyrics came via the Internet {{generation}} and group members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope raising children. In response to both modern jadedness {{and their children}} experiencing wonders {{of the world for}} the first time, the group wanted to write a song about natural phenomena humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged. The closing lyrics encourage listeners to take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world and [...] "appreciate the things that life has to offer". According to Violent J, [...] "What's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can’t even see the miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet." [...] He believes that scientific explanations can sometimes kill the intriguing mysteries of the world, such as how ancient pyramids were made. Violent J admits that the song's lyrics discuss [...] "things [...] may not be actual miracles. They may have scientific facts explaining them [...] But nonetheless, these things are still incredible [...] and they should be appreciated." [...] He added that the group's use of the word 'miracle' was intended to mean [...] "something fuckin’ amazing and incredible, [...] special, awesome event, [...] a great, wonderful thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, Mr. Kenneby, I'll {{ask you a}} few questions," [...] he said; and Kenneby turned {{round to}} him. The {{barrister}} spoke in a mild low voice, but his eye transfixed the poor fellow at once; and though Kenneby was told a dozen <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the jury and speak to the jury, he never was able to take his gaze away from Mr. Furnival's face.|$|R
60|$|Miss Cooper <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him indignantly, and, {{biting her}} lip, turned away, {{and started a}} desperate flirtation with the mate, to punish him. Evans watched them with mingled {{feelings}} as he busied himself with various small jobs on the deck, his wrath being raised to boiling point by the behaviour of the cook, who, being a poor hand at disguising his feelings, {{came out of the}} galley several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Half past ten!' cried Mr Ferguson. 'Why, we're in {{heaps of}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in <b>at</b> the Savoy for supper. This is great. I'll phone {{them to keep}} a table.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{the very}} thing, unluckily. Try to get the answer put off till to-morrow, and that will give <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this letter candidly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. I didn't have much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. I was {{busy trying to}} escape being hit by the tree branches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was so busy, I had no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the papers. I suppose no {{one thought}} it his {{business}} to draw my attention to it.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{answered}} gravely, that he {{had been}} far enough several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a distance into the vast country I spoke of; And such, indeed, it is, said he; and, as we come upon the rising part of the hills we see a great way, and a country without end; but, as to any descriptions of it, I can say but little, added he, only this, that it is a very fruitful country on that side next the hills; what it is farther, I know not.|$|R
60|$|From <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time,</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Oscar sitting {{opposite}} to me, {{to see if}} any change appeared in him as we drew nearer and nearer to the place in which Lucilla was now living. No! Still the same ominous silence, the same unnatural self-repression possessed him.|$|R
60|$|This <b>time</b> {{he turned}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. The old dagger was drawn in her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at your horse's head, Hugh, and pay no {{attention}} to aught else. When we have reached our destination, we shall have plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all these wonders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At first,' said Mark; 'but I {{think he}} will give way when he has had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter, and sees how good you are. That will make all the difference.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, exactly! Just so!" [...] {{burst out}} Andy. [...] "We {{understand}} what you mean, Spouter. But please remember the scenery is there--it won't move--and we'll have lots of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1972 Davies wrote a {{book about}} football, The Glory Game, a behind-the-scenes {{portrait}} of Tottenham Hotspur. Davies also wrote a column about his daily life in Punch called [...] "Father's Day", presenting himself as a harried paterfamilias. In 1974 he was sent by the Sunday <b>Times</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a comprehensive school in action. He wrote three articles and then stayed on at the school - Creighton School in Muswell Hill, North London, now part of Fortismere School - to watch and study through a year in its life. The result was a book, the Creighton Report, published in 1976.|$|R
60|$|He had to {{pass the}} window; and the bright, dark eyes of his debased <b>time</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. Her heart told her who he was; {{she came to the}} door quickly, and fell upon his neck.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{you will}} love and rejoice in your Chaucer more and more. Fancy, I've never <b>time,</b> now, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him,--obliged <b>to</b> read even my Homer and Shakespeare at a scramble, half missing the sense,--the {{business}} of life disturbs one so.|$|R
6000|$|... "The most of them. That is, {{all that}} I thought were of any importance. There {{are a great}} number that I haven't had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> yet. You know how {{numerous}} father's investments are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No they won't," [...] {{interrupted}} the boy; [...] "it's a monstrous big wood they've got {{to pass through}} before they can come here, so we have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> some of the 'stonishin' things." ...|$|E
60|$|The carriage, {{which was}} drawn by three horses abreast, went on very rapidly through these scenes--so rapidly, in fact, that Mrs. Gray had not <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the various groups {{as much as}} she wished.|$|E
60|$|So far we {{have been}} {{considering}} what is true in the contention that capitalism causes modern wars. It is <b>time</b> now <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the other side, and to ask ourselves whether the abolition of capitalism would, by itself, be sufficient to prevent war.|$|R
30|$|Hand out {{one copy}} to each {{person of the}} book that they have chosen. Give them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> read or <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Angut was {{particularly}} restless during the night, {{and got up}} several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the weather, as Rooney expressed it.|$|R
60|$|He turned round this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the speaker, and confronted a wizen, flaxen-haired, sharp-faced man, {{dressed in}} a jaunty shooting-jacket, {{carrying}} a riding-cane in his hand, and having a thorough-bred black-and-tan terrier in attendance at his heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say yet, for I {{have not}} had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> anyone. I will now, if you don't mind." [...] And, to the great {{amusement}} of the rest, Mac gravely adjusted his eyeglasses and took an observation.|$|E
60|$|My late {{guardian}} actually {{stopped his}} horse this <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, and I could perceive deep concern gathering around his usually serene and placid brow. He began to penetrate my feelings, and I believe they caused him real grief.|$|E
