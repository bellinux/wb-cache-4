5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. <b>The</b> <b>pupil</b> can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E

5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of <b>the</b> <b>pupil,</b> and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} <b>the</b> <b>Pupil</b> Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis.

5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E

40|$|This study {{answers the}} {{question}} ‘Is there {{a relationship between}} the perception of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> and <b>the</b> teachers on the cooperative skills of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> and <b>the</b> actual cooperative skills of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> in elementary Montessori education?’ A mixed method cross sectional design including 330 pupils and 12 teachers from elementary Montessori education is used in order to compare the perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> and teachers on the cooperative skills of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> to <b>the</b> actual cooperative skills of <b>the</b> <b>pupils.</b> <b>The</b> findings of the study suggest that:  There is {{a relationship between the}} perception of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> and <b>the</b> perception of the teachers on the cooperative skills of the pupils;  There is no relationship between the perception of <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> on their cooperative skills and their actual cooperative skills;  There is no relationship between the perception of the teachers and the actual cooperative skills of the pupil;  Teachers believe especially communicative skills are necessary for effective cooperative learning. The findings indicate that there is a mismatch between <b>the</b> perception of <b>pupils</b> and teachers and the actual cooperative skills. Therefore it is desirable in research and in education to draw more attention to the perception on cooperative skills. It is also found that the questionnaires used in this study to measure cooperative skills of pupils might not measure cooperative skills correctly.

5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} based on {{empirical}} studies and the approach to this has been interviews {{with a group of}} <b>pupils.</b> <b>The</b> study investigates the use of reading strategies among <b>pupils.</b> <b>The</b> aim is to investigate how <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> use different reading strategies in order to overcome problems that occur when reading fictional texts. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> were also asked some questions about their reading habits and attitudes towards reading. Research has shown that pupils who are introduced to different reading strategies are better readers than those who are not. Reading strategies help the readers make literary texts more comprehensible. As a result of this study, it is shown that there are reading strategies that <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> are familiar with. These strategies are of importance, since {{they are part of the}} pupils’ learning process and help them increase their reading comprehension. They also lead to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> gain and widen their knowledge.

5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, <b>the</b> <b>pupil</b> is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E

40|$|Teachers try to {{introduce}} chemistry concepts to pupils in a comprehensible way by implementing new active forms of teaching into the traditional type of lessons, {{in a way}} that the pupils’ active participation in lessons is ensured. One of the active forms of teaching includes a new teaching approach called GALC – Guided Active Learning in Chemistry, which is presented in detail in the thesis. By implementing various work methods during lessons, teachers provide an additional motivation for pupils to learn chemistry. The theoretical part describes the learning of chemistry concepts by connecting three levels (macro, submicro and symbol levels) and lists certain research projects whose authors examined pupils’ incorrect and incomplete comprehension of chemistry concepts. This is followed by the description of the differences between traditional lessons and modern active lessons. The empirical part includes the comparison of the results of the tests taken by <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> in <b>the</b> experimental group with the GALC teaching approach and by <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> in <b>the</b> control group with traditional lessons. The research involved 118 pupils at two elementary schools in central Slovenia in the school year 2010 / 2011. After a month, <b>the</b> <b>pupils</b> retook <b>the</b> tests; the results revealed the influence of the new teaching approach on the pupils’ comprehension of certain chemistry concepts and the lastingness of their knowledge.
