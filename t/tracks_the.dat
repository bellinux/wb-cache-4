5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new {{material}} for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines.

It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.|$|E
