5|$|Functionalism was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor {{as a reaction}} to the inadequacies of the identity theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> empirical computational theory of the mind. At about the same time or slightly after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E

5|$|Arbroath's {{prospects}} originally {{revolved around}} the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atomic radius. This {{is a measure}} of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|Australian Army {{units were}} {{deployed}} as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender. Under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten, {{the head of}} South East Asia Command, Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo, the NEI east of Lombok (including western New Guinea) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific. The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945. I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI, and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea. After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI. While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists, the Australians were careful to not {{become involved in the}} Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible. Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good, {{due in part to the}} decision by the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI. The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} temporal {{constraints that}} can impose a minimum and maximum time {{distance between the}} occurrences of two events by specifying the minimum and maximum values in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> time granularity.

This paper investigates the problem <b>of</b> converting <b>a</b> distance constraint expressed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> granularity into another one in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different time granularity. An expressive formal model for time granularities is assumed including common granularities like hours and days as well as user-defined granularities like business days and academic semesters...|$|R
