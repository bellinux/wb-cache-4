We compare two different designs of the multiple electrospray system {{in order to increase}} the output for large scale production applications. In this study, the solution was fed through four separate needles that were attached to either a circular or a rectangular metallic plate that were connected to a high voltage DC power supply. The behaviour of the electrospray jets as well as the deposition of particles were investigated. It was shown that the <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> was increased while particles with narrow size distribution were produced from all four uniform electrospray jets...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a continuous process for dissolution of (Th,U) 0 _ 2 -fuel particies from graphite fuel elements of high temperature reactors is described. Several dissolvers and processes were tested in the laboratory with unirradiated <b>particle</b> charges <b>of</b> different dissolution raten. With regard to the planned hot cell operation of the pilot-plant JUPITER, the best procedure is to dissolve the particles continuously in a fixed bed. The dissolver consisted of a tobe with a spherical bottom. The particies were fed from the top with a proportioning screw. Thorex reagent (13 M HN 0 _ 3; 0, 1 M AI(N 0 _ 3) _ 3; 0, 05 M HF) was metered by a pump through a central pipe ending just above {{the bottom of the}} dissolver and flowed upwards through the particle bed. Tests have demonstrated that the amount <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in the dissolver at a steady state operation depends linearly an the specific dissolution rate and <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particles.</b> Scale-up experiments have shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain a <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> 90 kg <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> / 24 hours with a critically safe dissolver...|$|R
40|$|A new, {{turbulent}} flow aerosol reactor is described that enables synthesis of uniformly sized aerosol nanoparticles during a residence {{time of a}} few milliseconds. The short residence time allows processing of high number concentration aerosols, in excess of 10 ^ 9 cm^(- 3), to be processed with minimal coagulation, leading to an aerosol throughput approaching 10 ^(11) particles cm^(- 3) s^(- 1). Turbulent mixing speeds thermal and chemical transport beyond diffusional limits inherent in laminar flow reactors, providing the thermal energy to drive chemical reactions, coalescence, densification, and crystallization <b>of</b> <b>particles.</b> With enhanced transport, residence time in the reactor can be reduced, thus limiting coagulate particle growth while maintaining a high <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> nonlayered or multilayered aerosol particles. The turbulence that enables rapid mixing is generated by dissipation of kinetic energy supplied to the reactor by high velocity gas jets. The apparatus described here increased the throughput {{by a factor of}} 100 above previous laminar flow reactors, and the induced fast mixing enables scale-up to much higher <b>throughput.</b> Characterization <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> by differential mobility analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed uniformity in size and composition...|$|R

The <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> ADS submicron <b>particles</b> generation by emulsification/internal gelation is limited by its wide size distribution. The aim of this work was to study the recovery protocol influence on ADS particles through the determination of its impact on particles’ size distribution and bioactivity. ADS particles showed a wide and multimodal distribution, characterized by a high aggregation phenomenon. In an attempt to reverse particles’ tendency to aggregate and to homogenize particle size ADS populations were submitted to ultrasonication, while particle size distribution, physical and chemical stability, and the bioactivity of entrapped insulin were investigated. After ultrasonication a narrower particle population shifted to the nanoscale, with higher physical stability and significant insulin bioactivity was obtained. Emulsification internal/gelation followed by ultrasonication constituted a valid strategy to obtain ADS particles at the submicron range, with high stability and without significantly compromising insulin bioactivity, so offering promises, under previously well established conditions, to evaluate impact <b>of</b> ADS <b>particle's</b> size on biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetics phases...|$|R
40|$|Plasmon {{enhanced}} micromanipulation addresses some of {{the drawbacks}} associated with more traditional optical based methods, particularly {{in regard to the}} nature of laser excitation required for actuation. The resonant electromagnetic field enhancement observed {{as a result of the}} plasmon resonance phenomenon, enables trapping of nanoscale objects, and reduces the risk of photoinduced sample damage by reducing excitation power required for trapping. Plasmon resonance introduces an unavoidable heating effect which hinders stable trapping in microfluidic environments as a result of phenomena such as convection. In this work, the heating associated with plasmon resonance is used constructively, to devise a new micromanipulation technique. Plasmonic nanostructures are patterned on pyroelectric substrates which create an electric field in response to changes in temperature. This electric field results in the generation of local and global electrokinetic phenomena which are used in high <b>throughput</b> trapping <b>of</b> suspended <b>particles.</b> To demonstrate the versatility <b>of</b> this technique, <b>particles</b> are patterned into arbitrary shapes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} simple-to-implement method for {{analyzing}} images <b>of</b> randomly distributed <b>particles</b> transported through a fluidic channel. We term this method particle imaging, tracking and collocation (PITC). Our method uses off-the-shelf optics including a CCD camera, epifluorescence microscope, and a dual-view color separator to image freely suspended particles {{in a wide}} variety of microchannels (with optical access for image collection). The particles can be transported via electrophoresis and/or pressure driven flow to increase <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> analysis.

The channel to each receiver {{is assumed to be}} in one of two states (ON or OFF) and the channel states of the receivers are assumed to be independent of each other. The goal is to compare the <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> two different scheduling policies given an upper bound on the queue overflow probability or the delay violation probability. The two scheduling policies that we {{consider a}}re: (i) a greedy scheduling policy which chooses to serve any of the channels in the ON state, and (ii) a queue-length-based policy which serves the longest queue connected to an ON channel. We show that the total network <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> the queue-length-based policy is no less than that of the greedy policy for all N and is strictly larger than the <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> the greedy policy for large N. Further, given an upper bound on the delay violation probability, we show that the <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> the queue-length-based policy is an increasing function of N while the <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> the greedy policy eventually decreases with increasing N and goes to zero.

40|$|Upon {{examining}} current {{methods for}} printing and patterning of live biological cells, {{there is a}} need for a method capable of printing with the resolution of single biological cells to organize them into complex structures. In order to fill this need, building upon previous design of a dynamic lithography system, a stop flow lithography system was implemented capable <b>of</b> patterning individual <b>particles</b> with a mean accuracy of 11. 92 [mu]m and a standard deviation of 4. 63 [mu]m. This was achieved by improving the tracking capability of the software by measuring the exposure vs velocity relationship to anchor the particle as well as implementing a stop flow lithography based software approach. With the goal of producing 3 D functionalized tissue, a 3 D printing module was constructed for the dynamic lithography system that constructed microscale parts with a minimum layer height 16. 42 [mu]m of and planar resolution of 10 [mu]m, comparable to the top available micro-scale 3 D printers. To push the capability of the system, I analyzed and presented the limitations of the process via an opto-thermal model, and a computational fluid dynamics model which is then studied through a previously developed throughput analysis to get a theoretical maximum output of the system. In analyzing the limitations of the printing process, maximum input optical system power was characterized, and a theoretical maximum system <b>throughput</b> <b>of</b> 10, 000 <b>particles</b> per second was calculated.
