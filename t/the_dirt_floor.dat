500|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona was {{temporarily}} usurped through the trickery {{of his son}} Andriantomponimerina, who ruled the western territory from his rova at Ambohidratrimo. Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against {{the people of the}} fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench he dug into <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was [...] "in the ground". Believing his son to be buried alive by the Marovatana as a punitive measure, Andriamasinavalona hurried to Ambohidratrimo carrying reeds as a symbol of peace; upon the king's entrance into the residence, however, Prince Andriantomponimerina locked Andriamasinavalona inside and refused to release him for the next seven years. During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.|$|E
2500|$|Maquinna {{took him}} to a {{neighbouring}} village and paid a bride price for Jewitt's selection, who was indeed the young daughter of the chief. Jewitt then set up his own home in Maquinna's longhouse, building beds so as to not sleep on <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor,</b> and insisting on cleanliness for both his wife and Maquinna's twelve-year-old son, who chose to live with them. Jewitt viewed the marriage as a chain binding him to [...] "this savage land" [...] (p.161).|$|E
2500|$|Inmates emptied their toilet buckets over {{soldiers}} who had thrown the Koran on <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor.</b> After the arrival of General Geoffrey Miller in late 2002 (the abuse by the military was reported as considerably worsened during his command), the inmates coordinated a welcome, emptying their buckets of excrement on him as he walked past their cages. [...] Thereafter inmates called him [...] "Mr. Toilet." [...] For dumping excrement on General Miller, Kurnaz reported prisoners received an extra month of solitary confinement. Later the cellblock was subject to reduced rations, which were halved for about forty days.|$|E

50|$|Phillips was {{deployed}} for Great Britain, {{and served}} in Wales for six months. After this, her assignment {{was moved to the}} English Channel to care for those wounded after the invasion of Normandy. The mission of Phillips's unit was to set up a tent hospital outside of Liége, Belgium to treat Allied soldiers. Work in a field tent was difficult at best. The nurses worked without running water or electricity, and <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> tents often turned to mud.|$|R
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E

60|$|While Tara of Helium {{was being}} led to The Towers of Jetan, Ghek was escorted to the pits beneath the palace {{where he was}} imprisoned in a dimly-lighted chamber. Here he found a bench and a table {{standing}} upon <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> near the wall, and set in the wall several rings from which depended short lengths of chain. At {{the base of the}} walls were several holes in <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor.</b> These, alone, of the several things he saw, interested him. Ghek sat down upon the bench and waited in silence, listening. Presently the lights were extinguished. If Ghek could have smiled he would have then, for Ghek could see as well in the dark as in the light--better, perhaps. He watched the dark openings of the holes in the floor and waited. Presently he detected a change in the air about him--it grew heavy with a strange odor, and once again might Ghek have smiled, could he have smiled.|$|E
60|$|Rapidly Turan {{examined}} each of {{the other}} doors. They were all locked. A glance about the chamber revealed a wooden table and a bench. Set in the walls were several heavy rings to which rusty chains were attached--all too significant of the purpose to which the room was dedicated. In <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> near the wall were two or three holes resembling the mouths of burrows--doubtless the habitat of the giant Martian rat. He had observed this much when suddenly the dim light was extinguished, leaving him in darkness utter and complete. Turan, groping about, sought the table and the bench. Placing the latter against the wall he drew {{the table in front of}} him and sat down upon the bench, his long-sword gripped in readiness before him. At least they should fight before they took him.|$|E

5000|$|The Mathare Valley {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and used to be one of the worst slum areas in Nairobi. People live in 6 ft. x 8 ft. shanties made of old tin and mud. There are no beds, no electricity, and no running water. People sleep on pieces of {{cardboard}} on <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> shanties. There are public toilets shared by up to 100 people and residents have to pay to use them. Those who cannot afford to pay must use the alleys and ditches between the shanties. [...] "Flying toilets" [...] are plastic bags used by the residents at night, then thrown into the Nairobi River, which is the source of the residents' water supply.|$|R
50|$|A large {{addition}} to the original cabin was constructed in the early 18th century. A wooden floor was built over <b>the</b> original <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> around 1730. <b>The</b> house {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and is still privately owned.

60|$|It is not needful {{to recount}} all {{the manner in}} which I prosecuted my search for the gem, for not only did I examine every scrap of paper about the place in hopes of finding some matter {{concerning}} it, but I sounded the walls, and pierced wellnigh every inch of <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> with a sharpened stick of wood, but found not one single sign of it anywhere. I even searched in the pockets of the breeches which the sick man wore, and of his coat and waistcoat, which hung against the wall, but discovered nothing to reward my search--all that I found there being a book of needles and thread, a tailor's thimble, a great piece of tobacco, such as seafaring men always carry with them, a ball of yarn about half the bigness of an orange, and a hasp-knife.|$|E
60|$|And she {{had stepped}} into a broken-down patio {{littered}} with alfalfa straw and debris, all clear in the sunlight. Upon a bench, back toward her, sat a man looking out through the rents in the broken wall. He had not heard her. The place was not quite so filthy and stifling as the passages Madeline had come through to get there. Then she saw {{that it had been}} used as a corral. A rat ran boldly across <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor.</b> The air swarmed with flies, which the man brushed at with weary hand. Madeline did not recognize Stewart. The side of his face exposed to her gaze was black, bruised, bearded. His clothes were ragged and soiled. There were bits of alfalfa in his hair. His shoulders sagged. He made a wretched and hopeless figure sitting there. Madeline divined something of why Nels shrank from being present.|$|E
6000|$|The mansion is 10x12, with a [...] "domestic" [...] roof. Yesterday it rained--the first shower {{for five}} months. [...] "Domestic," [...] {{it appears to}} me, is not water-proof. We went outside {{to keep from getting}} wet. Dan makes the bed when it is his turn to do it--and when it is my turn, I don't, you know. The dog is not a good hunter, and he isn't worth shucks to watch--but he {{scratches}} up <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> of the cabin, and catches flies, and makes himself generally useful in the way of washing dishes. Dan gets up first in the morning and makes a fire--and I get up last and sit by it, while he cooks breakfast. We have a cold lunch at noon, and I cook supper--very much against my will. However, one must have one good meal a day, and if I were to live on Dan's abominable cookery, I should lose my appetite, you know. Dan attended Dr. Chorpenning's funeral yesterday, and he felt as though he ought to wear a white shirt--and we had a jolly good time finding such an article. We turned over all our traps, and he found one at last--but I shall always think it was suffering from yellow fever. He also found an old black coat, greasy, and wrinkled to that degree that it appeared to have been quilted at some time or other. In this gorgeous costume he attended the funeral. And when he returned, his own dog drove him away from the cabin, not recognizing him. This is true.|$|E
5000|$|Tabernacle floors {{were covered}} with sawdust to dampen the noise of {{shuffling}} feet (as well as for its pleasant smell {{and its ability to}} hold down <b>the</b> dust of <b>dirt</b> <b>floors),</b> and coming forward during the invitation became known as [...] "hitting the sawdust trail." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{center section}} of <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> and sawdust <b>floor</b> was {{replaced}} with a concrete floor in 1918, {{and at the same}} time some of the original pine benches were replaced with 586 [...] "opera chairs".|$|R

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the stage, there was an area called the pit, (or, harking back to the old inn-yards, yard) where, for a penny, people (the [...] "groundlings") would stand on the rush-strewn earthen floor to watch the performance. During the {{excavation}} of the Globe in 1989 a layer of nutshells was found, pressed into <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> <b>flooring</b> so as to form a new surface layer. Vertically around the yard were three levels of stadium-style seats, which were more expensive than standing room. A rectangular stage platform, also known as an apron stage, thrust out {{into the middle of the}} open-air yard. The stage measured approximately [...] in width, [...] in depth and was raised about [...] off the ground.
