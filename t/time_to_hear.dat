One of these concerts {{included}} the first complete performance of his First Symphony, subtitled Winter Daydreams, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version.

5|$|In November 1887, Tchaikovsky {{arrived at}} Saint Petersburg in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{several of the}} Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted {{exclusively}} {{to the music of}} Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the 'Five' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky's death.|$|E

Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and {{spent a lot of}} time together, along with Glazunov and Lyadov. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov's appointment as director of the Moscow Conservatory, this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky's visits became more frequent.|$|E

Rimsky-Korsakov, along with Alexander Glazunov, Anatol Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the Belyayev circle. This group was named after timber merchant Mitrofan Belyayev, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.|$|E

If I don't write to it right off the bat, it's not working." [...] All the songs on the album were written or co-written by Cole. Guest {{appearances}} include Amina, Nas, Monica and 2Pac. Along with the album, Cole was developing a movie based on her life. A screenwriter has develop the script with Cole in 2009.|$|R

At home, Bazarov cannot keep his mind on his work and while performing an autopsy fails to take the proper precautions. He cuts himself and contracts blood poisoning. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is.

Those crew able to get to the deck then gathered on the high starboard rail as the list continued to increase, until they all leapt into the water, followed shortly after by Captain Bell jumping from the bridge with capsize imminent. Within two minutes the Bombo had rolled over and sunk bow-first.|$|E
25|$|Trigg {{arrived on}} the second day the Fifth Congress of the United States convened, Tuesday, May 16, 1797, and was in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the new President's speech to Congress about his {{position}} in regards to France. At this time, Trigg, a Democratic-Republican/Anti-Federalist was in the minority party, as the House was majority Federalist, as was John Adams, the President of the United States. After the President's speech, which caused an uproar among Anti-Federalists as not being sympathetic enough to France and too hawkish, the House debated until May 31 on their response to his address. Their response, with an amendment, basically supported the President's speech. Trigg voted against the response, while his brother Abram voted for it.|$|E

6000|$|I {{dare say}} this was all true enough. I have always heard that the old place {{contained}} contented hearts; and contented hearts make happy faces. Kate's face was happiness itself, as {{she sat in the}} saddle listening to the crone; and my countenance is not one of ill-nature. The [...] "'Toe was ever a happy house!" [...] It recalls old <b>times,</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a house thus familiarly spoken of; for a set is rising up among us which is vastly too genteel to admit that any one--man, woman, child, or Satan, ever had a member so homely as a 'Toe.|$|R

500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting for a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from him, and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April 1827, Abbott {{was made}} Baron Tenterden, of Hendon in the County of Middlesex; having feared that [...] "Lord Abbott" [...] would leave him open to ridicule, he instead picked {{the name of}} a Kentish town near his roots. On 24 May Abbott {{formally}} took up his position, attending the House of Lords regularly, and was the last Chief Justice to wear his official robes to the Lords (other than those acting as interim Speakers). In 1830 he introduced several bills to Parliament following reports {{on the state of the}} Ecclesiastical Courts, common law courts and law of real property; all were passed, except the ecclesiastical bills, as Parliament ran out of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them. They were heard during the next Parliamentary session in 1831, and both passed; they [...] "by no means established for him the reputation of a skilful legislator... the judges have found it infinitely difficult to put a reasonable construction upon them". The Reform Act 1832 led to his departure from the Lords, and is considered to have greatly shortened his life; he fought strongly for the city corporations, which he claimed the bill treated [...] "with absolute contempt", but would be defeated. Having threatened that, should it pass, [...] "Never, never my Lords, shall I enter the doors of this House", he was true to his word, and never returned to politics, although from 8 August to 3 September 1827 he was interim Chancellor of the Exchequer, following the convention that, when vacant, the position should be held by the Lord Chief Justice.|$|E

This would make matters simpler for me for, with numbers of people going in and coming out of the castle, it would be easy to slip in unnoticed.|$|R
6000|$|And with {{memories}} of a too clear look from the girl's eyes, of a warm firm pressure from the woman's hand, Mr. Ventnor backed towards the door and passed away just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>hearing</b> in two voices: ...|$|R

2500|$|Of {{greater concern}} to Donizetti was the singers {{who were to}} be engaged. Primarily, he was {{concerned}} about the identity of the leading tenor: [...] "Until I know for sure, I cannot compose duets, finales and trios", he writes in October. By the time Donizetti arrived in Venice on 6 January 1836, the score of Belisario was almost finished, and because of delays, he had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> several of the proposed singers in a performance of Rossini's L'assedio di Corinto given on 12 January, the day before rehearsals of Belisario were to begin.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{his earlier}} {{rejection}} by the United States Navy, on his second try Rowland Brown lied about his age. (The fictitious year of birth, 1897, appears on his subsequent registration in the Navy Auxiliary Reserve and is widely given in books and web sources.) For all of his desire {{to participate in the}} war, The Official Roster of Ohio Soldiers in World War I, page 240, shows that Brown wasn't called to active duty until November 4, 1918. He had just one week of active duty, which he served at Great Lakes Naval Training Station on the shore of Lake Michigan — just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the guns of the War to End all Wars" [...] fall silent. The roster also shows that he served as a seaman second class for an additional 135 days before being released on April 27, 1919, and received an honorable discharge September 30, 1921, the cause being a [...] "lack of funds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E

Like Gone with the Wind, Kings Row concludes with the main theme hymned operatically by an unseen chorus.|$|R

2500|$|Gould's {{interest}} {{in music and}} his talent as a pianist became evident very early. Both his parents were musical, and his mother, especially, encouraged the infant Gould's early musical development. Before his birth, his mother planned for {{him to become a}} successful musician, and thus exposed him to music during her pregnancy. As a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying and wiggled his fingers as if playing chords, leading his doctor to predict that he would [...] "be either a physician or a pianist". By the age of three, Gould's perfect pitch was noticed. He learned to read music before he could read words. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould's {{interest in}} the piano proceeded side by side with an interest in composition. He would play his own little pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings, including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould house) of one of his own compositions. At the age of six, he was taken for the first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist. This left a tremendous impression. He later described the experience: ...|$|E
