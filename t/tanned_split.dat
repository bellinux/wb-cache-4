Mechanical resistance, protection against water and high temperature has to be fulfilled by leather that is intended for using in {{protective gloves}}. In this study recipes using various fatliquoring agents with different properties such as lesitin based, lanolin based, polymeric based and water proofing fat liquor were applied to produce technical glove leather and effect of each fatliquoring product on protective performance of leathers were analyzed in terms of physical and mechanical properties including tensile (ISO 3376), stitch tear (ISO 23910), tear resistance (ISO 3377 - 2), static (ISO 2417) and dynamicwater absorption (ISO 5403 - 1) and thermal stability such as dry heat (ISO 17227) and heat stability (ISO 11645). For this purpose, chromium <b>tanned</b> <b>split</b> calf leathers were used and retanning of protective leather gloves were performed by using tara and phosphonium combination. Performance testing results obtained from four different retanning processes was compared according {{to the type of}} fatliquoring material used in the production. Post-tanning with different types of fatliquoring products have significant effect on the protective performance properties of leather gloves, in terms of mechanical and thermal properties...|$|E

5000|$|... 2013: The 49th QubicaAMF Bowling World Cup visited Russia for {{the second}} time in six years, this time in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. In the women's division, [...] Caroline Lagrange, led wire-to-wire to win a second BWC title. Lagrange, who in her only other BWC {{appearance}} won the title in 2009, had a record 32 game average of 244.03 on her way to clinching the top seed for the stepladder finals after 40 games. In the finals she faced [...] Cherie Tan, who was looking to make it two straight BWC titles in the women's division for Singapore. Lagrange and <b>Tan</b> <b>split</b> the first two games. In game three Tan needed two strikes and three pins in the 10th frame to win the title. After getting the first strike, Tan left a 7 pin on her second shot and Lagrange prevailed 2-1 (242-207, 212-247, 215-213). Lagrange becomes the fifth woman (joining Jeanette Baker, Pauline Smith, Shannon Pluhowsky, Aumi Guerra) and eighth bowler overall to win multiple BWCs. In the men's division, Or Aviram, runner-up in 2005, became the first Israeli bowler to win the Bowling World Cup. As the No. 3 seed for the stepladder finals, Aviram defeated No. 2 seed [...] Alexei Parshukov 2-0 (213-171, 220-205) and in the finals he defeated No. 1 seed [...] Guy Caminsky 2-1 (279-245, 214-277, 258-182).|$|R
40|$|Depigmentary {{effect of}} 4 -tertiary butyl {{catechol}} (TBC) on UV-stimulated melanocytes on the flanks and naturally active melanocytes of ears were compared in Uscd strain hairless mice. UVB irradiation, {{twice a week}} for 1 or 2 mo, induced brown-black pigmentation on the flanks. A 1 m TBC application twice a week for 1 mo not only prevented the UV-stimulated pigmentation, but also promoted fading of the post-UV <b>tanning.</b> Dopastained <b>split</b> epidermal sheets showed {{a decrease in the}} number of melanocytes to less than one-half during the first month of TBC treatment. Melanocytes were often enlarged or lost their dendrites and both premelanosomes and melanosomes showed ultrastructural changes. However, TBC application on the ears for 1 mo showed neither color change nor a {{decrease in the number of}} melanocytes. There were ultrastrutural changes in melanocytes but the degree of abnormality was much less than those seen in UV-stimulated melanocytes. Continuation of TBC application for 2 month with the UV irradiation on the flanks or the nonirradiated ears caused an increase in the number of melanocytes. These results suggest that the initial effect of TBC may be primarily cytotoxicity to melanocytes and may correlated with their cellular functions. The stimulatory effects of TBC on melanocytes seen during the longer period of times requires further investigation...|$|R
30|$|In this analysis, the GNU General Public Licensed Weka 3.8. 1 (Frank et al. 2016) machine {{learning}} software, and specifically the J 48 decision tree algorithm, was used. The J 48 decision tree is a Java based {{implementation of the}} C 4.5 algorithm (Quinlan 1993), which uses the gain ratio measure to determine {{the value of a}} <b>split</b> (<b>Tan</b> et al. 2013). In brief, using the concept of entropy to represent the ordering of the data, this approach maximizes the difference between the resulting splits, which improves the ordering of the data, reducing the entropy (Bramer 2016). Depending on the model set up, the tree may be evaluated during or after generation, with branches that add little value removed, in a process termed pruning. The C 4.5 algorithm implements post pruning using a confidence measure of the classification error associated with each branch. If the decision node is unstable, then it {{is more likely to be}} removed during this process (Quinlan 1993).|$|R
40|$|The tannery {{industry}} is renowned for the {{huge amount of}} toxic solid and liquid waste generated from the cleaning, fleshing, <b>splitting,</b> <b>tanning,</b> shaving and buffing of raw materials. Biomass briquettes are a proven way of generating energy from waste. This study investigates the development and characterization of biomass briquettes from tannery solid wastes (TSWs). TSWs, which comprise hair, flesh, chrome shavings and buffing dust, were collected from a tannery in Kano, Nigeria, to formulate and characterize six briquettes. Scanning electron microscopy and proximate analysis were carried out on the samples. The six briquettes, comprising varying ratios of hair, flesh, chrome shavings and buffing dust, were molded and characterized. Thermal efficiency, durability and compressive strength, among other properties, were determined for the six briquette formulations. The briquettes developed had calorific values between 18. 632 and 24. 101 MJ/kg. Durability of the briquettes ranged from 98. 12 % to 99. 77 %. The energy values were {{within the range of}} 17. 462 – 24. 101 MJ/kg, which was comparable to other fuel sources such as sub-bituminous coal (20. 000 – 24. 730 MJ/kg). This study shows that TSWs can be used for fuel briquette production, which is a source of sustainable energy generation. It is environmentally friendly, cost effective and affordable compared to fossil fuel...|$|R
