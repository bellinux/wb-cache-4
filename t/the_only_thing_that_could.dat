5|$|Misaki is Asuma's {{assistant}} {{and is the}} first person that Hibiki meets from Kamisaid Magic Academy. When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E
25|$|The scarab came to Earth in El Paso, Texas, where Jaime {{picked it}} up. Not long after, Booster Gold {{appeared}} at Jaime's house to retrieve it, {{but it had}} fused itself to Jaime's spine while he was sleeping. Booster recruited Jaime for Batman's assault on the Brother Eye satellite, since the scarab was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> see the satellite. Using the scarab's powers, Jaime was able to reveal the satellite to Batman's group, enabling them to defeat it. Once Brother Eye was sent plummeting Earthward, Jaime disappeared from the ship, teleported away by the scarab, which sought to escape the Green Lanterns on board.|$|E
25|$|Babe strikes up a {{friendship}} with Bianca Montgomery during December 2003. They grow close and become best friends. At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help. She breaks into Dr. David Hayward's cabin and calls Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth. Kelly, believing a baby would be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> save her marriage, begged her brother to get her a child. Paul helps Babe get back to the cabin, where he delivers her son by the fireplace.|$|E

500|$|Marjory Stoneman Douglas {{died at the}} age of 108 on May 14, 1998. John Rothchild, {{who helped}} write her autobiography, said that her death was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> [...] "shut her up" [...] but added, [...] "The silence is terrible." [...] Carl Hiaasen eulogized her in The Miami Herald, writing that The Everglades: River of Grass was [...] "monumental", and praised her passion and her resolve; even when {{politicians}} finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a photo opportunity, she still provoked them to do more and do it faster.|$|E
500|$|With John Winchester {{making a}} demonic pact {{in the second}} season première, it was decided early on that the season would also end with another demonic pact. This {{required}} the writers to kill Sam—they felt it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> motivate Dean to sell his soul—with the pact {{becoming one of the}} driving forces behind the third season. At the same time, it opened up another new storyline by questioning if what returned was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the [...] "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started with the release of demons through the Devil's Gate {{at the end of the}} second episode. This plotline continues throughout the rest of the series, with the Winchesters attempting to hunt down the demons in the third season.|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|Widlar and Talbert {{realized}} that the founders of Fairchild {{did not intend to}} share their windfall profits with the designers. In November 1965 the two engineers accepted Peter Sprague's offer to join [...] National Semiconductor's Molectro facility in Santa Clara. Widlar received an immediate stock option of 20,000 shares, each valued at five dollars then. He refused to fill an exit interview form for Fairchild and wrote only one line (exact quote): [...] "I want to be RICH!" [...] He told Hulme that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> keep him with Fairchild was [...] "One million tax free by whatever way you choose". For unknown reasons, Robert Noyce, one of Fairchild's founders, continued to pay Widlar his salary until April 1966. According to Widlar, [...] "Maybe they did not believe that I was actually leaving. Some people are really a little slow." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by breeches buoy. [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried to drop anchor, but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke could see this effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that it was no use, they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better. [...] There was nothing else that could be done.|$|E
2500|$|Cedar {{left the}} {{protected}} harbor at Sentinel Island {{and was immediately}} blasted by the wind and blowing snow. [...] Conditions were so bad that 500 yards from the lighthouse, the station's light could not be seen and the foghorn could not be heard. [...] For 30 minutes Cedar moved slowly towards Vanderbilt Reef. [...] Green water was breaking over {{the bow of the}} Cedar. [...] Without knowing precisely where she was, the rescue ship herself was in extreme danger of running onto the reef. [...] The chief inspector of the lighthouse service district was on board Cedar at the time. [...] He conferred with Ledbetter and they agreed that with Cedar herself in danger, and nothing {{to be found in the}} conditions, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> done was to run for shelter. [...] Ledbetter turned Cedar back towards Sentinel Island. [...] Unable to see anything, he had the foghorn sounding. [...] At Sentinel Island, Captain Miller on King and Winge heard the blasts of Cedars foghorn, and sounded his own to guide them in.|$|E

2500|$|Gilman {{argued that}} women's {{contributions}} to civilization, throughout history, have been halted {{because of an}} androcentric culture. She believed that womankind was the underdeveloped half of humanity, and improvement was necessary to prevent {{the deterioration of the}} human race. Gilman believed economic independence is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> really bring freedom for women, and make them equal to men. In 1898 she published Women and Economics, a theoretical treatise which argued, among other things, that women are subjugated by men, that motherhood should not preclude a woman from working outside the home, and that housekeeping, cooking, and child care, would be professionalized. [...] "The ideal woman," [...] Gilman wrote, [...] "was not only assigned a social role that locked her into her home, but she was also expected to like it, to be cheerful and gay, smiling and good-humored." [...] When the sexual-economic relationship ceases to exist, life on the domestic front would certainly improve, as frustration in relationships often stems from the lack of social contact that the domestic wife has with the outside world.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the world}} of the , on the pre-Flashpoint Earth-40, the Superman was Zod, a {{sociopath}} banished to Phantom Zone for creating a deadly synthetic plague when he was eleven. When American scientists breached the Zone in an experiment they found Zod. [...] He feigned almost no memory of his home or his name. Renamed Clark Kent, he was sent to live with the Kents under supervision from the Pentagon, and then began running tests on his powers when they started to develop. Zod fooled most of his superiors by acting dumb, while {{at the time he was}} murdering other agents looking for a device called [...] "The Trigger", a device which could simultaneously detonate all power sources on the planet like bombs. Zod, knowing that if activated the Trigger would set off nuclear warheads, and that radiation was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> harm him, wanted the Trigger so he could destroy it. He was finally taken down by the other costumed agents, until the combined forces of the Bat and the Star were able to trap Zod in an orb of nuclear energy in space.|$|E
2500|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. Conditional Unionists objected to Lincoln's call for state quotas to suppress the rebellion, and switched from their earlier Unionist vote to secession on April 17. At the outset of the Convention, the Confederate Congress sent three commissioners to address the convened delegates {{in the first week of}} meeting. [...] Fulton Anderson warned that the Republican Party now in control of the United States government intended “the ultimate extinction of slavery and the degradation of the Southern people.” [...] Henry Lewis Benning explained that Georgia had seceded because “a separation from the North was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> prevent the abolition of her slavery.” [...] The Virginia-born John Smith Preston insisted that when the North voted for Lincoln, it decreed annihilation of white Southerners, who must act in self-defense, and Virginia should lead the Southern host in an independent Confederacy. His speech brought the Convention to a standing ovation, but only a third of the delegates were for immediate secession. [...] The Conditional Unionists awaited some overt action of aggression from Lincoln before deciding to secede.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
