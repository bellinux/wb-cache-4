Haar wavelet transform is chosen because the resulting wavelet bands are strongly correlated with the orientation elements in the GLCM computation. The second reason is because the <b>total</b> <b>pixel</b> entries for Haar wavelet transform is always minimum. Thus, the GLCM computation burden can be reduced. The proposed computation is tested with the classification performance of the Brodatz texture images.
