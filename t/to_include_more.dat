5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} at the 1924 Paris Olympics {{had given}} rugby a poor image and this, {{together with the}} problems of attracting sufficient teams to make it a viable sport and the desire <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> individual and women's events, spelled the death knell for rugby at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past at speed. Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> and much heavier guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a {{scientist}} after becoming {{a member of the}} Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> engineers.|$|E

5|$|After {{their initial}} {{founding}} with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system {{has had to}} expand several times <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's {{was in the process}} of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases them back to the farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team were able <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> cels in animations, {{as well as}} longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{began his}} career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After {{establishing}} himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, Cooper became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero—a champion of the common man—in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943).|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in January 2009. McMillen worked on level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested {{primarily}} by the pair and their families. Initially intended for release in early 2010 for personal computers and the WiiWare download service, the release date was pushed back as the design was changed <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> levels and exclude multiplayer modes. The WiiWare version was canceled due to the service's technical limitations. The music for the game was created by Danny Baranowsky, who had also composed the music for Meat Boy. The soundtrack was released as an album, and music from it was released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, the menu and wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The idea that this would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Office of Mission and Ministry, Global Outreach (GO!) operates as a cultural immersion and service program where students learn about various issues of social, economic, political, and environmental injustice while living a simple lifestyle that fosters communal and spiritual growth. Teams consist of approximately 10 students, one student leader, and one chaperone to live, work, and learn with partnering organizations. Building on the Jesuit tenets of Men and Women for Others, Magis, and Contemplatives in Action, GO! has grown over the years <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> than 30 projects throughout the United States and countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. GO!'s roots stretch back to the 1950s, when Fordham students were participating in various service and immersion projects. In the 1970s and '80s it {{became known as the}} Mexico project, with students coining the term Global Outreach in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In {{discussing}} the more lighthearted {{elements of the}} plot, such as Dr. Morris, a character who tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark elements of the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> dialogue than previous entries in the series was to ensure that this new world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may make it seem like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, {{both of whom}} he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E

5|$|Prior to SpaceChem, Zach Barth, the {{designer}} behind Zachtronics Industries, had created several Flash-based browser games with automation puzzles, including The Codex of Alchemical Engineering where the player had to place and program manipulator arms to construct atoms and molecules following {{the rules of}} alchemy. Barth had wanted to expand the ideas in Codex <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> realistic aspects of chemistry, such as more complex molecules, but did not pursue the idea immediately afterwards. About a year after completing Codex, Barth {{was inspired by the}} disused chemical plant at Gas Works Park in Seattle, giving him the idea to incorporate pipelines into the basic mechanics of molecule-building from Codex.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Reform Act 1832 {{increased}} the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> of the middle classes. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was revived. Towards {{the end of the century}} Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included William Gladstone, and the Earl of Rosebery. In the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.|$|E
5|$|With {{development}} in {{and near the}} river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, {{state and local governments}} cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{gives in}} to Kurt's urgings and wishes and {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{so they can}} spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions for posters and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides {{to run for the}} office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the character set <b>to</b> <b>include</b> <b>more</b> features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull {{with a high}} helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing a blade of medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E
