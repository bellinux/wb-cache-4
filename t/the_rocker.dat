5|$|Best {{is portrayed}} in several films about the Beatles. In the 1979 biopic Birth of the Beatles, for which Best was a {{technical}} advisor, he {{is played by}} Ryan Michael. In both the 1994 film Backbeat and in the 2000 television biopic , Best is played by Liverpool native Scot Williams. The 2008 Rainn Wilson film <b>The</b> <b>Rocker,</b> about a drummer kicked out of a glam metal band {{through no fault of}} his own, was inspired by Best's termination. Best had a cameo in the movie.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporting}} part in {{the commercially}} successful comedy Wedding Crashers (2005) improved his career prospects, but also led to him being typecast as the best friend to the main character in such comedies as Failure to Launch (2006), <b>The</b> <b>Rocker</b> (2008), and He's Just Not That Into You (2009). During this period, Cooper also continued starring in television shows, such as the 2005 sitcom Kitchen Confidential, and played a dual role in a 2006 onstage production of Three Days of Rain. However, the former was cancelled after four episodes due to low ratings. His breakthrough came {{with the role of}} a reckless teacher in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009), which became one of the highest grossing R-rated films of all time. Cooper continued to take on parts in several box office hits, including The A-Team (2010), Limitless, and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> {{finished}} 15-13 in {{the first}} WNBA season ever, missing the playoffs in 1997. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> went 20-10 and won the Eastern Conference title. However, <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> lost to <b>the</b> Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA semi-finals (before the WNBA split the playoffs by conference).|$|R
50|$|Aim√© Simard (1968 - 18 July 2003) was a Canadian {{contract}} {{killer who}} worked for the Hell's Angels, and for a Hell's Angels puppet club, called <b>the</b> <b>Rockers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> operated out of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> are known as the Nomad Chapter of the Hell's Angels.|$|R
50|$|Thomas was {{selected}} by <b>the</b> Cleveland <b>Rockers</b> with <b>the</b> No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 WNBA Draft. During her first WNBA season, she became <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> single-season rookie leader in rebounding with 164 and ranked second on <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> single-season rookie scoring list with 347 points. She started all three playoff games for <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> against Detroit, averaging 13.7 points and 7.7 rebounds in 33.3 minutes per game.|$|R
5|$|In March 2006, Cooper starred as Pip/Theo in Three Days of Rain on Broadway with Julia Roberts and Paul Rudd. This was {{followed}} by minor roles in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006) and the satirical comedy The Comebacks (2007). Cooper next appeared in the fifth season of Nip/Tuck (2007) as Aidan Stone, a television star on the fictional show Hearts 'N Scalpels. In 2008, he played the lead in Older than America, and appeared onstage in a production of Theresa Rebeck's play The Understudy at the Williamstown Theatre Festival alongside Kristen Johnston. Between his small roles of best friend to the main character in the 2008 comedies Yes Man and <b>The</b> <b>Rocker,</b> Cooper landed the lead role in the Ryuhei Kitamura-directed supernatural film The Midnight Meat Train (2008), based on Clive Barker's 1984 short story of the same name. Playing the dark character of a freelance photographer who tries to track down a serial killer was a departure from Cooper's previous comedic roles and an experience he found enjoyable. The film received positive reviews from critics, though it earned little at the box office.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. <b>The</b> <b>rocker</b> bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Herman Miller ceased {{production}} of <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> in 1968 (until they reintroduced it 30 years later), pregnant employees continued to receive these chairs as a company gift until 1984, solidifying <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> as a token of high-end nursery decor.|$|E
50|$|After the 2002 season, the Gunds {{decided to}} buy <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> from <b>the</b> WNBA, {{seemingly}} ensuring the Rockers' future. However, despite fielding competitive teams and having decent attendance for most games, the Gund family decided they {{did not wish to}} operate <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> after <b>the</b> 2003 season. No local ownership was found for the team, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> to fold. <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> ceased operation after 7 seasons, posting an all-time record of 108-112. This wouldn't happen again until 2008 when the Houston Comets ceased operations because of lack of ownership.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Detroit <b>Rockers</b> were {{an indoor}} soccer {{team in the}} National Professional Soccer League from 1990 to 2001. They played in Joe Louis Arena and Cobo Arena in {{downtown}} Detroit, Michigan as well as The Palace of Auburn Hills and Compuware Sports Arena in the suburbs. For a time, they were led by star player-coach Andy Chapman until he was lured away by the more deep-pocketed Detroit Neon in 1994. The big stars of <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> included Drago Dumbovic and goalie Bryan [...] "Goose" [...] Finnerty. <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> won <b>the</b> 1991-1992 NPSL Championship. <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> outlasted <b>the</b> home-town rival Neon only because the Neon folded with their league <b>the</b> CISL.The <b>Rockers</b> themselves finally folded in 2001 when the NPSL ceased operations. Until <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> folded, they were owned by businessmen from Walled Lake.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1987 show Barbie and <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> episode [...] "Out Of This World", Barbie and <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> sing a {{cover of}} the song as they prepare to do a concert in outer space.|$|R
25|$|When {{negative}} pressure (pushing {{down on the}} spine) {{is applied to the}} blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade's tang to the hook on rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the Tri-Ad Lock which introduces a pin in front of <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> bar to relieve stress on <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> pin, has an elongated hole around <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.|$|E
25|$|It {{became the}} jacket {{of choice for}} <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> {{generation}} and is still in production more than 40 years later.|$|E
25|$|Rocker's {{father died}} in 1877. In October 1884, <b>the</b> <b>Rocker</b> {{household}} was joined by his mother's new husband Ludwig Baumgartner. This marriage presented Rudolf with a half brother, Ernest Ludwig Heinrich Baumgartner, with whom Rocker did not maintain close contact. Rocker was shocked once again as his mother died in February 1887. After his stepfather remarried soon thereafter, Rocker was put into an orphanage.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> were {{announced}} in 1991 as successful restaurant owner Ted Gregory was granted the Arena league expansion the franchise. As {{one of four}} expansion teams for 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> sold 5,700 season tickets. Led by Art Schlichter, who had signed a one-year $40,000 contract, <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> finished their first season in the league with a surprising 7-3 record, but lost {{in the first round}} of the playoffs 41-36 to the Tampa Bay Storm.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} round of the Eastern Conference Playoffs, the Miracle had to face <b>the</b> Cleveland <b>Rockers.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> had <b>the</b> better record, the series would be played with game 1 at Orlando, game 2 at Cleveland, and game 3 (if needed) at Cleveland. The Miracle won the first game, but <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> won <b>the</b> next two and took the series.|$|R
5000|$|The Rougeaus' {{next big}} feud was against <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> in 1989. <b>The</b> feud began when <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> debuted a new theme song for {{themselves}} with them singing (this new theme was soon dropped, however). The Rougeaus claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> were [...] "copycats," [...] and hit Shawn Michaels {{in the throat}} with Jimmy Hart's megaphone. The teams feuded over the summer of 1989, producing many excellent, raved-about matches. At SummerSlam 89, the Rougeaus teamed with fellow Canadian Rick Martel, defeating <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> and Martel's former Strike Force tag-team partner Tito Santana in a six-man tag team match. After their initial feuds against the face teams of the era, the Rougeaus quickly devolved into a comedy tag team, often coming out on the short end against The Bushwhackers.|$|R
25|$|In 1956 Roadmaster had a {{shallower}} Sweepspear {{that did}} not dip {{all the way to}} <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> panel as on other models. Twin chrome strips graced the decklid with Roadmaster spelled out between them. Roadmaster script now appeared on the doors beneath the vent windows. Fender tip dual bombsights were standard. Two stator wheels were adopted as an improvement to Dynaflow. A brand new 4-door Riviera hardtop, proved to be the most popular Roadmaster, with 24,770 units sold and outselling the pillared sedan by more than two-to-one. Overall sales were 53,500. A padded dash became standard.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{government}} was showing a more indulgent attitude toward the foreign rock groups, as part of an international campaign which purpose was to achieve an opening in the commercial transactions and investments of the US and Europe in Cuba, it continued to implement an inflexible repression against any form of internal dissidence. This was the case of <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> Gorki √Åguila and his group Porno para Ricardo. In August 2008, √Åguila was arrested under charges of dangerousness, a law that allows the authorities to detain people whom they think are likely to commit crimes; even when they have not yet committed them.|$|E
25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. <b>The</b> <b>Rocker</b> series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E
50|$|The 1999 WNBA {{season was}} the 3rd for <b>the</b> Cleveland <b>Rockers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> played their worst season in {{franchise}} history, finishing dead {{last in the}} league.|$|R
5000|$|Crazy Cavan and <b>the</b> Rhythm <b>Rockers</b> (also {{known as}} Cavan & <b>The</b> Rhythm <b>Rockers,</b> Crazy Cavan [...] "N" [...] <b>The</b> Rhythm <b>Rockers,</b> Crazy Cavan & <b>The</b> Rhythm <b>Rockers)</b> are a Teddy Boy band from South Wales. The band formed in 1970, {{and is still}} {{actively}} touring and recording.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> redebuted at a WWF live {{event on}} July 7, 1988. Due to WWF {{chairman}} Vince McMahon's {{desire to have}} his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply <b>The</b> <b>Rockers.</b> <b>The</b> team proved popular with both children and women and was a mid-card stalwart of television and pay-per-view shows {{for the next two}} years. During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> were involved in the 4-on-4 Survivor Series match main event of the 1989 Survivor Series.|$|R
25|$|In 1939, Rocker had {{to undergo}} a serious {{operation}} {{and was forced to}} give up lecture tours. However, in the same year, <b>the</b> <b>Rocker</b> Publications Committee was formed by anarchists in Los Angeles to translate and publish Rockers writings. Many of his friends died around this time: Alexander Berkman in 1936, Emma Goldman in 1940, Max Nettlau in 1944; many more were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. Although Rocker had opposed his teacher Kropotkin for his support of the Allies during World War I, Rocker argued that the Allied effort in World War II was just, as it would ultimately lead to preservation of libertarian values. Although he viewed every state as a coercive apparatus designed to secure the economic exploitation of the masses, he defended democratic freedoms, which he considered a result of a desire for freedom of the enlightened public. This position was criticized by many American anarchists, who did not support any war.|$|E
500|$|In 1886 L'Estrange again {{applied to}} the Sydney City Council for {{permission}} to establish an amusement ride called [...] "The Rocker" [...] in Belmore Park. <b>The</b> <b>Rocker</b> consisted of a boat which, propelled by horsepower, {{gave the impression of}} being at sea. Permission was granted but like his juvenile pleasure grounds, {{there is no evidence that}} it was ever erected. After this, L'Estrange slipped from view in Sydney. In 1894 Edwin L'Estrange [...] "who a few years ago acquired some celebrity as the Australian Blondin" [...] appeared in court in Fitzroy, Victoria having been knocked down and run over by a horse and buggy being driven by a commercial traveller. The driver was fined and L'Estrange's injuries are not recorded.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE and her face was devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling down her face. Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands and hugging the members of the audience.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1990, Paul Roma faced Dino Bravo on WWF Superstars of Wrestling, losing after being hit with Jimmy Hart‚Äôs {{megaphone}} and then pinned. Due to the {{blow to the head}} Roma was still in the ring feeling groggy when <b>The</b> <b>Rockers</b> came out for their scheduled match. Roma got mad at <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> over coming out and was soon joined by Hercules as the two sides argued. Moments later, Roma and Hercules turned heel by attacking <b>the</b> <b>Rockers,</b> beating them down before leaving the ring together.|$|R

50|$|On February 9, 1996 <b>the</b> Chicago <b>Rockers</b> were {{evicted from}} their home arena, the UIC Pavilion, after the arena's {{management}} canceled the lease due to backed rent. According to pavilion management, <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> executives were $10,000 behind in their rent and were required to pay in advance for future games. A press release from <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> accused <b>the</b> UIC Pavilion of canceling the lease in retaliation for previously announcing {{they were looking for}} a new venue. The issue was resolved when <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> paid $108,000 in backed rent to the operators of the UIC Pavilion. They also came to an agreement to play in the venue through the rest of the season.|$|R
500|$|The McLaren‚ÄìWestwood shop {{had opened}} in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 {{to focus on}} another revival trend, <b>the</b> <b>rocker</b> look {{associated}} with Marlon Brando. As John Lydon later observed, [...] "Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto." [...] The shop would become a {{focal point of the}} punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni (who became a guitarist, songwriter and record producer), Gene October (who became the singer for the punk band Chelsea), and Mark Stewart, among many others. Jordan, the English model and actress noted for her work with Vivienne Westwood and the SEX boutique, was a wildly styled shop assistant who is credited with [...] "pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Stone {{starred in}} the comedy <b>The</b> <b>Rocker</b> (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the [...] "straight face" [...] bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role. The actress, who describes herself as [...] "a big smiler and laugher", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure. Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success. The film sees her play {{the president of a}} sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song [...] "I Know What Boys Like". Reviews for the film were generally negative, though she was praised for her supporting role, and TV Guide Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: [...] "She's positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her." ...|$|E
500|$|... "LoveGame" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in North America and Europe {{and the fourth}} single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)". In the US it was sent to Contemporary hit radio (CHR) formats for airplay from May 12, 2009. The track initially had been planned as the third single release in the United Kingdom, but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, {{it was decided that}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] would be released instead. [...] "LoveGame" [...] has received a number of remix treatments, one of which featured rocker Marilyn Manson in the vocals. Rolling Stone reported that the remix was conceived during Gaga's photoshoot with the magazine in May 2009, when Manson arrived at the set. <b>The</b> <b>rocker</b> was impressed by the shoot and wanted to collaborate with Gaga, saying that [...] "she's a great musician, she's a great singer, and she's laughing when she's doing it, the same way that I am". In return, Gaga also lent vocals for a remix of a song from Manson's seventh studio album, The High End of Low.|$|E
50|$|She was {{selected}} by <b>the</b> Cleveland <b>Rockers</b> in <b>the</b> first round (11th overall) during the annual WNBA Draft on 20 April 2001. She starred for <b>the</b> <b>Rockers</b> for three seasons.|$|R
