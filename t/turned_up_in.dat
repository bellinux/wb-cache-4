5|$|Distribution of Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{so light}} that Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1850 claimed {{it had never}} existed, noting that none had been found. The first known copy <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1859 with a second found in 1874. A type {{facsimile}} of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and introduced by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 facsimile by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.|$|E

5|$|His {{mother gave}} Scripps £200 to go {{overseas}} after his arrest. To avoid recapture, {{he used the}} birth certificate of another inmate, Simon James Davis, to get a passport in Davis' name. Within a month of his escape, he <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Mexico as John Martin. He reported to the British Embassy there {{that he had lost}} his passport, and managed to get a replacement. Martin arrived in Singapore from San Francisco at about 2a.m. SST on 8 March 1995 (6p.m. UTC on 7 March).|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} commented that {{although}} some events were sold out, {{there appeared to be}} many unoccupied seats at venues, and claimed that this was because the Ministry of Education (MOE) made a block purchase of 87,000 passes to be given to schools. However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long. The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand. The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> person at venues. To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students. On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was {{accompanying}} two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reasons for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who {{was in the midst of}} an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.|$|E

25|$|In 1885, the Buffalo Public Library's curator, James Fraser Gluck, {{approached}} Twain {{to donate}} the manuscript to the library. Twain did so.

The library successfully claimed possession and, in 1994, opened the Mark Twain Room to showcase the treasure.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{believe that}} reduced sea {{ice in the}} Northwest Passage has {{permitted}} some new species to migrate across the Arctic Ocean.

25|$|Etruscan-minted coins can be dated between 5th and 3rd centuries BC.

Roman coinage later supplanted Etruscan, but the basic Roman coin, the sesterce, {{is believed to have}} been {{based on the}} 2.5-denomination Etruscan coin. Etruscan coins have <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> caches or individually in tombs and in excavations seemingly at random, and concentrated, of course, in Etruria.|$|E
