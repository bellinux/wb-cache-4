5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 Joseph S. Clark {{was elected}} {{as the first}} Democratic mayor in 80 years. Clark filled {{administration}} positions based on merit and worked <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out corruption. Despite reforms and the Clark administration, a powerful Democratic patronage organization eventually replaced the old Republican one. Clark was succeeded by Richardson Dilworth, who continued the policies of his predecessor. Dilworth resigned {{to run for governor}} in 1962, and city council president James H. J. Tate was elected as the city's first Irish Catholic mayor. Tate was elected mayor in 1963 and reelected in 1967 despite opposition from reformers who opposed him as an organization insider.|$|E

Frustrated of his father-in-law's involvement with Pacheco, Coronel decides to work with Acosta, who informs him that his father was not corrupt, but was in fact killed while trying to expose corruptionAcosta himself was demoted for his part in working <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out corruption. When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette, who is with her lover, Boy. Coronel informs Acosta of Lulette's affair, and he attempts to use it as leverage while interrogating Mario.

5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was generally administered {{by a group}} of Whig congressmen in Washington, including Clay, who pooled their mailing lists; there were organizations in each county tasked with running the local campaign and getting out the vote. Much work was also done by the new political bosses, like Thurlow Weed of New York, who also took charge of much of the fundraising. Greeley, by then editor of the widely-circulated Harrison campaign journal, The Log Cabin, worried that the constant demands for money would drive the wealthy from politics; this did not occur. Much of the money came from those, such as land speculators, who would benefit by the internal improvements to transportation that were backed by the Whigs. Funding for local operations was expected to be raised locally, sometimes through arrangements like kickbacks from Pennsylvania canal contractors, something implemented by Thaddeus Stevens. Erie Canal workers were expected to pay a toll <b>to</b> <b>Weed</b> to finance Whig operations. Feeling that every hand was needed to defeat Van Buren, Whig leaders allowed women to help: although they could not vote, they could influence men. This {{was the first time that}} an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale.|$|E

Following the reintroduction of the litas, there was an effort <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by {{the people and the}} ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very “dollarized” as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to sudden changes in water levels, {{there are a}} number of very low bridges with an air draft of less than , which can cause problems if the water levels rise a little, and there are often no turning places at the end of the drains. Cruising can be hazardous due <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> growth, which forms a dense blanket in some channels, but a drain that was formerly virtually un-navigable may suddenly be cleared to improve its drainage performance and become navigable again. One unexpected possibility of cruising the drains is to visit New York, a hamlet just to the north of Hough Bridge on the West Fen Drain.|$|E

25|$|Finances {{probably}} {{recovered in}} the later 14th century and in the following century the abbey was fairly solvent. Revenues from particular estates were earmarked for specific purposes, generating a straightforward budget. The treasurer then had only limited discretion in spending the remainder. This system kept the abbey out of serious trouble for some decades. However, problems had set in again by 1518, when a canonical visitation by Bishop Geoffrey Blythe found debts of 1000 marks, with only 600 marks expected revenue. Blythe also criticised {{the attitude of the}} prior, the abbot's deputy, found that some canons were consorting with women of ill-repute {{and that there was no}} schoolmaster. He advised Abbot Robert Watson <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out unnecessary staff. This he did and the abbey began to recover financially in its final years.|$|E

Khánh later claimed that he had built up intelligence infrastructure <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out the Viet Cong under Diệm, but that Minh's MRC had disbanded it and released communist prisoners. Khánh was assisted by Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, who controlled the forces around Saigon, Đỗ Mậu and Nguyễn Chánh Thi.

25|$|As Chief Minister, Kamaraj {{removed the}} family {{vocation}} based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. The State made immense strides {{in education and}} trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk {{no more than three}} kilometers to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meal Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children ((The Mid-day Meal Scheme, was first introduced in 1920 by the Madras Corporation with the approval of the legislative council, as a breakfast scheme in a corporation school at Thousand Lights, Madras {{for the first time in}} the world)) Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.. He introduced free school uniforms <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> out caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds.|$|E
25|$|The Eungella National Park, {{where the}} {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented {{sections of the}} forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject <b>to</b> <b>weed</b> invasion and chytrid fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with gastric brooding frogs, were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent {{understanding of the role}} of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the temporal and spatial pattern of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog.|$|E
