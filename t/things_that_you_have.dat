2500|$|Paul Cantor, in {{his short}} text called simply Hamlet, formulates a {{compelling}} {{theory of the}} play that places the prince {{at the center of}} the Renaissance conflict between Ancient and Christian notions of heroism. Cantor says that the Renaissance signified a [...] "rebirth of classical antiquity within a Christian culture". But such a rebirth brought with it a deep contradiction: Christ's teachings of humility and meekness ("whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also") are in direct conflict with the ancient ethos that is best represented by Achilles' violent action in the Iliad ("I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done to me").|$|E

6000|$|O.--No; I cannot wait quietly: in fact I don't see any use in {{beginning}} such {{a discussion}} at all, because I am quite sure from the first, {{that you want}} to meddle with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no business with, and to interfere with healthy liberty of action in all sorts of ways; and I know that you can't propose any laws that would be of real use.[18] ...|$|E

[...] "There are many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> cut very short; and which you must, some other time, tell us fully. Your poor father would {{have reason to be}} proud of you, indeed, had he lived to see you now.

6000|$|... "But I can't {{stop right}} away, I've got to. And {{it is no}} little matter, this <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done. Is being sorry penance enough for such an act?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} know what you're talking about," [...] he said. [...] "You see, I have already taken my second bean and to me the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> spoken of seem {{altogether}} incredible. I could not bring myself to believe that an absolute return to those former horrible conditions would be possible for either you or me. By the bye," [...] he added, with a sudden change of tone, [...] "I've just {{managed to get a}} photograph of the Romney I was telling you of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he told her, [...] "we {{can look}} at things openly, and not try to persuade {{ourselves}} that they're something else. I think {{that is one of}} the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taught me. Now, suppose I haven't any expectation of the kind you mention. How does that count? Didn't you take me in when you found me lying in the snow? Isn't it practically certain that I owe my life to you? Admitting all that, is there any reason why you shouldn't permit me to offer you a trifling favour, not for your own sake, but your father's?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} taking all these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told us into grave consideration," [...] the king said, when they were seated; [...] "and have {{concluded}} {{that it will be}} for the best that this matter of these Spaniards should remain an absolute secret, and that no word shall be spoken to a single person, however dear, by any of those who have heard it. The country has long been in a disturbed state, and constant expeditions are necessary, for ourselves and for Mexico, to suppress risings, and put down outbreaks of discontent. Were the news to be whispered about that there is a strange, terrible white people within but a short distance of our shores, the result would be disastrous.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather {{think there}} is one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> forgotten," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "and which, it strikes me, is a decided {{objection}} to your plan; and that is, that the steamer for to-morrow, from New Haven, leaves at midnight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of assassins {{what shall}} {{you look for}} but assassination?

"It is a {{good and}} noble <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done," [...] said she, [...] "and I think that Heaven must <b>have</b> {{directed}} <b>you</b> to my aid, for it is scarce likely that in all Italy I should have found another man who would have done so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> will do {{perfectly}} well, my dear. Besides, many of {{the shops}} are open {{and you can get}} anything you want. As for a dress for the occasion, if you choose to fix Saturday you will have twelve days, which is twice as long as necessary. Putting aside my objection to waiting any longer I {{want to get away from}} here to some quiet place where we can forget the events of the past month, and get our nerves into working order again. If there is any reason that you can declare that you honestly believe to be true and valid of course I must give way, but if not let it be Saturday week. That is right. I see that you have nothing to urge," [...] and a fortnight later they were settled in a ch√¢let high up above the Lake of Lucerne.|$|E
60|$|II. In {{the midst}} of your zeal for the Lord, {{remember}} that the visible saint is his; and is privileged in all those spiritual <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in the word {{and live in the}} practice of, and that he is to partake thereof, according to his light therein. Quarrel not with him about things that are circumstantial; but receive him in the Lord, as becometh saints: if he will not have communion with you, the neglect is his, not yours. But saith the open profane, why cannot we be reckoned saints also? We have been christened, we go to church, we take the communion.[20] Poor people! This will not do; for so long as in life and conversation you appear to be open profane, we cannot, unless we sin, receive you into our fellowship: for by your ungodly lives you shew that you know not Christ; and while you are such by the word, you are reputed but beasts: now then judge yourselves, if it be not a strange community that consisteth of men and beasts: let beasts be with the beasts, you know yourselves do so; you receive not your horse nor your hog to your table, you put them in a room by themselves. Besides I have shewed you before, that for many reasons we cannot have communion with you.|$|E
6000|$|That the Commissaries are steeped to {{the lips}} in this horrible {{business}} has been amply shown in these paragraphs. But Mr. Sjoblom {{was able to go}} one stage further along the line which leads to the Palace at Brussels. M. Wahis, the Governor-General, a man who has played a sinister part in the country, came up the river and endeavoured to get the outspoken Swede to contradict himself, or, failing that, to intimidate him. To get at the truth or to right the wrong seems to have been the last thing in his mind, for he knew well that the wrong was essential to the system, and that without it the wheels would move more slowly and the head engineer in Europe would soon wish to know what was amiss with his rubber-producing machine. [...] "You may have seen all these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> stated," [...] said he, [...] "but nothing is proved." [...] The Commissary meanwhile had been holding a rifle to the head of witnesses so as to make sure that nothing would be proved. In spite of this Mr. Sjoblom managed to collect his evidence, and going to the Governor, asked him when he could listen to it. [...] "I don't want to hear any witnesses," [...] said he, and then: [...] "If you continue to demand investigation in these matters we will make a charge against you.... That means five years' imprisonment." ...|$|E

"Presently, Madonna," [...] he pursued, [...] "I shall {{ask you to}} tell me how it chanced <b>that,</b> <b>having</b> saved <b>you,</b> Messer Biancomonte did {{not bear}} you to your brother's house. But first I have {{business}} with my Governor of Cesena--a score which is rendered, if possible, heavier than it already stood by this <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what a {{position}} for the wife, Gwendolen!" [...] said Mrs. Gascoigne; [...] "a great responsibility indeed. But you must lose no time in writing to Mrs. Mompert, Henry. It is a good <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an engagement of marriage to offer as an excuse, else she might feel offended. She is rather a high woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Sidi, {{you may as}} {{well get}} rid of those clothes and put on the peasant's suit I bought you. I shall do the same; then should we be caught sight of, at a {{distance}}, we should simply be taken for two fellahs who have gone up into the mountains, either to shoot game or for some other purpose, while the white clothes would excite suspicion. I am sorry now that I did not get them for Hassan and Ali, but it is likely enough that I may be able to buy such things in the village. By the way, your father said, when we were riding from the Pyramids to the town, that there were a good many old tombs up in the hills. Of course, for to-night, it would be enough if we take him a short distance up, then to-morrow we can search, and if we can find one of those tombs, it will be a safe place for him to stop in; and being cut in the solid rock, it would be pleasantly cool. There will be no fear whatever of any French soldiers coming along and entering there, and we can live quietly until he is fit to sit a horse. When you have taken off those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> on, you had better tear off a number of long strips for bandages. We did what we could roughly when we first carried your father off the field; but we can bandage his wounds carefully now, and yours also must want looking to badly." ...|$|E

She will take away with her the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> worn, and will to-night cut them up and burn them, so that no trace may remain of your visit here. When she returns she will guide you through the town. At a cottage {{a quarter of a mile}} outside a muleteer with two animals is {{awaiting}} you; he does not know who you are, but believes you to be a Brazilian who has been on this side of the continent for some years, chiefly in Chili, and so speak that language, and now, being afraid to proceed by water, are about to return by the passes. How far you will be able to get him to accompany you I cannot say, but at present he has promised to take you over the Andes. The best course to take then you can talk over with the muleteer. You will find many details of the various routes in a letter Filippo has given him for you. And now adieu, se√±or. We shall think of you often, and I shall pray for your safe return to your friends. Possibly we may meet again some day, for Filippo has a powerful relation who, it is expected, may some day be the Spanish ambassador in London, and he says that he shall try and get him to take him on his staff.‚Äù ...|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} theology, {{as you are}} aware, {{it has been the}} study of the deepest heads that have come into the world--what is the nature of this stupendous universe, and what its {{relations}} to all things, as known to man, and as only known to the awful Author of it. In fact, the members of the Church keep theology in a lively condition (laughter), {{for the benefit of the}} whole population, which is the great object of our Universities. I consider it is the same now intrinsically, though very much forgotten, from many causes, and not so successful as might be wished at all. (A laugh.) It remains, however, a very curious truth, what has been said by observant people, that the main use of the Universities in the present age is that, after you have done with all your classes, the next thing is a collection of books, a great library of good books, which you proceed to study and to read. What the Universities have mainly done--what I have found the University did for me, was that it taught me to read in various languages and various sciences, so that I could go into the books that treated of these things, and try anything I wanted to make myself master of gradually, as I found it suit me. Whatever you may think of all that, the clearest and most imperative duty lies on every one of you to be assiduous in your reading; and learn to be good readers, which is, perhaps, a more difficult thing than you imagine. Learn to be discriminative in your reading--to read all kinds of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an interest in, and that you find to be really fit for what you are engaged in. Of course, at the present time, in a great deal of the reading incumbent on you you must be guided by the books recommended to you by your professors for assistance towards the prelections. And then, when you get out of the University, and go into studies of your own, you will find it very important that you have selected a field, a province in which you can study and work.|$|E

5000|$|The Spanish {{were able}} to {{complete}} their escape to Tlaxcala. There, they were given assistance and comfort, since all 440 of them were wounded, with only 20 horses left.

5000|$|The [...] "New Abuse Mix" [...] is a remixed {{version of}} the track in which the heavier, screamed layer of vocals were largely removed and {{replaced}} by a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer. The exceptions to the vocal changes lay in the final iterations of the chorus that finish out the song. Additionally, this new {{version of the}} track was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional [...] "Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you" [...] section. Selected profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; for example, the phrase [...] "...the everyday bullshit <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done" [...] was substituted with the alternative, [...] "...the everyday abusive <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done" [...] and [...] "You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart..."
