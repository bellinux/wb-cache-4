40|$|Understanding {{responses}} of forests to increasing CO 2 and temperature {{is an important}} challenge, but no easy task. Tree rings are increasingly used to study such responses. In a recent study, Van der Sleen et al. (2014) used tree rings from 12 tropical tree species and find that despite increases in intrinsic water use efficiency, no growth stimulation is observed. This challenges the idea that increasing CO 2 would stimulate growth. Unfortunately, tree ring analysis can be plagued by biases, resulting in spurious <b>growth</b> <b>trends.</b> While their study evaluated several biases, it {{does not account for}} all. In particular one bias may have seriously affected their results. Several of the species have recruitment patterns, which are not uniform, but clustered around one specific year. This results in spurious negative <b>growth</b> <b>trends</b> if <b>growth</b> rates are calculated in fixed size classes, as "fast-growing" trees reach the sampling diameter earlier compared to slow growers and thus fast growth rates tend to have earlier calendar dates. We assessed the effect of this "non-uniform age bias" on observed <b>growth</b> <b>trends</b> and find that Van der Sleen's conclusions of a lack of growth stimulation do not hold. <b>Growth</b> <b>trends</b> are -at least partially- driven by underlying recruitment or age distributions. Species with more clustered age distributions show more negative <b>growth</b> <b>trends,</b> and simulations to estimate the effect of species' age distributions show <b>growth</b> <b>trends</b> close to those observed. Re-evaluation of the growth data and correction for the bias results in significant positive <b>growth</b> <b>trends</b> of 1 - 2 % per decade for the full period, and 6 - 10 % since 1950. These observations however, should be taken cautiously as multiple biases affect these trend estimates. In all, our results highlight that tree ring studies of long-term <b>growth</b> <b>trends</b> can be strongly influenced by biases if demographic processes are not carefully accounted for...|$|R

5000|$|When supply or demand shocks {{or policy}} errors push NGDP growth {{above or below}} the target, market monetarists argue that the bank should target the level rather than {{the rate of growth}} of NGDP.
