50|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury has a {{ceremonial}} provincial curia, or court, consisting of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senior <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> his province. <b>The</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> London—the most senior cleric {{of the church}} {{with the exception of}} the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial dean, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester as chancellor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln as vice-chancellor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury as precentor, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Worcester as chaplain and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Rochester as cross-bearer.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the year}} 341 A.D., Saint Frumentius (Abune Salama Kesatie Berhan) was consecrated <b>the</b> first <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Ethiopia by <b>the</b> great Saint Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, {{who was in}} union with <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Rome.

The castle overlooks the island of Bernera.|$|E
5|$|Bloet {{was one of}} {{the chief}} {{administrative}} officers of the kingdom under William II, often associated with Ranulf Flambard, Urse d'Abetot, and Haimo the dapifer. As a bishop, he moved the newly founded monastery of Stow to Eynsham instead. This church was considered a proprietary church and <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln retained the right to appoint the abbot and installing the abbot in office. The monks of Stow had been established by his predecessor. Bloet also gave the manor of Charleton to the priory of Bermondsey, which became a Cluniac priory during Rufus' reign.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{afterwards}} became archdeacon of York and {{treasurer of}} York, sometime around 1143, probably through the patronage of William FitzHerbert {{while he was}} serving his first term as Archbishop of York. While treasurer, {{he was a member}} of the party at York that wanted to elect Hilary as archbishop after William FitzHerbert's deposition in 1147. The successful candidate was Henry Murdac, the Abbot of Fountains, who was supported by <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Durham and Carlisle, William of St. Barbara and Æthelwold respectively. Murdac excommunicated Hugh, who returned the gesture.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> modern <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Dorchester is {{an episcopal}} title used by an area <b>bishop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of England Diocese of Oxford, in the Province <b>of</b> Canterbury, England. <b>The</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Dorchester, along with <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Buckingham and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Reading, assists <b>the</b> Diocesan <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Oxford in {{overseeing}} the diocese.|$|R

5|$|In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, {{elevating}} Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that Jænberht ever recognised Hygberht as an archbishop. Canterbury retained as suffragans <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham {{were transferred}} to Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. <b>The</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{were kept}} by <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Lichfield on Bishops Fish Pool {{from the early}} 14th century. Special pens and nesting areas were constructed. Ownership of the birds passed to the Lichfield Corporation from 1548. In 1704 the lease owner of 'Swan Moggs' was {{required}} to allow the swans make their nests there. In this area today we get the street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting {{the history of the}} land use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Coventry is <b>the</b> Ordinary of the England Diocese of Coventry in the Province of Canterbury.

5|$|The Category A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) {{is one of}} {{the older}} churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the {{principal}} church for the county, administered by <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Caithness. The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined how those caught should be punished. In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.|$|E
5|$|The Condemnations at {{the medieval}} University of Paris were enacted to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing {{up a list of}} condemnations is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Gloucester {{had founded}} the Benedictine priory of StJames in 1137. In 1140 StAugustine's Abbey {{was founded by}} Robert Fitzharding, a wealthy Bristolian who had loyally {{supported}} the Earl and Matilda in the war. As a reward for this support he would later be made Lord of Berkeley. The abbey was a monastery of Augustinian canons. In 1148 the abbey church was dedicated by <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Exeter, Llandaff, and St. Asaph, and during Fitzharding's lifetime the abbey also built the chapter house and gatehouse.|$|E

John Clerk, <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Bath and Wells was strongly opposed. A majority voted for the articles, and the Convocation was prorogued.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{discussed}} with <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester and others <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester within <b>the</b> Chapter. Lambeth Palace librarian Samuel Kershaw uncovered documents in which <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester was Sub-Dean and <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Lincoln Chancellor, {{and others in}} which Winchester was Chancellor and Lincoln Vice-Chancellor. Benson ruled that <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Winchester would be Chancellor of the Province and additionally Sub-Dean only during a vacancy in the see of London (Dean of the Province).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Swedish <b>bishop</b> {{normally}} {{involved in}} the eastern campaigns was <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Linköping, not <b>the</b> <b>Bishop</b> <b>of</b> Uppsala.|$|R
5|$|Urse also {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of a new castle at the town of Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse had control of the castle after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Vix pervenit: On Usury and Other Dishonest Profit was an encyclical, {{promulgated by}} Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which {{condemned}} {{the practice of}} charging interest on loans as usury. Because the encyclical was addressed to <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Italy, it is generally not considered ex cathedra. The Holy Office applied the encyclical to {{the whole of the}} Roman Catholic Church on July 29, 1836, during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, Gisa {{supported}} William, the {{new king}} of England. He helped consecrate Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and attended the Council of Windsor in 1072 and the Council of London in 1075. At a later church council, Giso asserted his {{authority over the}} abbots of Muchelney and Athelney, but failed to uphold the same claim in regards to Thurstan, Abbot of Glastonbury. Previously, he was credited {{as the author of}} Historiola de primordiis episcopatus Somersetensis, a history of <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Wells, but he is no longer considered the author of that work.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the number}} of Spanish bishops who {{attended}} is unknown, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymund, did attend. King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend. King Stephen of England refused permission {{for any of the}} English bishops to attend, except for <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Hereford, Norwich and Chichester. It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, to quarrel with his king, after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council. Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council.|$|E
5|$|Arundel House was {{originally}} the town house of <b>the</b> <b>Bishops</b> <b>of</b> Bath and Wells. It {{was owned by}} William FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Southampton between 1539 and his death in 1542, with ownership passing to Thomas Seymour in 1545. After Seymour was executed in 1549, the property was sold to Henry FitzAlan, Earl of Arundel, and was owned by the Earldom {{for much of the}} 16th and 17th century. In 1666, it became the meeting place of the Royal Society after the Great Fire of London destroyed their previous venue. The house was demolished in 1678 and Arundel Street, adjoining the Strand, was built on the site.|$|E
5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to <b>the</b> <b>bishops</b> <b>of</b> Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
