5|$|Revolution held {{a casting}} session at a studio called The Spotlight (in Leicester Square in London), in which {{multiple}} parts were auditioned for by multiple actors. Originally, Nico was {{planned to be}} voiced by a native French speaker, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> accent; however, she ended up being voiced by Sarah Crook, a native English speaker. The rest of the credited voice actors were Alison Pettit, Andrew Secombe, Bob Golding, Jay Benedict, John Bull, Laurence Bouvard, Peter Marinker, Rachael Rogers, Rachel Preece, Simon Treves, and Seamus O'Neil.|$|E
5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his {{performance as a}} child molester in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting {{with members of the}} Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> effect {{and his eyes were}} colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself {{through a hole in the}} table and sitting perfectly still, giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E

Commonly used in the {{preparation}} of korma, ground poppy seeds, along with coconut and other spices, are combined as a paste, to be added at the last stage of cooking.

25|$|Planck {{cautiously}} {{insisted that}} this was simply {{an aspect of the}} processes of absorption and emission of radiation and {{had nothing to do with}} the physical reality of the radiation itself. In fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> answer rather than a sizable discovery. However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material. He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.|$|E

The shoot continued for two months, and became an emotional time of farewells for the cast and crew. The film has the most extensive list of re-shoots given for the trilogy. Jackson took his time to re-shoot Aragorn's coronation, rushed into a single day under second unit director Geoff Murphy on 21 December 2000.

500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you just hear one voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on [...] "When You Sleep" [...] were born out of frustration with trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> take. Shields commented that [...] "The vocals sound like that because it became boring and too destructive trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in.

Additionally, Karan had only one expectation from the contracted actors; to [...] "look good and do their job".
