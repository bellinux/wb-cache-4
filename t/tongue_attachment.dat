50|$|The {{irregular}} {{bones are}} bones which, from their peculiar form, cannot be grouped as long, short, flat or sesamoid bones. Irregular bones serve various purposes in the body, such as protection of nervous tissue (such as the vertebrae protect the spinal cord), affording multiple anchor points for skeletal muscle attachment (as with the sacrum), and maintaining pharynx and trachea support, and <b>tongue</b> <b>attachment</b> (such as the hyoid bone). They consist of cancellous tissue enclosed within {{a thin layer}} of compact bone. Irregular bones can also be used for joining all parts of the spinal column together. The spine is the place in the human body where the most irregular bones can be found. There are, in all, 33 irregular bones found here.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Rheumatoid nodules {{are common}} extra-articular {{findings}} occurring in 20 % of rheumatoid arthritis patients. They develop most commonly subcutaneously in pressure areas (elbows and finger joints) and may occasionally affect internal organs including pleura, lungs, meninges, larynx, {{and in other}} connective tissues elsewhere in the body Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 62 -year-old male who presented with a midline neck mass. Clinically it moved on swallowing and <b>tongue</b> protrusion-suggesting <b>attachment</b> to the thyrohyoid membrane. Ultrasound examination revealed a cystic lesion in the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy in a non-smoker. The neck was explored and histological examination of the excised lesion which was attached to the thyrohyoid membrane revealed a rheumatoid nodule. Conclusion A rheumatoid nodule of the thyrohyoid membrane is very rare. The triple diagnostic scheme of clinical examination supplemented with ultrasound and guided fine needle aspiration for neck lumps remains valid in most cases. If excision is indicated we feel it should be performed in such a manner that the scar tract could easily be encompassed in a neck dissection excision should definitive histological examination be adverse. We suggest that when dealing with patients with established rheumatoid arthritis one should consider a rheumatoid nodule as a differential diagnosis for any swelling on the patient whether it be subcutaneous or deep. </p...|$|R
40|$|In Pierre Robin sequence, a {{retracted}} tongue due to micrognathia {{is thought}} to physically obstruct palatal shelf elevation and thereby cause cleft palate. However, micrognathia is not always associated with palatal clefting. Here, by using the Bmp 7 -null mouse model presenting with cleft palate and severe micrognathia, we provide the first causative mechanism linking the two. In wild-type embryos, the genioglossus muscle, which mediates tongue protrusion, originates from the rostral process of Meckel's cartilage and later from the mandibular symphysis, with 2 tendons positive for Scleraxis messenger RNA. In E 13. 5 Bmp 7 -null embryos, a rostral process failed to form, and a mandibular symphysis was absent at E 17. 5. Consequently, the genioglossus muscle fibers were diverted toward the lingual surface of Meckel's cartilage and mandibles, where they attached in an aponeurosis that ectopically expressed Scleraxis. The deflection of genioglossus fibers from the anterior-posterior toward the medial-lateral axis alters their direction of contraction and necessarily compromises tongue protrusion. Since this muscle abnormality precedes palatal shelf elevation, {{it is likely to}} contribute to clefting. In contrast, embryos with a cranial mesenchyme-specific deletion of Bmp 7 (Bmp 7 :Wnt 1 -Cre) exhibited some degree of micrognathia but no cleft palate. In these embryos, a rostral process was present, indicating that mesenchyme-derived Bmp 7 is dispensable for its formation. Moreover, the genioglossus appeared normal in Bmp 7 :Wnt 1 -Cre embryos, further supporting a role of aberrant <b>tongue</b> muscle <b>attachment</b> in palatal clefting. We thus propose that in Pierre Robin sequence, palatal shelf elevation is not impaired simply by physical obstruction by the tongue but by a specific developmental defect that leads to functional changes in tongue movements...|$|R
50|$|The tube-like rostrum {{and small}} mouth opening {{restrict}} the tongue to protrusion-retraction movements. During feeding, the tongue moves {{in and out}} around 160 times per minute (nearly three times per second). According to biologist Virginia Naples, these movements are powered by the unique musculature of the giant anteater's long, large, and flexible hyoid apparatus. Conversely, biologist Karen Reiss states that the anteater's <b>tongue</b> has no <b>attachments</b> to the hyoid {{and this is what}} allows it to flick its tongue at such speeds. The animal relies on the orientation of its head for aim. When fully extended, the tongue can reach 45 cm, longer than the length of the skull. The buccinators allow it to slide back in without losing attached food and tighten the mouth to prevent food from escaping as it extends. When retracted, the tongue is held in the oropharynx by the secondary palate, preventing it from blocking respiration. This retraction is aided by the long sternoglossus muscle, which is formed by the fusion of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus, and does not attach to the hyoid. Thus, the tongue is directly anchored to the sternum.|$|R
