5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956â€“1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which would <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.|$|E

5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
25|$|I am {{satisfied}} {{that none of}} the persons whose decisions and actions I later describe ever contemplated that Kelly might <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. I am further {{satisfied that}} none of those persons was at fault in not contemplating that Kelly might <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. Whatever pressures and strains Kelly was subjected to by the decisions and actions taken in the weeks before his death, I am satisfied that no one realised or should have realised that those pressures and strains might drive him to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life or contribute to his decision to do so.|$|E
25|$|According to Judaism, Jews that voluntarily {{convert to}} Islam commit a treacherous act of heresy in abandoning the Torah. There is a view, {{held by the}} Radvaz and Ritva, that a Jew should be {{prepared}} to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life rather than convert to another religion, but the Rambam, also known as Maimonides, expresses that it is not necessary that a Jew <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life if he is forced to convert but privately follows the Torah.|$|E

25|$|Gustav I's {{breaking}} {{with the}} Catholic Church is virtually simultaneous with Henry VIII {{doing the same}} in England; both kings acted following a similar pattern, i.e., a prolonged confrontation with the Pope culminating with the king deciding to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> decisions independently of Rome.|$|E
25|$|During an uncharacteristically wild {{party in}} his Moscow hotel room, he locked {{himself in his}} bedroom and {{attempted}} suicide by cutting his wrists. Three days later, under Soviet medical care, he told his son that he felt extreme paranoia, thought that {{the walls of the}} room were moving and, overcome by a powerful sense of emptiness and depression, tried to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} his formal plea before Judge Leetham, Vernon Butts {{committed}} suicide by hanging himself with a towel in his cell. A subsequent coroner's investigation revealed Butts had unsuccessfully attempted to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life on at least four occasions prior to his arrest. His attorney, Joe Ingber, theorized that Butts' depressive state had been magnified by the impending release of transcripts of his client's testimony at the preliminary hearing, in which Butts had graphically described the torture the victims had endured prior to their murder.|$|E

25|$|Because Judaism prohibits suicide, Josephus {{reported}} that the defenders had drawn lots and killed each other in turn, {{down to the last}} man, who would be the only one to actually <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. Josephus says that Eleazar ordered his men to destroy everything except the foodstuffs to show that the defenders retained the ability to live, and so had chosen death over slavery. However, archaeological excavations have shown that storerooms which contained their provisions were also burnt, though whether this was by Romans, by Jews, or natural fire spreading is unclear.|$|E
25|$|The ages of {{the victims}} ranged from six to thirteen. According to The Washington Post, police and coroner {{accounts}} of the children's wounds differed dramatically; Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Jeffrey B. Miller said Roberts shot his victims in the head at close range, with 17 or 18 shots fired in all, including the one he used to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life as police stormed into the school by breaking through the window glass. Janice Ballenger, deputy coroner in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, counted {{at least a dozen}} shotgun pellet inflicted wounds in one child alone before asking a colleague to take over and continue for her.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, it was {{reported}} that Jean Lanfray, a Swiss farmer, murdered his family and attempted to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life after drinking absinthe. The fact that Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe was overlooked or ignored, therefore placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe. The Lanfray murders were the tipping point in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland collected more than 82,000 signatures. A referendum was subsequently held on banning the drink on 5 July 1908. After it was approved by voters, the prohibition of absinthe was then written into the Swiss constitution.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner had formed the punk rock group the Dropouts {{in the early}} 2000s merely {{as a way of}} having fun {{performing}} at shows, but after all his bandmates left for New York City to perform as the successful rock band the Stills full-time, he had an epiphany that he could <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> music more seriously, achieve that kind of success, and still have as much fun as he hoped. This, coupled with his first exposure to Tricky Woo (which he enjoyed for their resemblance to Black Sabbath and Deep Purple), led him to re-establish the Dropouts with a different musical style - hard rock - and a more earnest pursuit of success.|$|E
25|$|Constantine briefly {{transports}} {{himself to}} Hell through {{the possession of}} a familiar and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. He briefs his findings to Angela. He explains {{to her that he}} was born with the power to see {{the true nature of the}} half-breeds. He attempted suicide to escape his visions, but was saved by paramedics. However, for the sin of attempting to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life, his soul is condemned for Hell. The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible that Lucifer's son, Mammon, will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of the}} Wests' former {{friend and}} housemate, Terrence Crick, was found in his car in the Scarborough {{district}} of Hackness in January 1996. He was 48 years old. Crick had become acquainted with Fred while he had resided at the Lake House Caravan Park in 1969; he had reported Fred to the authorities on several occasions after having been shown both surgical instruments Fred claimed to have used to perform illegal abortions, and Polaroid images of the subjects' genitals {{he claimed to have}} taken immediately after the procedures, before suggesting Crick assist him in recruiting pregnant girls to perform upon. Crick had believed the information he had provided to police was ignored as Fred was a known police informant. The stress and guilt Crick had felt over the fact the information he had provided had not resulted in charges being brought apparently led him to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life; an inquest later recorded a verdict of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. His widow later submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.|$|E

25|$|Having largely {{retired from}} public life, {{he had his}} last years clouded by the 1847 death of his sole {{daughter}} from his first marriage, Fanny, duchess of Choiseul-Praslin. Fanny had married Charles, duc de Praslin, in 1825. In what {{was one of the}} most famous murders of the 19th century, the duchess had been stabbed repeatedly and with noted violence. For long before her death, Fanny had accused Charles de Choiseul-Praslin of having cheated on her and of having separated her from her children. Her killing was thought to be a consequence of the Duke's plan to run away with their children's governess. Arrested and waiting to be tried by the Court of Peers, Choiseul-Praslin was released on parole, only to commit suicide on 24 August 1847; shortly before his death, he denied all charges. This event played a part in bringing about the 1848 Revolution, after public opinion began speculating that aristocrats had allowed one of their own to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life rather than face trial, or even that Choiseul-Praslin had been allowed to escape. As a parallel result, the 1848 events brought an end to the SÃ©bastianis' influence in Corsica, especially after Tiburce SÃ©bastiani chose to retire to his domain in Olmeta-di-Tuda.|$|E
500|$|On 5 May, Sands died in {{the prison}} {{hospital}} on the sixty-sixth day of his hunger strike, prompting rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. Humphrey Atkins {{issued a statement saying}} that Sands had committed suicide [...] "under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he should die". More than 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no sympathy for his death, telling the House of Commons that [...] "Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims".|$|E
500|$|The Republic of the Congo {{received}} independence on 30 June 1960 under a joint {{government of}} Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba. The Chamber of the LÃ©opoldville parliament had convened one week prior to review Lumumba's cabinet {{and give it}} a vote of confidence. During the session, Kalonji, in his capacity as an elected deputy, criticised the proposed cabinet, expressing dissatisfaction that his party had not been consulted in its formation and declaring that he was proud not to be included in an [...] "anti-Baluba" [...] and [...] "anti-Batshoke" [...] government which had shown contempt for the wishes of Kasai's people. He also stated his intentions to encourage the Baluba and Batshoke to refrain from participating in the government and to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> steps to form a sovereign state centered in Bakwanga (currently known as Mbuji-Mayi).|$|E
