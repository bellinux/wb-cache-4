5000|$|Part of {{the success}} of the Friends of the 261 has been the {{purchase}} of numerous passenger cars for use on excursions. One that fans might recognize is the first <b>tool</b> <b>car,</b> the [...] "Earling". The car was built by the Milwaukee Road as a [...] "Beaver-tail" [...] observation in 1939, but was rebuilt into a <b>tool</b> <b>car</b> in 1959. The car was donated to the Friends in 1992, and was the main <b>tool</b> <b>car</b> until 2003. The car's age made it expensive to upgrade to Amtrak specifications, so a new <b>tool</b> <b>car,</b> [...] "Grand Canyon", was bought and repainted. Here is a list of the cars now owned by [...] "Friends of the 261". All are painted in the Milwaukee Road's famed [...] "Hiawatha" [...] orange and maroon unless otherwise noted.|$|E

50|$|While the Matchbox-branded kits {{were not}} a success, the same was not true of the AMT line. By the 1970s AMT had 20 years' {{experience}} <b>tooling</b> <b>car</b> kits, and the only difference European ownership made was a somewhat broader selection of subject matter than had been seen from them before or since. Original Matchbox model kits are highly collectable.|$|R

50|$|The St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt Route) Relief Train is a {{railroad}} rescue and recovery train, its elements now {{on display at}} the Arkansas Railroad Museum in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The train's principal feature is a large steam crane (SSW 96005), built by Industrial Brownhoist of Bay City, Michigan in 1940. Other elements of the train include a boom car, generator flat, kitchen car, <b>tool</b> <b>car,</b> and crew sleeper. The boom car, a low gondola car, was attached to the train below the projecting section of the train; the other elements of the train supported the crew and the operation of the crane to clear derailments. The relief train was assembled by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (aka the Cotton Belt Run), and remained in active service until 1996, when it was given to the museum.|$|E

5000|$|From 1908 to 1970, an almost-annual train (skipped 1924, WWII years) carried {{travelers}} between Union Station in Denver, Colorado and the Cheyenne Depot Museum. The final {{train in}} 1970 had 27 cars with 1,127 guests. Revived in 1992 for the Denver Post's 100th anniversary, the [...] "Centennial Special" [...] used Amtrak locomotives with Ski Train coaches and carried almost 800 passengers, including Colorado Governor Roy Romer and Denver Mayor Wellington Webb. In 1994, the excursion train returned as an annual event. It typically consists of Union Pacific 844, a Union Pacific water car, a helper diesel engine, a <b>tool</b> <b>car,</b> {{and as many}} as 22 passenger coaches. After Denver's Union Station renovation resulted in a greatly shortened passenger platform, the train's been based at a site near the Denver Coliseum, where it's on display the day before. Tickets for the popular trip are available by lottery and proceeds benefit the Denver Post Community Foundation.|$|E
5000|$|The museum owns {{a variety}} of {{passenger}} equipment. In 1988, the chapter {{as well as several}} members acquired five ex-New York Central Budd built 1941 stainless steel coaches from Metro-North Railroad; followed in 1990 by an additional coach, and in 1992 a baggage-rpo. Over the years, these cars were used for scenic excursions. As of 2008, they are being refurbished with new window glazing and improved heating systems. Another noteworthy car is the [...] "Pine Falls," [...] a 1939 Pullman built sleeper-lounge for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The museum also has in its collection the last car from the last train of ex-Lackawanna DC-electric MU's to depart from Hoboken Terminal in 1984. Two baggage cars are also part of the collection.

A car barn, shop and a 56 square foot brick building {{that will be}} used as a gift shop and to present photographs and historic displays. Also included in this acquisition, was a former CTA Elevated Car and a PTC Snow Sweeper. Due to the for-profit's control of the mainline, TLEW volunteers focused almost all of their effort in rehabilitating the new acquisition {{in order to make it}} a feasible work space and revenue generator. By May 10, 2014 the Museum had their first open house on property, which proved to be a success. In addition to the Museum, the TLEW has a static [...] "Museum Train" [...] located closer to Downtown Grand Rapids with Locomotives #1 and #202, a <b>tool</b> <b>car,</b> a caboose and passenger coach.

40|$|Microprocessors {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technical phenomena of the end of this century. Since twenty-five years their computing power and complexity have increased at sustained rates. Microprocessors are increasingly playing a major role in modern society. The "invisible" ones, used for controlling and monitoring machine <b>tools,</b> <b>cars,</b> aircraft, consumer electronics and other equipment are the most numerous. They are gradually changing the relationship we have with these devices. It is interesting to show that this is a "market-pull" rather than a "technology-push" phenomenon. The design of new chips thus represents a continuous challenge for the engineers and technologists striving to give the market the products it requires, and which are generally planned a long time before they actually appear.

25|$|Tim is a stereotypical American male, {{who loves}} power <b>tools,</b> <b>cars,</b> and sports. In particular, {{he is an}} avid fan of local Detroit teams. In {{numerous}} instances, Tim wears Lions, Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and {{is very much a}} cocky, overambitious, accident-prone know-it-all. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left {{at the beginning of the}} eighth season.
