Moreover, application of <b>timber</b> mill <b>waste</b> charcoal increased K concentration and reduced Mg and Mn concentrations in leaves of rubber seedlings. Therefore, application of biochar could affect nutritional status and growth of the rubber plant depending on the pH buffer capacity of the rubber growing soils and other fertilizers applied.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRapid {{growth in}} {{construction}} industry {{has increased the}} problems of construction waste around the world. In Malaysia, the construction industry {{plays a significant role}} both in the infrastructure development and economic sectors. The construction industry is been {{regarded as one of the}} major contributors of negative impact to the environment. To reduce these negative impacts, it needs a comprehensive understanding of the construction waste generation and management. Hence, the objective of this research are to identify the construction waste generation on site, to quantify the physical wastes that are generated at the construction site and to determine the construction waste management plan that have been applied in project. This research involves two ways of data collection which are by interviews and site observation. This study was conducted at three site's projects around Batu Pahat, Johor. The data collection were taken weekly in two month duration. The finding shows that, there were six types of waste produce on the three sites which are timber, metal, concrete, mortar, packaging waste and bricks. Throughout the quantifying data of the construction wastes, it shows that <b>timber</b> <b>wastes</b> were the largest contributor to the construction wastes which then followed by bricks, packaging waste and concrete. Study on construction Waste Management Plan (WMP) at sites had showed that, they were not fully applied of WMP. Hence, to minimize the waste, WMP should be fully applied on site.

They learnt of a strong demand in Japan for mechanical pulp and began to investigate production of mechanical pulp for export to Japan. It became clear that an economic pulp mill would require more wood than the company could provide from waste. This meant that cutting rights to a forest were needed, and a sawmill would be required to process the millable timber.|$|E
30|$|The {{composition}} of waste generated by each sector {{is assumed to}} be unique, and so was estimated by applying industry → product → waste concordance matrices to normalised versions of the matrices A_ 11 (the direct inputs between the intermediate sectors of the economy), and A_ 12 (the direct inputs between the intermediate sector of the economy, and the waste treatment sectors). These concorded A matrices were multiplied by total waste produced per sector to replicate the phenomenon of each product/industry having different waste types associated with its consumption and production. For example, the sectors of Forestry (sector number 35), Softwoods (36), and Hardwoods (37) are all sectors associated with Timber products, which is in turn associated with <b>Timber</b> <b>waste.</b> Each sector that has a part of its direct requirements (coefficient multiplier) attributed to Forestry (35), Softwoods (36), etc. will be assumed to produce a proportional amount of <b>timber</b> <b>waste</b> relative to the amount of timber products used in its production processes.

40|$|Utilization of Sawdust to Produce Ethanol Using Delignification Pre-treatment with White Rot Fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium Currently, Indonesia is in {{the middle}} ofpetroleum crisis. One ofthe {{alternative}} fuels which {{can be used as a}} petroleum substitute is ethanol. Ethanol can be produced from <b>timber</b> <b>waste</b> (sawdust). Indonesia in 2003 had <b>timber</b> <b>waste</b> potency of about 3 - 4 millions m 3. However, ethanol production from sawdust has problems due to its lignin content. Therefore, research on bio-delignification treatment of sawdust prior to ethanol making process is required. In the present study ethanol was produced by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using crude cellulose from Trichoderma viride and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The raw materials for ethanol production are sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria (L.)

40|$|The study investigates housing {{demolition}} and <b>timber</b> <b>waste</b> recovery – {{with the}} aim to identify ways of improving recovery. Using case studies the research focused on demolisher decision making, their onsite processes and the associated network of participants that influence timber recovery. From the data, a process model was developed that identifies and orders the drivers of demolition decision making. One aspect of the model identified the initiators of demolition and the waste created, including issues revolving around the demolition feedstock. Another aspect covers organisational business drivers and includes site safety, productivity, economies of scale, market value of waste and supply chain entrepreneurship. A third component deals with project specific drivers including the recurring cost versus income equation that impacts on the viability of project level decisions. The model includes a typology of the operational onsite response to the above drivers. Here, the deconstruction approach was found to provide high timber recovery mainly used where high-value <b>timber</b> <b>waste</b> was involved; the miscellaneous salvage approach provided some recovery of high and low-value timber; the crunch and dump approach provided low recovery or dumping at landfill and was used where low and no-value timber was involved.

There identified main negative factors affecting financial activities of permanent forest users — state forestry enterprises, which include: the lack of a mechanism of rational use of the forest resources export potential caused by the insignificant proportion of products with a high share of added value; a latent character of the mechanism for stimulating deep timber processing; underdeveloped mechanisms of regulating the flow of forest rents from the forestry to the timber processing segment of the forest-based sector. There improved theoretical and methodological approaches to diversification of forms and means of funding the development priorities of the forest-based sector, which involve raising the level of concentration of the investmentpotential of forestry and timber processing subdivisions of the territorial and forestry complex through forming integrated business associations of the holding and cluster type; separating the timber processing from forestry, which will ensure the equal level of access for timber processing businesses of different forms of ownership to unprocessed timber and will contribute to increasing the level of capitalization of forest and forestry assets; extension of the specification of forestry and forest protection activities, which will improve the efficiency of using the non-resource potential of the forest, logging <b>waste,</b> <b>timber</b> processing <b>wastes</b> and provide an increase in volumes of the funding of forestry production, including those based on public-private partnership agreements...|$|R
