5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, <b>they</b> <b>share</b> ancestral traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{affects the}} rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. <b>They</b> <b>share</b> a common tool for {{clearing}} snow, the snow plow. However, the application is different in each case—whereas roadways employ anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice, airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives to enhance traction on tracks.|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome.

5|$|As <b>they</b> <b>share</b> many {{cross-platform}} {{games and}} {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|Both WWV and WWVH {{announce}} the Coordinated Universal Time each minute, and make other recorded announcements {{of general interest}} on an hourly schedule, including the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings. Since <b>they</b> <b>share</b> frequencies, WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH, which uses a female voice. WWV time signals can also be accessed by telephone.|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which <b>they</b> <b>share</b> several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius {{are believed to have}} evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), {{as part of a larger}} adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats.|$|E
50|$|This {{class had}} two subclasses, which were mostly {{different}} in the forms, but <b>they</b> <b>shared</b> the suffix -ai- in some.

5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea <b>they</b> <b>share</b> the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E
5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that <b>they</b> <b>share</b> a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that <b>they</b> <b>share,</b> the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{all adult}} caddisflies are terrestrial, but their larvae and pupae are aquatic. <b>They</b> <b>share</b> this {{characteristic}} with several distantly-related groups, namely the dragonflies, mayflies, stoneflies, alderflies and lacewings. The ancestors {{of all these}} groups were terrestrial, with open tracheal systems, convergently evolving different types of gills for their aquatic larvae as they took to the water to avoid predation.|$|E

5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, a tradition that <b>they</b> <b>share</b> with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E

5|$|The History of Hip-Hop dance {{encompasses}} {{the people and}} events since the late 1960s that {{have contributed to the}} development of the early hip-hop dance moves, such as uprock, breaking, locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping. Black Americans and Latino Americans created uprock and breaking in New York City. Black Americans in California created locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping—collectively referred to as the funk styles. All of these dance styles are different stylistically. <b>They</b> <b>share</b> common ground in their street origins and in their improvisational nature.|$|E
