40|$|Ocean {{shipping}} of {{dry bulk}} commodities interacts {{in a market}} {{with a high degree}} of instability. According to Stopford (1997) : "Forecasting has a poor reputation in maritime circles; it is never right. " Some of the experts within the shipping theory state that dry bulk shipping charter rates are more or less unpredictable, and because of that it is extremely difficult to know when to make large investments, such as buying new ships. Are they right, or can ARIMA or ARIMAX models be able to do good forecasts of the Baltic Supramax Index (BSI) ? The BSI is a weighted average of quotations by leading broking companies around the world of <b>trip</b> <b>charter</b> rates on a number of widely traded benchmark routes. ARIMA modelling is a well-known and much-used tool for forecasting time series. In this thesis, I compare forecasts of the log of the Baltic Supramax Index using a univariate model, ARIMA(1, 1, 1); and a multivariate model, ARIMAX(1, 1, 1), with the log of the McCloskey World Steam Coal Price Index as the explanatory variable. The accuracy of the forecast of these two models did not differ significantly. The one-step ahead forecasts were quite good, but the dynamic forecast did not result in so good short-term predictions as hoped. The Baltic Supramax Index is a time series with a significant trend, especially after the dry bulk boom in 2003, and that makes the series really hard to predict. This paper can be divided into four main parts. The first part of the paper gives an introduction of the shipping market in general, Western Bulk, the dry bulk market in particular, the time series and the dry bulk boom. The second part explains the Box-Jenkins methodology and the modelling with ARIMA and ARIMAX models. The third part present the process of the model selection. The last part explains the forecasting process, followed by a comparison of the forecasts that were made from the chosen models...|$|E

50|$|Originally {{the tunnel}} had two tracks, {{electrified}} for the heavy electric passenger trains to Bristol, Rhode Island and Fall River, Massachusetts. These trains ran until 1934.

Passenger trains also ran northward to Narragansett Race Track during the racing season, this ended in the early 1950s. In the 1950s the south track was removed due to dwindling frequency of the freight trains. The ownership of the tunnel {{was transferred to the}} state of Rhode Island in 1981.

25|$|Earlier on, McGinness had met a grazier, Fergus McMaster, when McMaster's car axle {{had broken}} down on a bed in Cloncurry River. McGinness fixed the car, gaining the respect of McMaster. McGinness and Fysh headed off to Brisbane, further {{developing}} their plan along the way. Coincidentally, McMaster also went to Brisbane. Upon realising this, Fysh and McGinness, explained their airline plans to him. The initial plans for the airline service consisted of joyriding, air taxi <b>trips</b> and <b>charter</b> services spanning the Northern Territory Western Queensland region of Australia. As a result, on 20 June 1920 in Brisbane's Gresham Hotel, McGinness, Fysh, McMaster and Alan Campbell, an adviser for the Queensland Primary Producers, began to register the new airline company. The registration of the company was not finalised that day. It took several months before a name and the necessary funds were found for the business.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, a {{bus service}} was {{established}} between Oslo and Fagernes, {{reducing the number}} of annual passengers on the train line by 19,000. In 1988, the Norwegian legislature decided to shut down regular traffic on the Valdres Line while keeping the tracks between Eina and Leira open for purposes of national security. In 1989, a grassroots movement was started to keep the line, but to no avail. In 1991, the tracks between Leira and Fagernes were lifted (removed). A private company is formed to arrange <b>chartered</b> <b>trips</b> on the remaining railway.|$|R
