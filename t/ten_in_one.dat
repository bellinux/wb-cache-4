50|$|Lowe {{was born}} at Red Level, Alabama. He grew up in Ocala, Florida, {{attended}} Gulf Coast Community College and graduated from Auburn University. A right-handed pitcher (and hitter), he was listed at 6 ft tall and 185 lb during his playing career. In two seasons at Auburn, he won 23 of 26 decisions (.885) and set an Auburn Tigers record for career earned-run average (1.69) and most complete games (<b>ten)</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> season. He was selected in the 19th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft by the Cubs and compiled a won/lost mark of 24-25 with an ERA of 3.37 in 167 games over five minor-league seasons (1967-71), most {{of them at the}} Double-A level. During his final two seasons, he was a player-coach for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League.|$|E
50|$|Knowing Kaat was {{on short}} rest, manager Mele pulled him quickly. Al Worthington, Johnny Klippstein, Jim Merritt, and Jim Perry {{combined}} {{to shut out}} the Dodgers {{for the rest of}} the game. The Twins threatened again in the fifth inning when they had runners on first and second with only one out. Versailles hit a hard grounder down the third base line that appeared to be going for a double. This could have ended Koufax's day as Drysdale was warming up in the bullpen. But third baseman Jim Gilliam (who was often replaced late in games for defensive reasons) made a diving, backhanded stop and stepped on third for a force. Koufax bore down and got the third out. He ended up tossing a three-hit shutout, striking out <b>ten</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the greatest Game 7 pitching performances ever.|$|E
5000|$|Milan Crawford is an African-American man {{who accused}} Cincinnati law {{enforcement}} {{of police brutality}} following an incident in August 1996 which resulted in eighteen stitches, <b>ten</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> eye and eight in the other. The story was featured in the local newspapers, including the Cincinnati Enquirer, which provided a photograph of him taken on scene with his face covered in blood. Police said the injury {{was the result of}} Crawford resisting arrest and then having fallen face-first during a police chase. The officer who made the arrest, Timothy McGuffrey, had faced disciplinary action in 1995 for not reporting on his resume an incident from two years prior in which a black male in his custody was found to have broken ribs, among other injuries. Crawford was charged with resisting arrest and assault. The assault charge was ultimately dismissed by a grand jury, and he later defeated the charge of resisting arrest at a separate hearing. [...] The police were not held to account for their actions.|$|E

50|$|Ligety {{recorded}} his first World Cup podium {{finish in the}} first slalom of the season, at Beaver Creek in December, and followed that up with a second and a third during the next three slaloms. Ligety's first major victory of his professional career came at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, held at Sestriere. Ligety {{won the gold medal}} in the men's combined event, a major upset after the two racers favored to win the event failed to finish the slalom portion. At age 21, he became the first American man to win an Olympic gold medal in alpine skiing in a dozen years, since Tommy Moe won the downhill at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Ligety also became just the fourth American male skier to win Olympic gold, along with Moe, Phil Mahre (slalom, 1984) and Bill Johnson (downhill, 1984). At Turin, Ligety also participated in the giant slalom and the slalom, but he failed to complete either event. Following his Olympic victory in the combined, Ligety {{recorded his}} first World Cup victory, a win in the giant slalom in Yongpyeong, South Korea. He finished ninth in the overall World Cup standings for the year, marking the first time that three American men had placed in the top 10 (along with Bode Miller in third and Daron Rahlves in fourth), {{despite the fact that he}} did not compete in downhill or super-G that year. - It was a little surprise that Ted Ligety's first win was in a giant slalom because he wasn't known as a good giant slalom racer (he had only placed in the top <b>ten</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> race before, being 8th at Sölden on October 23, 2005 - and he had bib-number 18, a number which is behind the top fifteen of the world; at that time he was far better in the slalom by finishing 3rd at Beaver Creek on December, 4th, and also at Kranjska Gora on December 2005, and indeed finishing second at Adelboden on January 8). On that March 5, he was only 8th-placed after the first leg (with a deficite of 1.13 sec. behind leading Davide Simoncelli but he was able to overtake all elite racers in the second leg). - It took long until he could achieve a second win (Kranjska Gora on March 8, 2008).There is an additional note: A day before his first win there also was carried out a giant slalom at Yongpyong but he did miss; beset with jetleg, he didn't wake up in time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background As dose-escalation in {{prostate}} cancer radiotherapy improves cure rates, {{a major concern}} is rectal toxicity. We prospectively assessed an innovative approach of hydrogel injection between prostate and rectum to reduce the radiation dose to the rectum and thus side effects in dose-escalated prostate radiotherapy. Methods Acute toxicity and planning parameters were prospectively evaluated in patients with T 1 - 2 [*]N 0 [*]M 0 {{prostate cancer}} receiving dose-escalated radiotherapy after injection of a hydrogel spacer. Before and after hydrogel injection, we performed MRI scans for anatomical assessment of rectal separation. Radiotherapy was planned and administered to 78 [*]Gy in 39 fractions. Results From eleven patients scheduled for spacer injection the procedure could be performed in <b>ten.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> patient hydrodissection of the Denonvillier space was not possible. Radiation treatment planning showed low rectal doses despite dose-escalation to the target. In accordance with this, acute rectal toxicity was mild without grade 2 events and there was complete resolution within four to twelve weeks. Conclusions This prospective study suggests that hydrogel injection is feasible and may prevent rectal toxicity in dose-escalated radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Further evaluation is necessary including the definition of patients who might benefit from this approach. Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS 00003273. </p...|$|E
