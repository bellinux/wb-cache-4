5|$|Allardyce was {{appointed}} manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd's departure, who had resigned in protest at {{the sale of}} Per Frandsen as the club attempted {{to raise funds for}} the new Reebok Stadium. He inherited a talented squad, which included Eiður Guðjohnsen, Jussi Jääskeläinen, Mark Fish, Claus Jensen, Dean Holdsworth, Bo Hansen, Michael Johansen, and Ricardo Gardner. However he was forced to sell Andy Todd, son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw in a team bonding session. Despite being in the bottom half of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> he took over, Bolton reached the 1999–2000 Division One play-offs, losing to Ipswich Town, and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Aston Villa. He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play-off defeat, who he accused of being biased against Bolton. Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one year's compensation pay if he was sacked.|$|E

25|$|The club {{finished}} third in the league in 1929/30. In November 1931 they were 15th in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> they signed Dave Halliday who made an immediate impact. His goals took them up to finish 15th in the league. From 1931/32 they became a formidable FA Cup side as the only team to reach the semi-finals in all of the next three seasons. In the 1932 FA Cup semi final they lost out to last minute Cliff Bastin goal for Herbert Chapman's Arsenal. In 31/32 Halliday was City's top scorer in league and cup.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of this match was rained off, and so Glamorgan's last match of the season was {{effectively}} reduced to a three-day one. They still managed to lose, however, capping their Championship season with their fourteenth loss in sixteen matches to cement their last place in <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>When</b> the match got underway, the entire Hampshire batting order made contributions, and an innings including half-centuries from James Adams, Jono McLean, Simon Katich and Dimitri Mascarenhas, saw them {{to a total of}} 350. Australia leg spinner Shane Warne hit three sixes in a 17-minute 24, while Glamorgan captain Robert Croft snared five wickets for 103 runs.|$|E

25|$|In Korea, {{unlike in}} China, Japan and Vietnam, the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> eating from it. This {{is due to}} the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing {{communal}} side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal.|$|E
25|$|Then, in 2014, the Balearic club {{announced}} Miquel Soler as {{the coach}} {{at the beginning of}} the summer, only for new GM Dudu Aouate to remove Soler and bring in the Russian, Valeri Karpin. Under a Board led by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the Karpin-coached 2014-15 team struggled through to winter, and goalkeeper Dudu Aouate was dismissed. Then, after five consecutive victories, the Bermellone club catapulted up into the middle of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>when</b> Lorenzo Serra Ferrer sold his shares to German Utz Claassen, who then became the majority shareholder. As that shareholder, Claassen replaced Karpin with Miquel Soler, yet the team still struggled through the season and again had to salvage the season at the very end.|$|E

25|$|For each {{consonant}} in an abugida, {{there is}} an unmarked symbol representing that consonant followed by a canonical or inherent vowel. For the Ge'ez abugida, this canonical vowel is ä, the first column in the table. However, since the pharyngeal and glottal consonants of Tigrinya (and other Ethiopian Semitic languages) cannot be followed by this vowel, the symbols in the first column in the rows for those consonants are pronounced with the vowel a, exactly as in the fourth row. These redundant symbols are falling into disuse in Tigrinya and are shown with a dark gray background in <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>When</b> {{it is necessary to}} represent a consonant with no following vowel, the consonant+ə form is used (the symbol in the sixth column). For example, the word ’ǝntay 'what?' is written , literally ’ǝ-nǝ-ta-yǝ.|$|E
25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Durham {{clinched}} the County Championship on 19 September by winning their match against Nottinghamshire by eight wickets, giving them an unassailable 48.5 point lead over Yorkshire, who, the following day, completed an 80 run victory against Middlesex to secure {{second place in}} <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>When</b> Warwickshire defeated Surrey by six wickets at Edgbaston, the latter county's relegation to Division Two for 2014 was confirmed. The following week, the remaining relegation spot was taken by Derbyshire, who were also condemned to Division Two by losing a match to Warwickshire—on this occasion by an innings, after being bowled out for 103 and 120. With the prospect for relegation for both counties removed, Nottinghamshire and Somerset drew their match at Trent Bridge, while the game between Surrey and Yorkshire, whose fates had already been decided the previous week, ended as a high-scoring draw. Sussex won their final match, against champions-elect Durham, to clinch third in the standings, leaving Warwickshire and Middlesex in fourth and fifth, respectively, while Somerset and Nottinghamshire ended level on points, with the former taking sixth place, with three wins to the latter's two.|$|E
50|$|The primary keys {{within a}} {{database}} are used to define the relationships among <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>When</b> a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key in <b>the</b> other <b>table.</b> <b>When</b> each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. Most relational database designs resolve many-to-many relationships by creating an additional <b>table</b> that contains <b>the</b> PKs from both of the other entity tables—the relationship becomes an entity; <b>the</b> resolution <b>table</b> is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other <b>tables</b> is <b>the</b> second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there's seldom efficiency nor clarity in migrating {{a bunch of other}} types of columns.|$|R

25|$|In {{their first}} game after the 2017 EFL Cup Final, Southampton went ahead of Watford in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> {{they beat the}} side 4–3 at Vicarage Road on 4 March 2017. The hosts went ahead within four minutes through captain Troy Deeney, but the Saints responded and {{equalised}} 24 minutes later through Dušan Tadić following some poor defending. Nathan Redmond put the visitors ahead on the stroke of half-time, after Tadić and James Ward-Prowse worked the opportunity. Southampton pushed for a third into the second half, with Manolo Gabbiadini coming closest to scoring, but the Hornets equalised through Stefano Okaka on 79 minutes. Gabbiadini scored his sixth goal for the Saints just four minutes later and Redmond scored a fourth for Southampton, with Abdoulaye Doucouré scoring a third for Watford in stoppage time. On 19 March, Southampton lost 2–1 at Tottenham Hotspur. Christian Eriksen opened the scoring within 15 minutes {{from the edge of}} the penalty area, before Dele Alli doubled the home side's lead with a 33rd-minute penalty awarded for a foul by Steven Davis. Dušan Tadić missed a close-range chance on goal before the break, before James Ward-Prowse scored just after half-time to bring the Saints back into the game. Spurs held off further Saints attacks for the 2–1 win.|$|E
500|$|The {{recognition}} and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first {{was to leave}} gaps in <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>when</b> {{it seemed that the}} corresponding element had not yet been discovered. Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but {{he was the first to}} be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those missing elements, such as gallium and germanium. The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as tellurium and iodine, to better classify them into chemical families. Later in 1913, Henry Moseley determined experimental values of the nuclear charge or atomic number of each element, and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually corresponds to [...] the order of increasing atomic number.|$|E

Fortis obstruents, such as [...] are {{pronounced}} with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as , and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced {{at the beginning and end}} of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as [...] have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [...] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [...] or pre-glottalised [...] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [...] (see below).|$|E
