5|$|After many delays, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> and {{his party}} arrive in Honda, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has {{arranged}} for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he {{is in need of}} a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where <b>the</b> <b>General</b> claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through Delphi, the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus. Eventually, both Circe and the warrior encountered <b>the</b> <b>general,</b> who was {{revealed to be}} the warrior's uncle. <b>The</b> <b>general</b> revealed that he killed the warrior's father because he refused to join <b>the</b> <b>general.</b> Circe was then revealed to be the general's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach <b>the</b> <b>general,</b> who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests. The warrior refused, and Circe offered him with a choice; to serve <b>the</b> <b>general</b> and his men would be spared from Circe's wrath, or to kill <b>the</b> <b>general</b> and his men shall die. The Giver, who followed the two, reminded the warrior {{that if he were}} to kill <b>the</b> <b>general,</b> {{who was a member of}} his family, the oath he made to his father would be broken, yet if he killed Circe, his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken. The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men. He tricked <b>the</b> <b>general</b> into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus's blood, which killed <b>the</b> <b>general.</b> Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated. Because the warrior killed his own uncle, the oath he made to his father was broken. The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos, the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its role}} in {{establishing}} <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Synod, the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter-Lutheran organization in 1823.

In addition, many in the Ministerium were wary of a centralized organization, and the control that it might exert over individual congregations.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At the beginning of the war, <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E

5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E

5|$|General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held {{in western}} Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in {{southern}} Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). <b>The</b> <b>General</b> Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their {{goal was to}} agree on a position for <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Sejm. The competences of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), <b>the</b> <b>general</b> sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E
