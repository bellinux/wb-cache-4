40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of zinc supplement on strength and serumlipid profile on physical activity women. Method: The target population of research was all ofphysical education students in Alzahra University. 24 subjects (age= 20. 33 ± 1. 7 yrs;height= 163. 12 ± 6. 75 cm; weight= 60. 66 ± 8. 27 kg) selected randomly. Subjects completedtesting session at per week up to 8 weeks that included 1 RM <b>test</b> <b>on</b> <b>bench</b> and leg press(triceps& quadriceps strength) and blood sample analysis to determined TG; TC; LDL; HDL;and LDL/HDL. Subjects were then divided in placebo and experiment group randomly. Eitherplacebo (1 gr/d dextrose) and zn group (25 mg/d zn) to begin resistance training for 8 weeksaccording to a protocol that design by author. The collected data were analyzed by spss ver: 11 through t student (dependent & independent). Result: the results indicated that: 1 - zn supplement(25 mg/d) had non-significant effect on strength of subjects. 2 - zn supplement (25 mg/d) hadnon-significant effect on serum lipid profile in both groups. Conclusion: The findings of thisstudy indicate that using zn supplement dos not appear enhance strength and also dos not havepositive effect on serum lipid profile. According to this finding author suggested that using ofzn supplement should be under taken by physician. It is required that non significant results maybecause of amount of used the supplement; the kind of contraction recruit in the resistancetraining and the time of apply the supplement therefore these results maybe not severe andexceed investigation seem necessary...|$|E

40|$|DIRAC is a 64 channel mixed-signal readout {{integrated}} circuit designed for Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MICROMEGAS, Gas Electron Multiplier) or Resistive Plate Chambers. These detectors are foreseen as the active {{part of a}} digital hadronic calorimeter for a high energy physics experiment at the International Linear Collider.

40|$|Artificial {{perturbations}} of borehole water levels, {{known as}} slug tests, are a useful means of characterizing the glacier hydrologic system. Slug <b>tests</b> were performed <b>on</b> <b>Bench</b> Glacier, Alaska, in 21 boreholes over three field seasons {{during the transition}} from a winter to a summer drainage mode. Fifty-four slug tests were conducted, with water level monitoring in up to five boreholes adjacent to the slugged borehole. Seven of the slug tests were performed in conjunction with dye dispersion tests to identify water pathways within the slugged borehole following perturbation. Nearly 60 % of monitored adjacent boreholes showed a hydraulic connection to the slugged borehole via the glacier bed. The nature and degree of connectivity was temporally variable, suggesting that the drainage network at the bed was highly dynamic on a daily timescale and spatial scale of tens of meters. The variability of slug test responses over time and space limit the feasibility of six alternative explanations for the oscillatory water level behavior characteristic of the underdamped response.
