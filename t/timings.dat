40|$|Abstract—Magnetic {{recording}} systems employ conventional <b>timing</b> recovery to synchronize the sampler {{with the}} readback signal. However, conventional <b>timing</b> recovery does not perform well when the <b>timing</b> error is large. This paper proposes the bi-directional <b>timing</b> recovery, which utilizes conventional <b>timing</b> recovery {{to sample the}} readback signal both in forward direction and in backward direction. The outputs of these two operations are averaged {{and sent them to}} the Viterbi detector to determine the most likely input sequence.

40|$|Abstract — Traditional dynamic {{simulation}} {{with standard}} delay format (SDF) back-annotation cannot be reliably performed on large designs. The large size of SDF files makes the event-driven <b>timing</b> simulation extremely slow {{as it has}} to process an excessive number of events. In order to accelerate gate-level <b>timing</b> simulation we propose an automated fast prediction-based gate-level <b>timing</b> simulation that combines static <b>timing</b> analysis (STA) at the block level with dynamic <b>timing</b> simulation at the I/O interfaces. We demonstrate that the proposed <b>timing</b> simulation can be done earlier in the design cycle in parallel with synthesis.

This paper provides <b>timing</b> constraint recommendations, and describes how Precision translates synthesis constraints into SDC for Quartus II place-and-route optimization and <b>timing</b> analysis. Designers can customize TimeQuest reporting to view precise <b>timing</b> information about specific paths and then add constraints to correct any violations, so they can be confident the design will meet its <b>timing</b> requirements and operate as intended in the target device...|$|R

According to the technical scheme, the <b>timing</b> accuracies and dead times of original peaking <b>timing</b> and the improved constant fraction <b>timing</b> are measured. Experimental results indicate that the <b>timing</b> accuracy and the dead time of the peaking <b>timing</b> system are 18 ns and 4750 ns, the <b>timing</b> accuracy and the dead time of the constant fraction <b>timing</b> system are 0. 78 ns and 105 ns. The <b>timing</b> accuracy and the dead time of constant fraction <b>timing</b> system are significantly improved compared with those of the peaking <b>timing</b> system. In the X-ray pulsar navigation system, the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse is constructed in the two different <b>timing</b> systems through measuring the arrival time of the X-ray photon. Experimental results indicate that compared with using the peaking <b>timing</b> system, the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse using the improved constant fraction <b>timing</b> system is improved obviously, therefore, the navigation accuracy could be improved by using the constant fraction <b>timing</b> system...|$|R

5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and <b>timings.</b> His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E

On modern processors the instruction <b>timing</b> heavily depends on the processor state. WCET analysis therefore has to the model processor behavior in detail. This analysis is challenging in case of so called <b>timing</b> anomalies, which violate the continuity properties proportionality and continuity of the <b>timing</b> behavior. In this paper we present a formal definition of <b>timing</b> anomalies and a formal {{analysis of}} their impact on WCET analysis. So far, <b>timing</b> anomalies have been described {{in the composition of}} instruction sequences. We call them series <b>timing</b> anomalies. We show that <b>timing</b> anomalies are also a problem when composing the overall state of sub-states of the hardware, which we call parallel <b>timing</b> anomalies.

Our preliminary evaluation of this instrument showed that artefact-free normalization sinograms could only be obtained with a <b>timing</b> window of 10 ns or more in spite of a <b>timing</b> resolution of 3. 2 ns. This instrument uses high-speed electronics albeit with 2 -ns <b>timing</b> clock. We performed sham transmission scans with nothing in the field of view, and a range of <b>timing</b> windows from 2 to 14 ns and used a 14 -ns <b>timing</b> blank scan to generate effective attenuation sinograms as a function of <b>timing</b> window. These showed trues count-rates which fit well to a ERF @ A function. However, the effective attenuation value, which should be 1. 0, changes from block to block and becomes very high in some blocks (3. 5 at 6 ns) suggesting the need for <b>timing</b> alignment.
