50|$|<b>The</b> {{diagnosis}} of <b>anxiety</b> disorders {{is difficult because}} there are no objective biomarkers, it is based on symptoms, which typically need to be present at least six months, be more than would be expected for the situation, and decrease functioning. Several generic anxiety questionnaires can be used to detect anxiety symptoms, such as <b>the</b> State-Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory (STAI), <b>the</b> Generalized <b>Anxiety</b> Disorder 7 (GAD-7), <b>the</b> Beck <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory (BAI), <b>the</b> Zung Self-Rating <b>Anxiety</b> Scale, and <b>the</b> Taylor Manifest <b>Anxiety</b> Scale. Other questionnaires combine anxiety and depression measurement, such as <b>the</b> Hamilton <b>Anxiety</b> Rating Scale, <b>the</b> Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> and Depression Scale (HADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Examples of specific <b>anxiety</b> questionnaires include <b>the</b> Liebowitz Social <b>Anxiety</b> Scale (LSAS), <b>the</b> Social Interaction <b>Anxiety</b> Scale (SIAS), <b>the</b> Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and <b>the</b> Social <b>Anxiety</b> Questionnaire (SAQ-A30).|$|R

5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>anxieties,</b> <b>the</b> self-acceptances and the ego-identities in Japanese and Chinese college students, and to clarify the relationships among their anxieties, self-acceptances and ego-identities. The subjects were 928 Japanese college students and 866 Chinese college students. The following results were obtained: (1) Japanese college students had higher anxieties than Chinese college students. (2) <b>The</b> positive <b>anxieties</b> were higher than <b>the</b> negative <b>anxieties</b> in both Japanese and Chinese students. (3) Chinese students had higher self-acceptances than Japanese students. (4) The self-acceptances had positive correlations with <b>the</b> positive <b>anxieties</b> and negative correlations with <b>the</b> negative <b>anxieties,</b> and <b>the</b> self-denials had positive correlations with <b>the</b> negative <b>anxieties</b> in both Japanese and Chinese students. (5) About the ego-identity, there were more Japanese students in identity achievement, moratorium, or identity diffusion status than Chinese students. However, there were more Chinese students in identity achievement-foreclosure intermediate or foreclosure status than Japanese students. (6) Both Japanese and Chinese students in identity diffusion status had <b>the</b> highest negative <b>anxieties</b> and <b>the</b> lowest positive <b>anxieties.</b> And, <b>the</b> both students in identity achievement status had <b>the</b> highest positive <b>anxieties...</b>|$|R

5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce {{some of his most}} innovative and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, James Howlett, a boy {{living in}} Canada, {{witnesses}} his father {{being killed by}} groundskeeper Thomas Logan. <b>The</b> <b>anxiety</b> activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James's birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas's other son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the validity and}} reliability of <b>the</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory in screening for anxiety in older inpatients post-stroke. Design: Longitudinal Subjects: A total of 81 inpatients with stroke aged 65 years or older were recruited at four centres in England. Main measures: At phase 1 <b>the</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory and <b>the</b> Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> and Depression Scale were administered and then the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4 th edition (phase 2). <b>The</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory was repeated a median of seven days later (phase 3). Results: Internal reliability of <b>the</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory was high (α = 0. 95) and test-retest reliability acceptable (τB = 0. 53). Construct validity of <b>the</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory was evident with respect to <b>the</b> Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> and Depression Scale -Anxiety subscale (τB = 0. 61). At a cut off of 6 / 7, the sensitivity of <b>the</b> Geriatric <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory was 0. 88 and specificity 0. 84, with respect to Structured Clinical Interview diagnosis of anxiety. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -Anxiety subscale sensitivity was 0. 88, specificity 0. 54 at the optimum cut off of 5 / 6.

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
