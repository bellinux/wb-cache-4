50|$|Gummersbach {{station is}} on the Hagen-Dieringhausen railway and serves central Gummersbach in <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district. Until <b>the</b> 1980s, Dieringhausen station, which is also in Gummersbach, was more {{important}} for the city as it had a rail workshop and was a railway junction. Gummersbach station only became more important with the closing of branch lines in <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district and <b>the</b> associated loss of significance for Dieringhausen.|$|R
50|$|Rail {{services}} {{on the lines}} used by <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> Bahn along with the Eifelbahn and the Voreifelbahn were advertised in 1997 by the VRS. DB Regio NRW won the tender.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> Bahn (RB 25) is a Regionalbahn rail service running between Cologne Hansaring and Meinerzhagen in the German {{state of}} North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). It is planned that the route will be {{incorporated}} in the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn, which is operated {{as part of the}} Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{significantly}} shorten the travel time from Cologne to <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district, <b>the</b> connection between Hoffnungsthal and Overath, including the 1,087 m-long Hoffnungsthal tunnel between Hoffnungsthal and Honrath and the connection from Rosrath to Cologne, were completed in 1910. The new line used {{part of the}} Sülz Valley Railway at Hoffnungsthal to connect the two extensions together.|$|R
50|$|The Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (Rhine-Sieg Transport Association, VRS) in 1996 {{called for}} tenders to operate diesel {{services}} on the Voreifel Railway, Eifel Railway and <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> Bahn (Upper Bergian Railway) service from Cologne to Marienheide. Since June 1998, the {{line has been}} operated by DB Regio NRW with newly acquired Talent (class 644) diesel multiple units. In addition, the upgrading of the line began.|$|R
50|$|Since 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> Bahn has run in Cologne on {{the newly}} built S-Bahn trunk {{line on the}} Köln Hansaring-Cologne Hauptbahnhof-Köln Messe/Deutz-Köln Trimbornstraße route. During the {{construction}} of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway, the route was changed once again in Cologne. Shortly after Köln-Frankfurter Straße station, which opened in 2004, the line forks to Overath and via Cologne/Bonn Airport station to Troisdorf.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the station}} {{has only a}} through {{platform}} track and a platform track ending at a buffer stop. In {{the course of the}} reactivation of the Volme Valley Railway between Marienheide and Meinerzhagen, the latter will be reconnected as part of planned duplication of the line between Dieringhausen and Gummersbach. There are actually two tracks towards Dieringhausen, but one track was closed years ago and is currently separated and overgrown. New signals were also built several years ago {{in the middle of the}} second track in some places. All other tracks, including a comprehensive network of freight tracks, and facilities were demolished a few years ago, as was the former railway siding of the defunct company L. & C. Steinmüller. The site of the former railway land has been converted into a large, stretched parking area. Deutsche Bahn has not operated freight transport in <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district since 1997, except for freight traffic on the Wiehl Valley Railway, which was re-established in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The first {{documented}} written {{discussions on}} a railway through <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district {{date back to}} 1861. At that time, manufacturers founded a committee that planned a railway connection between Cologne and Kassel. This was originally {{intended to be a}} main line. This project did not materialise because the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) preferred a more northerly lines via Hagen and because of the problem of financing it—a main line would have cost 30 million gold marks. For comparison, the section from Bergneustadt to Olpe was priced at 3,367,000 marks in its building permit. The planners of the Siegburg-Olpe railway preferred a direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg. But at this time, there was still a military base in Cologne, which was {{in the way of the}} line. Another early plan proposed a line through the Agger valley from Siegburg to the Ruhr as part of the East Rhine Railway. This plan was rejected after the intervention of Cologne industrialists.|$|R
50|$|The {{double track}} line {{branches}} off the high-speed rail line north-west of the Cologne district of Gremberghoven and crosses the B8 highway (Frankfurter Straße). After the A59 autobahn underpass it swings towards {{the southeast and}} crosses farmland in a cutting. The newly established Frankfurter Strasse station connects the industrial zone of Gremberghoven and the Airport Business Park to public transport. The station is served by the S-Bahn and <b>the</b> S-Bahn-like <b>Oberbergische</b> line RB25 regional service on the Köln-Kalk-Overath railway.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, {{the still}} {{operating}} section between Overath and Cologne was completed, ending through services between Siegburg and <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district. This {{had a negative}} economic impact on Siegburg, because passengers now took the shorter, direct route to Cologne. The travel time from the Bergisches Land to Cologne was shortened to {{one and a half}} hours by the elimination of the detour via Siegburg and the old Siegburg-Overath route lost its importance. Between 1910 and 1914, the line was relaid in many places on the hillside, as there had been many fatal traffic accidents and complaints of noise pollution in the area between Osberghausen and Derschlag. Between Niedersessmar and Derschlag the old track was used by passenger and freight trams operated at lower speed by the Gummersbach Light Railways (Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen). Between Vollmerhausen and Niedersessmar the old track was completely removed. In 1913, a line was proposed to Eckenhagen. This 6.9 km long line was approved in March 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War, prevented its construction. Similarly, it was proposed in the 1920s to extend the Gummersbach Light Railways to Eckenhagen.|$|R
50|$|The Volmetalbahn is {{also the}} name of the trains running on this line as Regionalbahn service RB 52, from Lüdenscheid via Hagen to Dortmund. The Brügge-Marienheide section is not used for {{passenger}} services, but <b>the</b> RB 25 (<b>Oberbergische</b> Bahn) service runs from Marienheide to Cologne on the line.|$|R
50|$|The high reparations {{required}} by the Versailles Treaty led to a shortage of rolling stock and a limited timetable. But the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, when the French occupied the Ruhr region, meant that it became an important route for diverted coal trains. Thus the Agger Valley Railway towards Olpe along with the Wiehl Valley Railway and the Wisser Valley Railway (Wissertalbahn) and its connection to the Volme Valley Railway {{was one of the}} main lines in the new Weimar Republic for a few months. Due to the large amounts of heavy trains that ran on the line to the east, the cheaply built superstructure was damaged. The repairing of this damage took some time. In 1927, a direct service to Cologne was opened. In this case, however, the Volme Valley Railway connection to the north was preferred to running to Olpe. Express trains to the north in 1931 included a connection from Wuppertal over the Wipper Valley Railway (Wippertalbahn), the Volme Valley Railway and the Agger Valley Railway to Olpe. During the construction of Agger Valley Dam (Aggertalsperre) there was a high volume of commuters by immigrant workers to Derschlag, changing to the Gummersbach Light Railways to continue through Dümmlinghausen to Genkelmündung. A specially decorated pair of trains was operated for the transport of these workers to Derschlag, running from Cologne to Derschlag on Mondays and returning on Saturdays. During World War II, mobile guns were installed on the line in Hützemert because the east-west link again played an important role as a diversion route. From 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Oberbergische</b> district was repeatedly bombed by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Because of the stationed guns, the station and the railway depot in Dieringhausen were hit by a total of fifteen massive air raids by the end of the war. Among other things, the western half of the large entrance building and the eastern half of the roundhouse and turntable were destroyed. Part of the roundhouse was never rebuilt. The diversion route stopped because of destruction to the west by German troops under Hitler’s scorched earth policy. Among other things, the Hoffnungsthal tunnel was destroyed by German troops. All trains had to operate via Siegburg.|$|R
