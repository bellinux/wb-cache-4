50|$|Appan {{started his}} writing while Malayalam {{literature}} was slowly transiting from neo-classic socialist realism to modernism. New writings of O. V. Vijayan, M. Mukundan, Kakkanadan etc., which {{focus on the}} alienation {{of the individual and}} related anguish was unsettling to conventional critics like Joseph Mundassery, Kuttikrishna Marar etc. Their ageing literary sensibilities failed to take note of and evaluate the writings of younger generation leading to some sort of stagnation in literary criticism. Appan's entry into the Malayalam literary world at <b>this</b> juncture <b>was</b> like <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> to a closed room. Appan pointed out that the new generation writers are impatient with existing reality as they considered writing to be an attempt to create new realities. Appan justified the liberal use of myths and metaphors by the new writers. His first book Kshobhikkunnavarude Suvisesham (Gospel of the Angry) opened a new vista in Malayalam literary criticism. Soon he became the messiah of new writing in Malayalam. Liberal values and existentialist philosophy as expounded by Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus etc. found its expression in Malayalam through the genius of K. P. Appan.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} <b>this</b> paper <b>is</b> tuberculosis, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} the sanitarium movement and the efforts that were made to cure, ease and stop the spreading of the disease. The sanitarium movement was established in the late 19 th century before any effective cure for the disease had <b>been</b> found.

The paper analyses the case books for some of the patients at the sanitarium Lugnet which was situated close to the Swedish town Växjö in order to see if the treatment of the patients differed depending on gender. The result of the inquiry suggests that there were no difference in the treatment of men and women...|$|R

50|$|In 1923 {{he moved}} to J. N. Adam Memorial {{hospital}} in Perrysburg, N.Y., a tuberculosis sanitarium run by Buffalo's Public Health Department. Prior {{to the use of}} antibiotics, the primary treatment for tuberculosis <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> and sunshine. There was some evidence that sun tanning did help in the remission of the disease, but Perrysburg—40 miles south of Buffalo—had very little sunshine in the winter. Therefore, O'Brien, as a physicist on staff, developed a carbon arcs with cored carbons that very closely matched the solar spectrum. With this development the patients could have sun therapy year-round. Due to a general interest in biological effects of solar radiation, he published some of the early work on the ozone layer and erythema caused by the sun.|$|R
