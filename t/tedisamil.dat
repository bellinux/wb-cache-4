50|$|<b>Tedisamil</b> (3,7-dicyclopropylmethyl-9,9-tetramethylene-3,7-diazabicyclo-3,3,1-nonane) is an {{experimental}} class III antiarrhythmic agent currently being investigated {{for the treatment}} of atrial fibrillation. <b>Tedisamil</b> blocks multiple types of potassium channels in the heart resulting in slowed heart rate. While the effects of <b>tedisamil</b> have been demonstrated in both atrial and ventricular muscle, repolarization is prolonged more efficiently in the atria. <b>Tedisamil</b> is administered intravenously and has a half-life of approximately 8 -13 hours in circulation. <b>Tedisamil</b> is being developed as an alternative to other antiarrhythmics as incidence of additional arrhythmic events is lower compared to other class III agents. <b>Tedisamil</b> also has significant anti-ischemic properties and was initially investigated as a potential treatment for angina until its antiarrhythmic effects were discovered.Tedisamil is manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the proposed trade name Pulzium and is currently in phase III of clinical testing for atrial fibrillation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tedisamil</b> acts {{to restore}} normal {{electrical}} rhythm {{in the heart}} by prolonging the inactivation phase of the muscle. Both atrial and ventricular repolarization is lengthened by <b>tedisamil</b> by blocking multiple potassium channels including the transient outward (Ito), the adenosine triphosphate-dependent (IK-ATP), and the delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKr and IKs). <b>Tedisamil</b> action is dose dependent as currents are blocked longer and more effectively at higher concentrations. <b>Tedisamil</b> activity is greatest on Ito and acts by binding to the channel in its open configuration. This produces a blocked state and delays its inactivation. To restore normal function, <b>tedisamil</b> must unbind from the channel {{so that it can}} inactivate and eventually reopen. Similar mechanisms have been observed on the IKr and IKs currents. In both Ito and delayed rectifier channels, the <b>tedisamil</b> binding site appears to be internal as both binding and unbinding occur more effectively when <b>tedisamil</b> is applied inside the cell. <b>Tedisamil</b> also appears to provide specific, single channel blocking of IK-ATP at high concentrations. [...] As the potassium channels are responsible for restoring the resting membrane potential during an action potential, lengthening their inactivation will stop the cycle of fibrillation by preventing muscle contraction until all ion channels are available to open. Regular use of <b>tedisamil</b> will prevent further fibrillation and restore normal electrical rhythm.Tedisamil’s antiarrythmic activity also appears to be supported by inhibiting sodium currents in cardiac muscle. However this is only observed at concentrations above 20μM, concentrations 20-fold higher than required for potassium channel blocks.|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to characterize the}} effects of <b>tedisamil</b> on isolated rat cardiovascular tissues, and identify actions that could be beneficial or detrimental {{in the treatment of}} cardiac disease. Results: <b>Tedisamil</b> prolonged the Wistar Kyoto normotensive rat (WKY) left ventricular action potential and augmented the force of contraction of left ventricle strips. On the 12 -month-old SHR model of cardiac hypertrophy, the augmenting effects of <b>tedisamil</b> at 10 - 6 and 3 x 10 - 6 M were reduced. On the 21 -month-old SHR model of heart failure, the augmenting effects of <b>tedisamil</b> at 10 - 6 and 3 x 10 - 6 M were further reduced. The augmenting effect of <b>tedisamil</b> at 10 - 5 M was reduced to 47 %.

BackgroundTedisamil is a novel antiarrhythmic drug with predominantly class III activity. Its efficacy and safety for conversion of recent onset AF or AFL to NSR is not known. MethodsThis was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending dose-group trial. A total of 201 patients with symptomatic AF or AFL of 3 to 48 h duration were enrolled in a two-stage study. During stage 1, patients were randomized to receive <b>tedisamil</b> at 0. 4 mg/kg body weight or matching placebo; during stage 2, patients received <b>tedisamil</b> at 0. 6 mg/kg body weight or matching placebo. Treatments were given as single intravenous infusions. The primary study end point consisted of the percentage of patients converting to NSR for at least 60 s within 2. 5 h. ResultsOf 175 patients representing the intention-to-treat sample, conversion to NSR was observed in 41 % (25 / 61) of the <b>tedisamil</b> 0. 4 mg/kg group, 51 % (27 of 53) of the <b>tedisamil</b> 0. 6 mg/kg group, and 7 % (4 / 59) of the placebo group (p < 0. 001 for both <b>tedisamil</b> groups vs. placebo). Average time to conversion was 35 min in patients receiving <b>tedisamil.</b> There were two instances of self-terminating ventricular tachycardia: one episode of torsade de pointes and one of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, both in patients receiving 0. 6 mg/kg <b>tedisamil.</b> ConclusionsTedisamil at dosages of 0. 4 and 0. 6 mg/kg was superior to placebo in converting AF or AFL. <b>Tedisamil</b> has a rapid onset of action leading to conversion within 30 to 40 min in the majority of responders...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tedisamil</b> is a bradycardiac {{agent that}} prolongs the QT {{interval}} of the ECG and prevents cardiac arrhythmias. Given this profile, <b>tedisamil</b> {{might be expected}} to have proarrhythmic actions similar to Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. To address this question, the actions of dofetilide and <b>tedisamil</b> were examined in rabbit isolated hearts in which bradycardia was induced by AV ablation. The QT interval was prolonged in a reverse rate-dependent fashion by dofetilide (3 and 30 [*]nM) and <b>tedisamil</b> (0. 3 and 3 [*]μM). Torsades de pointes was observed in 1 / 7 hearts treated with 3 [*]nM dofetilide and 0 / 7 hearts treated with 0. 3 [*]μM <b>tedisamil.</b> The incidence of torsades de pointes was increased to 5 / 7 in hearts treated with 30 [*]nM dofetilide and to 7 / 7 in hearts treated with 3 [*]μM <b>tedisamil</b> (both P< 0. 05 vs control). The actions of 30 [*]nM dofetilide and 3 [*]μM <b>tedisamil</b> were also examined in hearts paced at 50, 100, 200 and 50 beats min− 1 successively. Both drugs caused torsades de pointes in 5 / 5 hearts paced at 50 beats min− 1; however, the incidence was reduced to 0 / 5 during pacing at 200 beats min− 1. Thus, drug-induced proarrhythmia was bradycardia-dependent. Drug-induced prolongation of the interval between the peak and end of the T-wave (QTa-e) was reverse rate-dependent and was associated with the occurrence of torsades de pointes (r= 0. 91, P< 0. 01).

To test {{the hypothesis that}} a treatment with <b>tedisamil</b> affects cardiac growth or protein phenotype, sham-operated rats and rats with ascending aorta constriction were treated with <b>tedisamil</b> (36 mg kg day− 1) for 7 weeks. Left ventricular mass and geometry, relative expression of myosin isoforms, hydroxyproline concentration and isovolumic ventricular function were assessed. Rats with aortic constriction exhibited a marked increase in left ventricular weight and the diastolic pressure–volume relationship was shifted to smaller volumes. The hydroxyproline concentration remained unaltered. The proportion of α-myosin heavy chains was, however, reduced (P< 0. 05). Hypertrophied left ventricles manifested an enhanced overall performance but depressed myocardial contractility. Administration of <b>tedisamil</b> was associated with decreased heart rate (P< 0. 05). In contrast, cardiac growth in sham-operated rats and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy of pressure-overloaded animals was not significantly altered. Hypertrophied hearts from rats treated with <b>tedisamil</b> expressed more α-myosin heavy chains (65 ± 4 versus 57 ± 4 %; P< 0. 05). Also, maximal rate of wall stress rise and decline was higher (P< 0. 05) in tedisamil-treated pressure-overloaded rats.

40|$|<b>Tedisamil</b> {{is a new}} {{antiarrhythmic}} drug with predominant class III action. The aim of {{the present}} study was to investigate the blocking pattern of the compound on the transient outward current (Ito) in human subepicardial myocytes isolated from explanted left ventricles. Using the single electrode whole cell voltage clamp technique, Ito was analysed after appropriate voltage inactivation of sodium current and block of calcium current. <b>Tedisamil</b> reduced the amplitude of peak Ito, but did not affect the amplitude of non-inactivating outward current. The drug accelerated the apparent rate of Ito inactivation. The reduction in time constant of Ito inactivation depended on drug concentration, the apparent IC 50 value was 4. 4 [*]μM. <b>Tedisamil</b> affected Ito amplitude in a use-dependent manner. After 2 [*]min at − 80 [*]mV, maximum block of Ito was reached after 4 – 5 clamp steps either at the frequency of 0. 2 or 2 [*]Hz, indicating that the block was not frequency-dependent in an experimentally relevant range. Recovery from block was very slow and proceeded with a time constant of 12. 1 ± 1. 8 [*]s. Also in the presence of drug, a fraction of channels recovered from inactivation with a similar time constant as in control myocytes (i. e. 81 ± 40 [*]ms and 51 ± 8 [*]ms, respectively, n. s.). From the onset of fractional block of Ito by <b>tedisamil</b> during the initial 60 [*]ms of a clamp step, we calculated k 1 = 9 × 106 [*]mol− 1 [*]s− 1 for the association rate constant, and k 2 = 23 [*]s− 1 for the dissociation rate constant.

Both <b>tedisamil</b> and lidocaine dose-dependently suppressed ischaemia-induced arrhythmias. The ED 50 values were 3. 0 ± 1. 3 and 4. 9 ± 0. 6 μmol kg− 1 min− 1, respectively. Combinations of the two drugs acted synergistically such that the ED 50 for <b>tedisamil</b> was reduced to 0. 8 ± 0. 2 μmol kg− 1 min− 1 {{in the presence of}} 2 μmol kg− 1 min− 1 lidocaine.

In a separate series of experiments in which normal ventricular tissue was electrically stimulated, 2 μmol kg− 1 min− 1 lidocaine produced a leftward shift in the dose–response curve for tedisamil's effect on effective refractory period (P< 0. 05). This dose of lidocaine had no effect on its own. These data indicate that the synergistic actions of combinations of <b>tedisamil</b> and lidocaine were mediated, at least in part, by extension of effective refractory period in normal myocardial tissue. In contrast to the strategy of developing drugs that are selective for a single electrophysiological mechanism, {{the results of the present}} study suggest that effective antiarrhythmic drugs might be developed by optimising the combination of two complimentary electrophysiological mechanisms (i. e., action potential-prolonging activity and inactivated state sodium channel blockade) ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the potassium channel blocker <b>tedisamil</b> versus placebo {{in the treatment of}} patients with stable angina.  DESIGN—Prospective, double blind, placebo controlled study. 203  patients first completed a seven day placebo run in. They were then randomised to receive 50  mg, 100  mg or 150  mg <b>tedisamil</b> twice daily, or placebo. Treadmill exercise testing was carried out at baseline and after 14  days of double blind treatment.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Primary efficacy parameters were an increase in total exercise duration and a reduction of the sum of ST segment depression using six ECG leads at maximum workload at trough (12  hours after last medication). Secondary aims included increase in exercise time to onset of 0. 1  mV ST segment depression, increase in exercise time to onset of any anginal pain, and reduction in ST segment depression in any of the six specified leads at maximum workload. These were all at trough. The same parameters were also assessed at peak concentrations (two hours after administration). Overall attacks of angina and the use of short acting nitrates were assessed from patient diaries.  RESULTS—Tedisamil led to a dose dependent prolongation of exercise duration (significant at all concentrations), an effect that was greater at peak than at trough. Treatment also led to a significant dose dependent reduction in the sum of ST segment depression at both trough and peak concentrations. <b>Tedisamil</b> also decreased (in a dose dependent way) the frequency of anginal attacks and the consumption of short acting nitrates, an improvement that became significant for all doses in the second treatment week. Adverse events with <b>tedisamil</b> were few. There was a pronounced rise in the incidence of diarrhoea with the 150  mg twice daily regimen. Bradycardic effects and increases in QT interval were dose dependent, but were no more evident at exercise than at rest.  CONCLUSIONS—Tedisamil, at doses of 50 - 100  mg twice daily, was found to be an effective antianginal and anti-ischaemic agent. At doses above 100  mg twice daily its main side effect, diarrhoea, becomes pronounced; therefore the  50 — 100  mg twice daily regimen appears to be appropriate.    Keywords: stable angina; potassium channel blocker; tedisami...|$|E

40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} action of the available K-channel blocking agents used to treat arrhythmias is to selectively inhibit the HERG + MIRP channels, which carry the rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (I-Kr). These antiarrhythmics, like sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide, have been classified as Class III antiarrhythmics. However, {{in addition to their}} beneficial effect, they substantially lengthen ventricular repolarization in a reverse-rate dependent manner. This latter effect, in certain situations, can result in life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Selective blockers (chromanol 29313, HMR- 1556, L- 735, 821) of the KvLQT 1 + minK channel, which carriy the slow delayed rectifier potassium current GO, were also considered to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF). However, I-Ks activates slowly and at a more positive voltage than the plateau of the action potential, therefore it remains uncertain how inhibition of this current would result in a therapeutically meaningful repolarization lengthening. The transient outward potassium current (I-to), which flows through the Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 2 channels, is relatively large in the atrial cells, which suggests that inhibition of this current may cause substantial prolongation of repolarization predominantly in the atria. Although it was reported that some antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, <b>tedisamil)</b> inhibit I-to, no specific blockers for I-to are currently available. Similarly, no specific inhibitors for the Kir 2. 1, 2. 2, 2. 3 channels, which carry the inward rectifier potassium current (I-kl), have been developed making difficult to judge the possible beneficial effects of such drugs in both ventricular arrhythmias and AF. Recently, a specific potassium channel (Kv 1. 5 channel) has been described in human atrium, which carries the ultrarapid, delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kur). The presence of this current has not been observed in the ventricular muscle, which raises the possibility that by specific inhibition of this channel, atrial repolarization can be lengthened without similar effect in the ventricle. Therefore, AF could be terminated and torsades de pointes arrhythmia avoided. Several compounds were reported to inhibit I-Kur (flecainide, <b>tedisamil,</b> perhexiline, quinidine, ambasilide, AVE 0 118), but none of them can be considered as specific for Kv 1. 5 channels. Similarly to Kv 1. 5 channels, acetylcholine activated potassium channels carry repolarizing current (I-KAch) in the atria and not in the ventricle during normal vagal tone and after parasympathetic activation. Specific blockers Of I-KAch can, therefore, also be a possible candidate to treat AF without imposing proarrhythmic risk on the ventricle. At present several compounds (amiodarone, dronedarone, aprindine, pirmenol, SD 3212) were shown to inhibit I-KAch, but none of them proved to be selective. Further research is needed to develop specific K-channel blockers, such as I-Kur and I-KAch inhibitors, and to establish their possible therapeutic value...|$|E

However, HERG-potassium channel block as an important target for class-III drugs {{has not yet been}} investigated. We investigated the effect of bertosamil on the HERG potassium channel heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Bertosamil (70 μM) inhibited HERG tail currrent after a test pulse to 30 mV by 49. 3 ± 8. 4 % (n= 5) and the IC 50 was 62. 7 μM. Onset of block was fast, i. e. 90 % of inhibition developed within 180 ± 8. 22 s (n= 5), and block was totally reversible upon washout within 294 ± 38. 7 s (n= 5). Bertosamil-induced block of HERG potassium channels was state-dependent with block mainly to open- and inactivated channels. Half-maximal activation voltage was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials. Steady-state inactivation of HERG was not influenced by bertosamil. Bertosamil block elicited voltage–but no frequency-dependent effects. In summary, bertosamil blocked the HERG potassium channel.

We have evaluated a transgenic (TG) mouse (FVB) overexpressing a dominant-negative KvLQT 1 isoform, as an in vivo screening model for I(Kr) blocking drugs. RESULTS: In TG mice, six-lead ECGs demonstrated sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation. Various drugs were injected intraperitoneally after blockade of the autonomic nervous system and serial ECGs were recorded. The end of the initial rapid phase of the T wave corrected for heart rate using a formula for mouse heart (QTrc), {{was used as a}} surrogate for the QT interval. Dofetilide, a specific I(Kr) blocker, did not prolong the QTrc interval either in TG or in wild-type (WT) mice but dose-dependently lengthened the sinus period in TG mice but not in WT mice.

In guinea pig myocytes the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kr) was largely diminished by 1 muM TED (from 0. 88 +/- 0. 17 to 0. 23 +/- 0. 07 pA/pF, n= 5, p< 0. 05), while its slow component (I-Kr) was reduced only by 5 muM TED (from 8. 1 +/- 0. 3 to 4. 23 +/- 0. 07 pA/pF, n= 5, p< 0. 05). TED did not significantly change the I-Kr and I-Kr kinetics. In rabbit myocytes 1 muM TED decreased the amplitude of the transient outward current (I-to) from 20. 3 +/- 4. 9 to 13. 9 +/- 2. 8 pA/pF (n= 5, p< 0. 05), accelerated its fast inactivation time constant from 8. 3 +/- 0. 6 to 3. 5 +/- 0. 5 ms (n= 5, p< 0. 05) and reduced the ATP-activated potassium current (I-KATP) from 38. 2 +/- 11. 8 to 18. 4 +/- 4. 7 pA/pF (activator: 50 muM cromakalim; n= 5, p< 0. 05).
