5|$|Steinitz's long lay-off {{caused some}} {{commentators}} <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Zukertort, who had scored some notable tournament victories, {{should be regarded}} as the world chess champion.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E

5|$|According to Alfonso Archi, Hidar was {{succeeded by}} Isqi-Mari whose royal seal was {{discovered}} and it depicts battle scenes, causing Archi <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that he was}} responsible for the destruction of Ebla while still a general. Just a decade after Ebla's destruction (c. 2300 BC middle chronology), Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad, Michael Astour give the date as c. 2265 BC (short chronology).|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, suggesting {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. He does not appear in Suetonius' version of the events, but this may be understandable, since his works were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian. <b>To</b> <b>suggest</b> the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.|$|E
5|$|After {{the crew}} of Apollo 10 named their {{spacecraft}} Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used {{and put in the}} news release, but the crew later decided to change them.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from suggesting a preference for meta radical-anion protonation <b>to</b> <b>suggesting</b> a mixture of ortho and meta protonation.|$|R
5|$|As {{platinum}} is {{a catalyst}} {{in the manufacture}} of the silicone rubber and gel components of several types of medical implants (breast implants, joint replacement prosthetics, artificial lumbar discs, vascular access ports, etc.), the possibility that platinum could enter the body and cause adverse effects has merited study. The Food and Drug Administration and other institutions have reviewed the issue and found no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> toxicity in vivo.|$|E
5|$|Assessment {{of motives}} {{in a medical}} setting is usually based on {{precursors}} to the incident, circumstances, and information from the patient. However, limited studies show that professional assessments tend <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments.|$|E
5|$|Balla's {{interest}} in capturing {{a single moment}} {{in a series of}} planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, more abstract works created during World War I, Balla used planes of color <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> movement.|$|E

50|$|Bokermannohyla pseudopseudis is a saxicolous species. It is a generalist, {{with the}} diet {{consists}} of various arthropods, with spiders, beetles, and cockroaches {{being the most}} important food items. There is some evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggests</b> that females are more choosy in their diet than males.|$|R
5|$|Belgrano had {{symptoms}} of syphilis, {{which he had}} caught during his time in Europe. This sickness forced him to take long leaves from {{his work in the}} Consulate, and <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> his cousin Juan José Castelli, who had similar ideas, as a possible replacement during his leaves. Rejection by the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796.|$|E
5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms. There is no evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that any Ireland Kings of Arms ever attempted to exercise control over the heraldic practice of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Cast shadows {{give away}} even well-camouflaged animals. Many animals {{therefore}} {{take care to}} minimise shadow, by lying down, with flattened bodies, or with fringes. Some hawkmoth caterpillars have false shadow patterns <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> they are parts of other objects.|$|E

5|$|Disliking Royal Doulton's tiling designs, {{and with}} her time and money {{increasingly}} devoted {{to the maintenance of}} the Watts Gallery, Mary Watts by now was losing interest in the memorial and by 1930 had handed complete control to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee. Neither Mary Watts nor the Committee had added new names to the list originally proposed by Watts, and thus there were no proposed names more recent than 1904, with the vast majority dating back to the 19th century. The Committee decided that rather than use these by now dated records, they would request suggestions from relevant public bodies. The British Medical Association was asked <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> brave medical professionals, the Metropolitan Police Service <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> brave police officers, and, in light of the park's name, the General Post Office was asked <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> heroic postal workers. The Metropolitan Police suggested the names of three officers who had died while rescuing others, and on 15 October 1930 tablets to the three officers, manufactured by Royal Doulton to a similar design to their previous tablets, were added to the second row and unveiled by Hastings Lees-Smith, the Postmaster-General, in a ceremony also commemorating the 50th anniversary of the opening of the park, attended by Mary Watts and many police officers and relatives of those being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{community}} tried several names, rejecting Albion, All Saints, Lowell, Brooklyn, Addiseville and Winona. The twenty four small lakes that are now within the city limits led Charles Hoag, Minneapolis's first schoolmaster, <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> Minnehapolis, derived from Minnehaha and mni, the Dakota word for water, and polis, the Greek word for city.|$|E

5|$|Elective safeties {{are more}} common in Canadian football, where they can result in better field {{position}} than a punt. The 2010 Edmonton Eskimos surrendered a Canadian Football League (CFL)-record 14 safeties, a factor that led CFL reporter Jim Mullin <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> increasing {{the value of the}} safety touch from two to three points as a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> they have been separated for millions of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E
5|$|H3 and H6 do {{not share}} such a convincing suite of Heinrich event {{symptoms}} as events H1, H2, H4, and H5, which has led some researchers <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that they are not}} true Heinrich events. That would make Gerard C. Bond's suggestion of Heinrich events fitting into a 7,000-year cycle ("Bond events") suspect.|$|E

50|$|In earlier {{literature}} the belvica has variously {{been treated}} as belonging <b>to</b> <b>suggested</b> endemic genera Acantholingua and Salmothymus. Genetic studies however indicate {{it is a good}} member of the Salmo genus, and closest to the softmouth trout Salmo obtusirostris.
