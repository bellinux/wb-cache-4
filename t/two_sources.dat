5|$|The {{events of}} the conquest are narrated by <b>two</b> <b>sources,</b> the various {{versions}} of the Chronicle of the Morea, and On the Conquest of Constantinople, by the Crusader Geoffrey of Villehardouin (uncle of Geoffrey I). According to the Chronicle, the Franks had between 700 men, while the Greeks had 4,000, mounted and on foot. The elder Villehardouin states that the army of Michael (who is not mentioned by the Chronicle) numbered 5,000 men {{and that of the}} Franks 500. The <b>two</b> <b>sources</b> also differ in the exact chronology of events, with the Chronicle placing the battle after the Frankish capture of Kalamata, and the elder Villehardouin after the seizure of Modon. In any case, despite being outnumbered, the Franks, after a march of a single day, confronted the Greeks and won the battle, no details for which are given.|$|E
40|$|A Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation (TTCM) aided {{superposition}} {{modulation scheme}} is conceived for a Decode-and-Forward (DAF) based cooperative communication system. More specifically, <b>two</b> <b>source</b> nodes communicate simultaneously {{with the same}} destination node via a relay node. Superposition modulation is invoked at the relay node in order to combine and simultaneously transmit the <b>two</b> <b>source</b> signals to the destination node. Hence two timeslots are used to transmit <b>two</b> <b>source</b> signals. Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts and power sharing techniques are employed in our design.

5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library.

Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from <b>two</b> <b>sources</b> to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first strategy was to take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E

Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.|$|E

40|$|Current-generation {{microprocessors}} {{are designed}} to process instructions with one and <b>two</b> <b>source</b> operands at equal cost. Handling <b>two</b> <b>source</b> operands requires multiple ports for each instruction in structures [...] such as the register file and wakeup logic [...] which are often in the processor critical timing paths. We argue that these structures are overdesigned since {{only a small fraction}} of instructions require <b>two</b> <b>source</b> operands to be processed simultaneously. [n this paper, we propose the half-price architecture that judiciously removes this overdesign by restricting the processor capability to handle <b>two</b> <b>source</b> operands in certain timing-critical cases. Two techniques are proposed and evaluated: one for the wakeup logic is sequential wakeup, which decouples half of the tag matching logic from the wakeup bus to reduce the load capacitance of the bus. The other technique for the register file is sequential register access, which halves the register read ports by sequentially accessing two values using a single port when needed. We show that a pipeline that optimizes scheduling and register access for a single operand achieves nearly the same performance as an ideal base machine that fully handles two operands, with 2. 2 % (worst case 4. 8 %) IPC degradation...|$|R

The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from <b>two</b> <b>sources,</b> the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town.

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the <b>two</b> <b>sources</b> complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E

5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter <b>two</b> <b>sources</b> specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of Dublin. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were {{put up in}} most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from <b>two</b> <b>sources</b> via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
