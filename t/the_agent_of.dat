5|$|In 1514, Gigli (as <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> Wolsey and Henry VIII) {{arranged}} for another cardinal-nephew Giulio de'Medici (future Pope Clement VII) to be cardinal protector of England. Medici's {{letter of appointment}} makes no reference to Sisto della Rovere. A 8 February 1514 letter from Pope Leo X to Henry VIII of England flatters the king for having elevated the pope's cardinal-nephew and cousin as protector. The pope's brother Giuliano de' Medici was also made a Knight of the Garter (just as Guidobaldo II della Rovere had been made when della Rovere had been made protector).|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Often blamed {{by those}} who deemed the act a crime was British {{financial}} writer Ernest Seyd, who had given advice as to {{the text of the}} bill, as attested by Congressman Hooper on the House floor in 1872. Seyd, according to this theory, was <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> a group of British holders of American bonds, who had sent Seyd to America with ₤100,000 (then about $550,000) to bribe congressmen into demonetizing silver. Kelley denied this had taken place, but the story stuck, and became a common belief in the silver movement. In 1890, Seyd's corrupt involvement was asserted {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives by Arkansas's Thomas C. McRae. Seyd was in fact an ardent bimetallist who strongly objected to the American demonetization of silver. He had submitted, at Hooper's request, an analysis of the bill in the course of which he advocated retaining the silver dollar as a legal tender.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus {{found himself in a}} {{difficult}} position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|While on Müller's trail, {{he happens}} to meet his old friend, the Portuguese {{merchant}} Oliveira da Figueira. With Figueira's help, Tintin enters Müller's house and knocks the criminal unconscious. He finds the prince, who is imprisoned in a dungeon, and rescues him as Haddock arrives with the authorities. Müller is revealed to be <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> <b>of</b> a foreign power responsible for the tampering of the fuel supplies, having invented a type of chemical in tablet form, which {{goes by the name}} Formula 14, that increases the explosive power of oil by a significant amount. Thomson and Thompson find the tablets and swallow them, thinking them to be aspirin, causing them to grow long hair and beards that change colour. After analysing the tablets, Professor Calculus develops an antidote for Thomson and Thompson and a means of countering the affected oil supplies.|$|E
