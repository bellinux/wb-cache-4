5|$|McGinnity {{finished}} his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons. He had nearly 500 professional wins including {{his years in}} the minor leagues. McGinnity set a career record in batters hit by pitch with 152. He revolutionized the fielding of <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> position, by attempting to make force outs at any base, instead of only throwing the ball to first base.|$|E
5|$|Connie Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912. After using Pennock sparingly, and {{questioning}} his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock to the Boston Red Sox in 1915. After returning from military service in 1919, Pennock became {{a regular contributor}} for the Red Sox. The Yankees acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season, and {{he served as a}} key member of <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> staff as the Yankees won four World Series championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox, and as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made an {{incorrect}} call in the 7th inning, for which he later received a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E

5|$|In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Smith {{served as}} <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> {{coach of the}} South Africa {{national}} baseball team, which was given 20,000 to 1 odds of winning the tournament. In 2007, Smith participated as a coach in the second annual European Baseball Academy for Major League Baseball International in Tirrenia, Italy. The Academy provides instruction to young players from Europe and Africa, several of whom have signed professional contracts.|$|E
5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation instead. It was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a {{candidate}} for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for 15 years, but failed to ever reach the 75% support threshold needed for election, peaking at 50%. After {{the end of his}} major league career, Smith spent time working as a pitching instructor at the minor-league level with the San Francisco Giants. He then served as <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> coach for the South Africa national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Lee currently continues his job as a minor-league roving pitching instructor for the Giants.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, he was demoted to {{the minor}} leagues to develop {{secondary}} pitches. From 2010 until 2012, his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated, but overall, was an underrated member of <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> staff, according to several writers. Nevertheless, he drew the ire of Phillies fans, who were tired of his inconsistency {{during the course of}} his career. After a successful 2012 campaign, however, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the 2013 season. Again in 2013, though, he was inconsistent, and entering 2014, some suggested he should be traded to another team.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{entered the}} 1948 Cleveland Indians season {{fighting}} for a spot on <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> staff after spending the offseason recovering from a knee injury, which had bothered the season prior, and while he did make the roster, he remained solely a relief pitcher to start the season. He made one start {{as a replacement for}} Don Black on June 6 against the Athletics, and won the game 11–1 in a complete game effort. Boudreau considered moving him into the starting rotation, but instead considered it a one-time appearance due to Black's injury, and he remained in a relief role though mid-July. After a second complete game victory against the Athletics on July 15, Gromek was moved to a part-time starter role, where he remained the rest of the season.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Lemon was {{the oldest}} Indian on the roster at age 37. Lemon pitched 3.1 innings over the span of two games before he {{was put on the}} Indians' {{disabled}} list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres. There he continued physical conditioning and mentored <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> staff of the Indians' top farm club. He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 walks, and 19 strikeouts. He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in only nine games that season. He earned just one decision that year, a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128. The club put him on waivers in July.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{was drafted}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 MLB draft. He {{worked his way through}} the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the {{youngest}} player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years when he did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to <b>the</b> <b>pitching</b> rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E

In his first start of the season, Richard gave up four runs in four innings against the defending World Series champion Cincinnati Reds on April 8. He followed this inauspicious beginning with wins in five of his next six decisions. One of them included a 10-inning shutout effort {{that led to a}} 16-inning 1–0 Astros victory against the Dodgers. By the end of May, however, Richard was sitting even with a 5–5 record, loser of four straight decisions. He closed {{the first half of the}} season by winning a 10-inning shutout against the Mets on July 6, and an eight-inning start against the Expos four days later. At the All-Star break, Richard had a 9–9 record with a 2.88ERA in over 153innings of work.|$|E
