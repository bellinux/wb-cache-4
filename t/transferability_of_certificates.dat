40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Farmer cooperatives {{have often}} {{maintained}} inflexible capital structures which severely restrict members' freedom to allocate their own capital {{in a most}} profitable manner. This {{study was conducted to}} provide insights into how cooperative finance programs might be modified to provide increased capital and, at the same time, be more acceptable to members. The revolving equity certificate means of finance was examined in depth. Of particular interest was the option of certificate transferability which would allow "capital-short" certificate holders the opportunity to reallocate at least a part of their investment in the cooperative association to more preferred investments on their own farms. An anlysis was designed to determine which types of farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, would be most likely to 1) possess the highest opportunity costs for capital investments on their farms and 2) buy and/or sell revolving equity certificates at some discounted present value of the certificates' specified face amounts. Cooperative member and nonmember preferences for selected means of finance were also examined. The acceptability of alternatives such as long-term interest-bearing notes, stock certificates, revolving equity certificates, and high member ship fees was rated by the farmers in the sample. Conclusions were then reached regarding the general acceptability among farmers of selected means of cooperative finance. Several groups of farmers, according to selected farmer characteristics, expressed a desire to participate in a market for transferable revolving equity certificates. It was concluded that <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> would provide an opportunity for many farmers to allocate their own capital in a more profitable fashion. Examination of the potential buyer-side of the equity certificate market revealed a relatively thin participation except at high rates of discount. In general, cooperatives could better serve their memberships by carefully planning their alternative means of finance, with. special consideration of those alternatives which would allow the members a reasonable degree of investment flexibility...|$|E

Implicit in such forecasts {{is the assumption}} that travellers tastes, as represented by the behavioural model parameters, are constant over time. This assumption {{is referred to as the}} temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the models. This thesis presents four main contributions in this area. First, a comprehensive review <b>of</b> the <b>transferability</b> literature in the context <b>of</b> the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models. This review demonstrated that there is little evidence about the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models over typical forecasting horizons, and further that most evidence is from models of commuter mode choice. Second, further empirical evidence on the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode destination models using data from Toronto and Sydney for transfer periods of up to 20 years in duration. The <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> commuter and non-commuter travel has been compared, and models of non-commute travel were found to be less temporally transferable. Improving model specification through fixed socio-economic parameters was found to improve model transferability, and the travel time and socio-economic parameters were found to be more transferability than the cost parameters and the model constants. Third, and most novel, what is believed to be the first empirical evidence on the impact of taking account of heterogeneity in cost and in-vehicle time sensitivity on the temporal <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models. This analysis demonstrated that while accounting for taste heterogeneity led to a better fit to the base data, there was no evidence that these models were more transferable than models without random heterogeneity. This may be due to the taste heterogeneity specification over-fitting the base data. Fourth, practical recommendations are presented for model developers on how to maximise the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models used for assessing policy...|$|R

Pharmacoeconomic guidelines were initially identified through the ISPOR Web site. In addition, those national guidelines not included in the ISPOR Web site, but known to us, were also considered. ResultsAcross 27 sets of guidelines, baseline risk and unit costs were uniformly considered to be <b>of</b> low <b>transferability,</b> while treatment effect was classified as highly transferable. Results were more variable for resource use and utilities, which were considered to have low transferability in 63 % and 45 % of cases, respectively. There were some differences between older and more recent guidelines in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>transferability</b> issues. ConclusionsA growing number of jurisdictions are using guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals. The recommendations in existing guidelines regarding the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> clinical and economic data are quite diverse. There is a case for standardization in dealing with transferability issues. One important step would be to update guidelines more frequently...|$|R
40|$|AIM) is a {{partitioning}} of {{the real}} space of a molecule into disjoint atomic constituents {{as determined by the}} topology of the electron density, �(r). This theory identifies an atom in a molecule with a quantum mechanical open system and, consequently, all of the atom’s properties are unambiguously defined. AIM recovers the basic empirical cornerstone of chemistry: that atoms and functional groups possess characteristic and additive properties that in many cases exhibit a remarkable transferability between different molecules. As a result, the theory enables the theoretical synthesis of a large molecule and the prediction of its properties by joining fragments that are predetermined as open systems. The present article is {{the first of a series}} (in preparation) that explore this possibility for polypeptides by determining the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the building blocks: the amino acid residues. <b>Transferability</b> <b>of</b> group properties requires <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the electron density �(r), which in turn requires the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the geometric parameters. This article demonstrates that these parameters are conformation-insensitive for a representative amino acid, leucine, and that the atomic and bond properties exhibit a corresponding <b>transferability.</b> The effects <b>of</b> hydrogen bonding are determined and a set of geometrical conditions for the occurrence of such bonding is identified. The effects of transforming neutral leucine into its zwitterionic form on its atomic and bond properties are shown to be localized primarily to the sites of ionization...|$|R

40|$|Spatial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> travel {{forecasting}} models, or {{the ability}} to transfer models from one geographical region to another, can potentially help in significant cost and time savings for regions that cannot invest in extensive data-collection and model-development procedures. This issue is particularly important in the context of tour-based/activity-based models whose development typically involves significant data inputs, skilled staff, and long production times. However, most literature on model transferability has been in the context of traditionally used trip-based models, particularly for linear regression-based trip generation and logit-based mode choice models, with little evidence on the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> activity-based models and that of emerging model structures. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to assess the spatial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> activity-based travel demand models. To this end, the specific objectives are to: 1. 	Survey the literature to synthesize: (a) the approaches used to transfer models, (b) the metrics used to assess model transferability, (c) the available evidence on spatial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> travel models, and (d) notable gaps in literature; 2. 	Lay out a framework for assessing the spatial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> activity-based travel forecasting model systems, and evaluate alternative methods/metrics used for assessing the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> specific model components and their parameters; 3. 	Conduct empirical assessments <b>of</b> spatial <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the following two model components used in today 2 ̆ 7 s activity-based model systems: (a) daily activity participation and time-use models, and (b) tour-based time-of-day choice models. Data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Travel Survey (BATS) were used for these empirical assessments; 4. 	Conduct empirical assessments <b>of</b> model <b>transferability</b> using emerging model structures that have begun to be used in activity-based model systems - specifically the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model; 5. 	Investigate alternate ways of enhancing model transferability; specifically: (a) pooling data from different geographical regions, and (b) improvements to the model structure. The dissertation provides a framework for assessing the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> activity-based models systems, along with empirical evidence on {{the pros and cons of}} alternative methods and metrics <b>of</b> <b>transferability</b> assessment. The results suggest the need to consider model sensitivity to changes in explanatory variables as opposed to relying solely on the ability to predict aggregate distributions. Updating the constants of a transferred model using local data (a widely used method to transfer models) was found to help in increasing the model 2 ̆ 7 s ability to predict aggregate patterns but not necessarily in enhancing its sensitivity to changes in explanatory variables. Also, transferability assessments ought to consider sampling variance in parameter estimates as opposed to only the point estimates. Empirical analysis with the daily activity participation and time-use model shed new light on the prediction properties of the MDCEV model structure that have implications for model transferability. This led to the development of a new model structure called the multiple discrete continuous heteroscedastic extreme value (MDCHEV) model that incorporates heteroscedasticity in the model 2 ̆ 7 s stochastic distributions and helps in enhancing model <b>transferability.</b> <b>Transferability</b> assessment <b>of</b> the time-of-day choice models show encouraging evidence <b>of</b> <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> a large proportion of the model coefficients, albeit except important parameters such as the travel time coefficients. Collectively, there is evidence that pooling data from multiple regions may help in building better transferable models than those transferred from a single region...|$|R

Implicit in such forecasts {{is the assumption}} that travelers’ tastes, as represented by the behavioral model parameters, are constant over time.

This paper summarizes the findings from a literature review that demonstrates there is little evidence about the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> mode-destination models over typical forecasting horizons. The literature review shows a relative lack of empirical studies given the importance of the issue. To provide further insights and evidence, models of commuter mode-destination choice been developed from household interview data collected across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in 1986, 1996, 2001, and 2006. The analysis demonstrates that improving model specification improves the <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the models, and in general the transferability declines as the transfer period increases. The <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the level-of-service parameters is higher than <b>transferability</b> <b>of</b> the cost parameters, which has important implications when considering the accuracy of forecasts for different types of policy.
