5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and {{the configuration of the}} gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E

There, they meet a Clan-like group of cats called the Tribe of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe takes <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> cats in and gives them food and shelter. The Clan cats discover that the Tribe cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of the Tribe. The Tribe thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect the Tribe from Sharptooth. Stormfur eventually agrees to help the Tribe.|$|E
5|$|The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) is an {{international}} multi-sport event organized by the International Olympic Committee. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. The idea of such an event was introduced by Johann Rosenzopf from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City approved {{the creation of a}} youth version of the Olympic Games, with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC.

The United States Numbered Highway System brought the arrival of the U.S. Route 40 (US-40) designation to the highway, on the same day the Lincoln Highway Association agreed to abandon their southerly route to Ely, and route the Lincoln Highway along the cut-off. Later, the cut-off was also designated as part of US-50 and US-50 Alternate (US-50Alt). Upon the completion of the parallel Interstate 80 (I-80), the previous U.S. Route designations were deleted from the United States Numbered Highway System, and the cut-off was turned over to the county.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{electric}} device applications {{of a high}} temperature superconducting (HTS) bulk having stable levitation and suspension properties due to their strong flux pinning force have been proposed and developed. We have been investigating the three-dimensional (3 -D) superconducting actuator using HTS bulk to develop the transportation device with non-contact and moves in free space. It is expected that our proposed 3 -D superconducting actuator to be useful as a transporter used in clean room which manufactures the silicon wafer where dislikes mechanical contact and dust. Proposed the actuator consists of a field-cooled HTS bulk for mover and two-dimensional arranged multiple electromagnets as a stator. In our previous study, the dynamic characteristics on <b>the</b> floor <b>traveling</b> of <b>the</b> HTS bulk mover had been studied. Therefore in this study, a system for <b>the</b> wall <b>traveling</b> was proposed to use the limited space effectively. It is expected that <b>the</b> wall <b>traveling</b> system is very useful to apply the transporter used in the tunnels which flammable gas may be produced. In this paper, the optimal angle between electromagnets located at floor and wall for moving to <b>the</b> wall <b>traveling</b> from <b>the</b> floor <b>traveling</b> was investigated experimentally. The position displacement on the rotating of the HTS bulk during <b>the</b> wall <b>traveling</b> was measured. As a result, the bulk with initial gap of 2 mm could move to <b>the</b> wall <b>traveling</b> from <b>the</b> floor <b>traveling.</b> Also, <b>the</b> position displacement on the height direction during the rotating of the HTS bulk was 18 mm from the initial position because of its gravity,but {{it was possible to}} rotate by changing the pattern NSNS of the trapped magnetic field in near the initial position...|$|R

25|$|During the turnaround, <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> twin {{is in an}} {{accelerated}} reference frame. According to the equivalence principle, <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> twin may analyze the turnaround phase as if the stay-at-home twin were freely falling in a gravitational field and as if <b>the</b> <b>traveling</b> twin were stationary. A 1918 paper by Einstein presents a conceptual sketch of the idea. From the viewpoint of the traveler, a calculation for each separate leg, ignoring the turnaround, leads to a result in which the Earth clocks age less than the traveler. For example, if the Earth clocks age 1day less on each leg, the amount that the Earth clocks will lag behind amounts to 2days. The physical description of what happens at turnaround has to produce a contrary effect of double that amount: 4days' advancing of the Earth clocks. Then the traveler's clock {{will end up with}} a net 2-day delay on the Earth clocks, in agreement with calculations done in the frame of the stay-at-home twin.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{relate the}} parsimonious {{property}} of relaxations of <b>the</b> Symmetric <b>Traveling</b> Salesman Polytope to a connectivity {{property of the}} ridge graph of <b>the</b> Graphical <b>Traveling</b> Salesman Polyhedron. This relationship is quite surprising. The proof is elegant and geometric: it makes use of recent results on ‚Äúflattening ‚Äù parts of the boundary complex of the polar of <b>the</b> Graphical <b>Traveling</b> Salesman Polyhedron. <b>The</b> Symmetric <b>Traveling</b> Salesman Polytope STSP(n) is the convex hull of all cycles (connected 2 -regular graphs) on a fixed vertex set V of cardinality n. <b>The</b> Graphical <b>Traveling</b> Salesman Polyhedron GTSP(n) is the convex hull of all connected Eulerian multi-graphs a fixed vertex set on V. It contains STSP(n) as a face, defined by a certain system of linear equations. A relaxation is a system of linear inequalities which are facet-defining for STSP(n) and GTSP(n). It has the parsimonious property if, for a certain set of linear objective functions, the following holds: the minimum of this function over the relaxation does not increase when the above mentioned equations {{are added to the}} relaxation. 1...|$|R
