5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese had been willing <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> in Cambodia {{as long as their}} supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and the debates {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{approved}} the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see also Soviet–Afghan relations) {{just as he}} had previously {{approved the}} Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. In both cases, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest for a possible armed intervention. Several leading members of the Soviet leadership decided to retain Brezhnev as General Secretary so that their careers would not suffer by a possible leadership reshuffling by his successor. Other members, who disliked Brezhnev, among them Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Mikhail Suslov (Central Committee Secretary), feared that Brezhnev's removal would spark a succession crisis, and so they helped <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Northern School greatly diminished after this, but Shenhui's disciples {{were unable}} <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of <b>the</b> Southern School or {{effectively}} propagate its teachings until Zongmi.

50|$|Zouche {{attempted}} to gain favour with the King by {{serving in the}} French campaign of 1492, but without evident success. His financial situation continued to suffer: his position was considered insufficient to allow him <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of a nobleman and he suffered the humiliation of being styled a mere knight.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, {{now turned}} its {{attention}} to the Klaipėda Region, then held by Lithuania. In April 1938, Hitler stated that control of the Port of Klaipėda (German: Memel) and its surrounding area was Germany's second-most important issue, following {{the status of the}} Sudeten area. In the event of armed hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, German troops were to defend and occupy the Klaipėda region and significant portions of western Lithuania. The Polish ambassador to Nazi Germany, Józef Lipski, was informed of these plans. The Poles agreed to cooperate with German troops and to respect German interests in Klaipėda if such an armed conflict were to arise. However, in Hitler's assessment, an immediate bid for Klaipėda was impolitic; he wished <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> until more time had passed after the Anschluss. The German suggestion was that Lithuania concede to the Polish demands.|$|E
5|$|The Aleutian Islands played little {{part in the}} {{proceedings}} of World War I, as the events of this war were concentrated in Europe. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the United States, the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy. Article XIX of the Treaty required Japan, Britain and the United States <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> in terms of military fortifications in their respective Pacific Rim territories. While Japan and Britain gained a number of exemptions from the terms of Article XIX (for example, Australia and New Zealand were not prevented from building up their fortifications {{as a result of}} the Treaty), Japan made it a requirement of their agreement to the Treaty that the Aleutian Islands were not to be exempted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{was established}} in 1979 and has been renewed for ten year periods in 1992 and 2002.

50|$|The School {{take over}} was in 1960. At first the school opted to remain private. But after {{struggling}} <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> for {{few years the}} school was {{handed over to the}} Government in 1964 during the term of then Director, Brother Edwin Ambrose. Thus the College obtained <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of a Non Fee Levying School. Since then the succeeding Brother Principals attempted to keep up the rising standard of St. Anne's College in spite of the changing educational environment.|$|R
5|$|To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun {{turned to}} another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, {{to whom he}} {{entrusted}} the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so {{that he had to}} be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824–825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo,</b> and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre both, so that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concept of}} pragmatic (or tactical or strategic) nonviolent action {{is to create}} a social dynamic or political movement that can create a national or international dialogue which effects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of war in}} the Taiwan Straits, even though quite low in the short-term, requires the PRC, ROC, and U.S. to remain wary and vigilant.

5000|$|Initially {{it served}} {{the role of}} a cant, or [...] "secret language", but in the late 19th century it became a {{standard}} sociolect of criminals. Grypsera is constantly evolving <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of a language understood only by a select group of inmates and not by the wardens or informers. Because of this it is currently one of the lexically richest dialects of the Polish language. Also, {{it is not possible to}} prepare a comprehensive dictionary of the dialect since it differs from prison to prison.|$|R
25|$|The social {{aspect of}} Frondizi's {{government}} was influenced more by pressure groups than {{by its own}} initiative.

25|$|The Speaker {{usually comes}} from among MPs of the {{governing}} party. But {{because he or she}} cannot vote unless his or her vote would break a tie and by convention must vote <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition's power by electing an opposition speaker.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a poll {{conducted}} by the Taiwan Braintrust showed that about 90 {{percent of the population}} would identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese if they were to choose between the two.

30|$|Changes {{have been}} {{observed}} in these programs {{for the inclusion of}} issues related to sustainability (e.g.: Stubbs and Cocklin 2008; Palma et al. 2011; Demajorovic and Silva 2012). Yet, these are still incipient and often related <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> quo, without <b>the</b> intention of rebuilding or moving towards sustainable, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary proposals. According to Carvalho et al. (2014), there is still a lack {{in the construction of the}} most robust educational actions, with regard to educating a new generation of managers prepared to meet the demands of a sustainable logic.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} {{made every}} attempt <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of a top-level tournament. Newcastle United were {{expelled from the}} 1976-77 competition for playing a weakened team in {{the first leg of}} their quarter-final against Ayr United. Over the years, however, English entrants were increasingly drawn from the lower divisions and in 1981 the Scottish clubs withdrew as the public showed little interest in the competition. As the final winners, Chesterfield still hold the trophy and it is displayed in their Board Room. The competition continued, with English clubs only, as the Football League Group Cup.|$|R

25|$|Both states {{agreed to}} {{initiate}} dialogue over issues in West Asia, Central Asia and Africa as {{confidence building measures}} towards enhancement of political interaction.

On the economic front, Hu stated that he would work towards facilitating Indian exports to China; Singh called for Chinese investments in the Indian manufacturing and infrastructure sectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of the designation of these territories as occupied territory is that certain legal obligations fall on the occupying power under international law. Under international law there are certain laws of war governing military occupation, including the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the Fourth Geneva Convention. One of those obligations is <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> until the signing of a peace treaty, the resolution of specific conditions outlined in a peace treaty, or {{the formation of a}} new civilian government.|$|E

25|$|On 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali {{informed}} Britain, and France that {{he intended}} to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.

With Muhammad Ali’s intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war.

25|$|What {{has been}} lost beneath the clouds of myths {{surrounding}} this situation {{is the reason why}} many clubs were cautious about wholeheartedly supporting the road-racing movement. Remember that it was wartime and the younger membership of most clubs was away engaged in a war. The older members left at home did not wish to risk damaging a sport which all had enjoyed, so they decided <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> until the war ended. The rank and file of the NCU/RTTC membership was not anti-BLRC - all it wanted to do was preserve the sport until the service men returned to civvy street.|$|E
