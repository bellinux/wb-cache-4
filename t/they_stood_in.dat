5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as <b>they</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|When taxes once {{payable to}} Rome were {{transferred}} to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as <b>they</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the Valor Ecclesiasticus. In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions. In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made {{the lives of the}} monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution. In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly {{to the beginning of the}} state-enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536. After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some £90,000 a year. The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed. Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently. Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.|$|E

Though Černý seems to think that the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G.

25|$|Ethnic German {{refugees}} and expellees of foreign or no citizenship, residing within the German borders as <b>they</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> 1937, were granted German citizenship by the West German constitution (Grundgesetz), Art.116 (1) when this came into force in 1949. Expellees arriving {{later in the}} Federal Republic of Germany were almost all granted German citizenship as well, but their detailed legal treatment varied, depending on their or their ancestors' citizenship. Aussiedler (see above) who themselves or whose ancestors had been German citizens before 1945 were mostly legally considered as being German citizens, regardless of any other citizenships they may have held. According to the Nationality Law of the German Empire and States (Reichs- und Staatsangehörigkeitsgesetz; RuStAG) of 1913, valid until 1999, loss of German citizenship was only valid if one applied for it (RuStAG §21 (1)), and the competent German authority issued a denaturalisation deed (Entlassungsurkunde, RuStAG §23 (1)), and the person to be denaturalised emigrated from German territory within a year after starting the procedure (RuStAG §24 (1)).|$|E

500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that <b>they</b> <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion." ...|$|E
