[...] "In 'space opera' (the {{analogy is}} with the Western 'horse opera' rather than the 'soap opera') the reverse is {{referring}} to his definition of [...] "hard sf" [...] is true; a melodramatic adventure-fantasy involving stock themes and settings is evolved on <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> scientific basis." ...|$|R

50|$|Outnumbered by 80 Texans, Baca {{holed up}} in a jacal, <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> kind of hut, and was besieged by the mob.

25|$|On {{the night}} of 17/18 May 1918 French had Sinn Féin leaders arrested and {{documents}} were seized, but even supporters like Repington and Macready were disappointed {{at the lack of}} clear evidence of collaboration with the Germans and <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> legal grounds for the arrests, which caused endless legal wrangles. Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha escaped arrest and increased their own power in the vacuum created by the arrest of more moderate leaders.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the bridge's poor safety record for its customers, oil lamps {{were added to the}} deck in 1799, making Battersea Bridge the first Thames bridge to be lit. Between 1821 and 1824 <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> wooden fences along the edges of the bridge, which were often breaking, were {{replaced}} by sturdy iron [...] railings, and in 1824 the oil lamps were themselves replaced by gas lighting.|$|E
500|$|Sam and Quinn's burgeoning {{relationship}} {{met with}} a fairly positive response. Canning would have preferred for them to become friends first, and Benigno deemed their sexual tension unrealistic, based on Sam's success at charming Quinn in Na'vi, the fictional language of Avatar. However, while Berk declared himself [...] "fully exhausted with <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> cheerleader/quarterback paradigm", Sam's Na'vi and Matthew McConaughey impression led him to concede that they are [...] "cute together". Stack and Mullins shared this sentiment, and VanDerWerff called their flirtation [...] "exceptionally well-handled".|$|E

Supreme Court justices, first, on <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of pretexts, outrageously stopped an ongoing, soon-to-be {{completed}} vote recount and then, in the most scandalously partisan and dishonest judicial opinion in recent history, hand-delivered the presidency to fellow right-wing Republican George Bush...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are moments}} {{in the life of}} every philosopher and dreamer when he feels himself <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of absurdities, when the Thing in Being has its way with him, its triumphant way, when it asks in a roar, unanswerably, with a fine solid use of the current vernacular, [...] "What Good is all this--Rot about Utopias?" ...|$|R
500|$|Around eleven, {{the five}} {{warships}} began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> American breastworks and panicked the Connecticut militia. [...] "So terrible and so incessant a roar of guns few {{even in the}} army and navy had ever heard before," [...] wrote Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe. Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a full hour. The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust. After the guns ceased, the British flatboats appeared out of the smoke and headed for shore. By then the Americans were in a panicked retreat, and the British began their amphibious landing.|$|E
500|$|Cryptum was {{met with}} varying reviews. Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, [...] "It's hard to care about <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive {{throughout}} and overall, not enough happens." [...] He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, [...] "This is one for the die-hard Halo fans." [...] Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. The author of Artistic Gamings review of Cryptum {{found it difficult to}} like the book's characters due to the condescending tone of Bornstellar, also concluding that it is only suited to diehard fans. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson. Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense.|$|E
2500|$|While Block {{continued}} to receive positive press and his jokes {{during the show}} were often quoted in newspaper columns, there was also criticism. Journalist William S. Schlamm wrote in the June 2, 1952 issue of The Freeman that Block, [...] "on <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> ground of being a gag writer, {{for more than a}} year has kept claiming dispensation from elementary rules of taste." [...] By 1953, producers had given Block repeated warnings about his behavior which he was apparently ignoring.|$|E
5000|$|Ted Pearson, Co-Chairperson of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, said [...] "This case {{reeks of}} the kind of white {{supremacy}} that shocked the nation 80 years ago when nine Black teenagers were falsely accused and sentenced to death in Alabama for the rape of two white girls on <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of evidence." [...] Pearson believed that global outrage was necessary to free Morgan.|$|R
60|$|Garnache {{sat back}} in his chair and {{surveyed}} the man, smiling. Quick though his temper usually might be, it was checked at present by amusement. He had seen in his time many quarrels spring from <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of motives, but surely never had he seen one quite so self-begotten. It was almost as if the fellow had come there of set purpose to pick it with him.|$|R
60|$|Dick smiled wearily. It is not {{pleasant}} {{to live in}} the company of a notion that will not work out, a fox-terrier that cannot talk, and a woman who talks too much. He would have answered, but at that moment there unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil, as it were, of <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> gauze. He rubbed his eyes, but the gray haze would not go.|$|R
2500|$|Abram cannot sleep, tossing {{and turning}} {{from side to}} side... Finally his wife Sarah inquires: [...] "Abram, what's bothering you?"

My Abram still owes you 20 roubles? Well he isn't giving them back!" [...] / Turning to her husband, she says reassuringly: [...] "Now go to sleep and let Moishe stay awake!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Lewis of Allmusic felt {{it showed}} them [...] "as a talented young band, despite <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> songwriting {{and the lack}} of light and shade on the album". While Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it {{provides}} [...] "a mature, complete range – from the early-penned punk mayhem of 'Blame' to the delicacy of the 'Twilight=Dusk', from the dark tones of 'Jerks of Attention' to the bright strains of radio hit 'Leaving Home'. The album does a great job of capturing the amazing live dynamic of the band".|$|E
2500|$|The {{curtains}} rose while backstage personnel {{hastened to}} bring the fire under control, the actors beginning the scene. After speaking a few lines, Claxton was {{made aware of the}} fire by Lillian Cleaves, another actress backstage who was standing behind the box set. She whispered sotto voce through the canvas of the boathouse that there was fire on stage and urged them to leave. Kate Claxton recalled peering up through <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> canvas of the box set and seeing “sparks falling and little tongues of the fire licking the edges of the drops and borders that hung in the flies.” ...|$|E
50|$|It {{might be}} argued that Beck {{and his wife are}} already getting estranged. It only takes <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> amounts of passive-aggressiveness from his {{superiors}} to make him give up his holiday, even though both make clear to him that he does not have to go if he does not want to. Although he reflects on his marriage several times (as does the narrator on marriage in general), he does not draw any conclusions yet.|$|R
5000|$|Mostert {{has also}} linked {{the use of}} Facilitated Communication (FC), with its [...] "serious {{problems}} of validity and logic," [...] with Nazi-era pseudoscience. He wrote in a 2001 article: [...] "The results of these actions were extremely damaging, both practically and ethically, to many people FC was supposed to assist. The reactions of {{many members of the}} public and media, who embraced FC based on <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of evidence, were hardly less astonishing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were decidedly mixed. People gave the film a B review in its [...] "picks and pans" [...] column. Matthew E. Bunson in his Encyclopedia Sherlockiana opined [...] "this is a {{surprisingly}} disappointing production despite {{the best efforts of}} all concerned and lavish attention to detail." [...] Alan Barnes in Sherlock Holmes on Screen wrote that the film [...] "is no more than a number of high-concept set-pieces linked by <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of stories." ...|$|R
2500|$|After Lily's departure, Baby Doe and Silver Dollar {{moved into}} a cabin {{on the site of}} the Matchless mine. The living {{quarters}} were basic and inadequate for Colorado winters: [...] "All told, it was no larger than a medium sized room. Two windows had been cut into <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> weatherboards, but these had been nailed up". [...] The structure was a former tool shed located adjacent to the hoisthouse, described by a visitor in 1927 as [...] "crowded with very primitive furniture, decorated with religious pictures, and stacked high in newspapers." [...] The cabin was isolated, located above Leadville in Little Strayhorse Gulch, and had an unimpeded view of Mount Elbert and Mount Massive.|$|E
2500|$|The first unit {{to cross}} about a [...] {{from the river}} mouth was a company of the 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), of the 156th Brigade. Several of <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> boats collapsed, and the men were forced to wade across the chest deep river. Once across they {{established}} a bridgehead on the Ottoman bank of the river. When they were secure the engineers started building a pontoon bridge, for the main force to cross. By 23:00 almost three of the division's battalions had crossed the river. The 8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and the 4th Battalion, Royal Scots, from the 156th Brigade and the 7th Battalion Highland Light Infantry from the 157th Brigade.|$|E
2500|$|Kasparov further {{wrote in}} his June 2013 Daily Beast article that the mass protests in Moscow 18 months earlier against {{fraudulent}} Russian elections had been [...] "a proud moment for me." [...] He recalled that after joining the opposition movement in March 2005, he had been criticized for seeking to unite [...] "every anti-Putin element {{in the country to}} march together regardless of ideology." [...] Therefore, the sight of [...] "hundreds of flags representing every group from liberals to nationalists all marching together for 'Russia Without Putin' was the fulfillment of a dream." [...] Yet most Russians, he lamented, had continued to [...] "slumber" [...] even as Putin had [...] "taken off <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> mask of democracy to reveal himself in full as the would-be KGB dictator he has always been." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Caryll stepped between them, {{his back}} to his lordship, that he might act as a screen under cover of which to dispose safely of that {{dangerous}} document. But he was too late. Her ladyship's quick eyes had flashed to it, and if the distance precluded the possibility of her discovering anything that might be written upon it, she, nevertheless, could see the curious nature of the paper, which was of <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> tissue of a sort extremely uncommon.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the winter}} of 2011/12 a special needs block was added and a larger caretakers garage was added (replacing <b>the</b> rather <b>flimsy</b> [...] "caretakers shed") ...|$|R
60|$|The {{seafaring}} settlements {{are connected}} with the interior by breakneck paths and by rude steps, slippery with green moss. The people seem to delight in standing, like wild goats, upon the dizziest of 'jumpy' peaks; we see boys perched like birds upon impossible places, and men walking along precipice-faces apparently pathless. The villages are joined to one another by roads which attempt to follow the sea-line; the chasms are spanned by <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> wooden bridges, and the cliff is tunnelled or cut into a corniche.|$|R
2500|$|Frank Valori, a {{representative}} of Leonard Fairclough, later revealed to Lord Esher that he had undertaken the demolition [...] "without pleasure" [...] and had offered to provide the Government with an alternative site at his own expense at which he would store the stones of the portico {{with a view to}} re-erecting it elsewhere. This offer was [...] "disdainfully rejected by the Government on <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> pretext that no place could ever be found." [...] Valori presented a silver model of the arch to Lord Esher who admitted that the gesture [...] "made him feel as if some man had murdered his wife and then presented him with her bust". Valori later incorporated part of the arch into the stonework of the house which he had constructed for himself in Bromley.|$|E
2500|$|Ward Morehouse of The New York Sun declared, [...] "The {{big news}} about Annie Get Your Gun {{is that it}} reveals Ethel Merman in her best form since Anything Goes...She shouts the Berlin music with good effect. She often comes {{to the aid of}} a sagging book". He stated, [...] "Irving Berlin's score is not a notable one, but his tunes are singable and {{pleasant}} and his lyrics are particularly good. The book? It's on <b>the</b> <b>flimsy</b> side, definitely. And rather witless too". Lewis Nichols of The New York Times said, [...] "It has a pleasant score by Irving Berlin...and it has Ethel Merman to roll her eyes and to shout down the rafters. The colors are pretty, the dancing is amiable and unaffected, and Broadway by this time is well used to a book which doesn't get anywhere in particular".|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} {{waves of}} rebuilding which {{have resulted in}} the total eradication of the earlier medieval structures are easily explained by the parallel phases of development seen elsewhere in the county. In particular the [...] "Age of Improvement", roughly from 1750 to 1850 saw rapid gains in agricultural and industrial efficiency. [...] Milburn would have benefited significantly from enhanced crop yields and from the opening of the mines which also occurred at this time (references to the rich Silverband mine on Dun Fell, behind the village, appear from 1709). The scale of the improvement in rural fortunes is demonstrated by the stylish ambition guiding the design of the replacement buildings. Doors are adorned with classical features such as architraves and pediments, and windows are surrounded by elaborate mouldings. [...] It seems likely that medieval structures first began to disappear at this time, the process being consolidated as the improvement in the wealth of the village continued during the 19th century. [...] <b>The</b> <b>flimsy</b> nature of the earlier structures has ensured that nothing from the medieval phase survives, though it is notable that many of the replacement buildings contain timbers which have clearly had an earlier history. [...] It is very common, for example, to find exposed oak beams which now support floors but which contain joints which show they used {{to be part of a}} roof. Similarly many beams are drilled to show they once formed part of wattle and daub partitions.|$|E
40|$|Graphene nanoribbons are <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> {{material}} {{systems in}} the world, and they get readily distorted. Distortion by twisting, for one, {{is important because it}} couples to ribbon's electronic properties. In this Letter, using simulations with density-functional tight-binding and revised periodic boundary conditions, I show that twisting appears almost equivalent to stretching; electronic structures in a given nanoribbon either upon twisting or upon certain stretching are quantitatively similar. This simple equivalence will provide a valuable guideline for interpreting and designing experiments with these flimsy ribbons. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Barrister Matthew Scott, a {{consistent}} {{critic of the}} site's modus operandi, stated that [...] "it has generated a poisonous atmosphere of outrage and hysteria in which wild and immensely hurtful accusations can be made and believed on <b>the</b> <b>flimsiest</b> of evidence; and that by publicising detailed allegations of paedophile orgies and murder it has risked destroying the prospect of fair trials either for victims or defendants."

5000|$|While {{adequate}} for {{transport by road}} in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>flimsies</b> proved to be extremely unsatisfactory during the North African Campaign and severely hampered {{the operation of the}} British Eighth Army. The transport of fuel over rough terrain often resulted in much of the fuel (as much as 25 percent) being lost as the containers were easily punctured. Leakages also made vehicles liable to catch fire. Cargo ships loaded with fuel in flimsies were also dangerous, with leaking fuel accumulating in cargo holds. At least one such ship exploded.|$|R
