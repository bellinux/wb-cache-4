2500|$|A major {{tenet of}} {{the theory is that}} {{engaging}} in acts of self-control draws from a limited [...] "reservoir" [...] of self-control that, when depleted, results in reduced capacity for further self-regulation. Self-control is viewed as analogous to a muscle: Just as a muscle requires strength and energy <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> over a period of time, acts that have high self-control demands also require strength and energy to perform. Similarly, as muscles become fatigued after a period of sustained exertion and have reduced capacity to exert further force, self-control can also become depleted when demands are made of self-control resources over a period of time. Baumeister and colleagues termed the state of diminished self-control strength ego depletion (or cognitive depletion).|$|E
60|$|In {{all that}} {{concerns}} possession {{and the use}} of force, unrestrained liberty involves anarchy and injustice. Freedom to kill, freedom to rob, freedom to defraud, no longer belong to individuals, though they still belong to great states, and are exercised by them in the name of patriotism. Neither individuals nor states ought to be free <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> on their own initiative, except in such sudden emergencies as will subsequently be admitted in justification by a court of law. The {{reason for this is that}} the exertion of force by one individual against another is always an evil on both sides, and can only be tolerated when it is compensated by some overwhelming resultant good. In order to minimize the amount of force actually exerted in the world, it is necessary that there should be a public authority, a repository of practically irresistible force, whose function should be primarily to repress the private use of force. A use of force is private when it is exerted by one of the interested parties, or by his friends or accomplices, not by a public neutral authority according to some rule which is intended to be in the public interest.|$|E

5000|$|Muscle weakness, {{also known}} as muscle fatigue, (or [...] "lack of strength") refers to the {{inability}} <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> with one's skeletal muscles.

There is also a gradual onset of muscle weakness as a result of sarcopenia - the age-related loss of skeletal muscle.|$|E
50|$|Ship {{stabilizers}} are fins or rotors mounted {{beneath the}} waterline and emerging laterally from the hull to reduce a ship's roll due to wind or waves. Active fins {{are controlled by}} a gyroscopic control system. When the gyroscope senses the ship roll, it changes the fins' angle of attack <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> to counteract the roll. Fixed fins and bilge keels do not move; they reduce roll by hydrodynamic drag exerted when the ship rolls. Stabilizers are mostly used on ocean-going (blue water) ships.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{spinning}} mass is balanced, the only possibility {{to speed up}} the rotation is for the sides of the groove <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>forces</b> on the ends of the axle. Furthermore, the normal and axial forces will have no effect, so tangential force must be provided by friction.

50|$|There are {{number of}} reasons why this has been {{observed}} only in Hawaii. First, the ocean reacts slowly to fast-changing winds; winds must be steady <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> on the ocean, such as the trade winds. Second, the high mountain topography provides a significant disturbance to the winds. Third, the Hawaiian Islands are large in horizontal (east-west) scale, extending over four degrees in longitude. It is this active interaction between wind, ocean current, and temperature that creates this uniquely long wake west of Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|Muscle atrophy {{is defined}} as a {{decrease}} in the mass of the muscle; it can be a partial or complete wasting away of muscle, and is most commonly experienced when persons suffer temporary disabling circumstances such as being restricted in movement and/or confined to bed as when hospitalized. When a muscle atrophies, this leads to muscle weakness, since the ability <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> is related to mass. Modern medicine's understanding of the quick onset of muscle atrophy is a major factor behind the practice of getting hospitalized patients out of bed and moving about as active as possible as soon as is feasible, despite sutures, wounds, broken bones and pain.|$|E

One of the essential elements of accurizing a firearm {{is to make sure that}} this force does not disrupt the bullet from its path. The worst case is a muzzle or muzzle device such as a flash-hider that is cut at a non-square angle, so that one side of the bullet leaves the barrel early; this will cause the gas to escape in an asymmetric pattern, and will push the bullet away from that side, causing shots to form a [...] "string", where the shots cluster along a line rather than forming a normal Gaussian pattern.|$|E

50|$|Although Indian Rock {{may appear}} to be several rocks piled together, it {{actually}} originated as a single boulder (18 ft by 9 ft by 15 ft). Weaknesses within the rock caused by foliation and naturally occurring fractures serve as avenues for moisture infiltration. With repeated freeze-thaw cycles, this moisture expands <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>forces</b> up <b>to</b> 20,000 lbs/inch2 along the planes of weakness, thus wedging the rock apart. Glacial polish, striations and grooves commonly found on erratics of this size have for the most part been effaced by the normal process of decomposition called weathering.|$|R
50|$|In Thylacosmilus, {{the last}} and most {{specialized}} known member, the incisors are very small and the lower teeth are poorly developed, and tack-shaped; in the other genera these elements are unknown. In Thylacosmilus, the upper incisors are unknown other than by wear indentations on the lower incisors, as no premaxilla has ever been found complete in this genus.Another evolutionary trend in families is the progressive reduction of masseter and temporal muscles, resulting in relatively weak bites, but compensated by {{the increase in the}} size of the neck muscles to lower the head and the fangs into the necks of their prey. Fossils of Thylacosmilus forelimbs, the only reported for this group, indicate that animals were not fast runners, and were in turn adapted <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> in order to subdue their prey, helping with their semiopposable thumb.|$|E
50|$|GRF {{is often}} {{observed}} to evaluate force production in various {{groups within the}} community.

Plyometric jumps such as a drop-jump is an activity often used to build greater power and force {{which can lead to}} overall better ability on the playing field. When landing from a safe height in a bilateral comparisons on GRF in relation to landing with the dominant foot first followed by the non-dominant limb, literature has shown there were no significances in bilateral components with landing with the dominant foot first faster than the non-dominant foot on the GRF of the drop-jump or landing on vertical GRF output.|$|E
5000|$|Offensive terror can {{be defined}} as the killing of people, {{destruction}} of property, kidnapping, etc. It is usually a minor part of subversion and, [...] "is used not <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> in the transfer of state power, but is meant to cower the people or ruler". Force used in this manner is meant to reinforce other forms or persuasion in addition to cowering the people or leaders.

Terror also provides a practical motivation of physically removing political opponents. The assassination of an organization’s leader may open the door to a successor that is more friendly to the subversives position or possibly someone that has successfully infiltrated the organization and is in fact one of the subversives.|$|E

5000|$|The lifter {{begins the}} first phase of the pull, or [...] "Pre-lift off", with the feet placed {{approximately}} hip width apart, toes turned out slightly with the bar above the midfoot. The shins will be inclined toward the bar so that the shin is touching or close to the bar. Hips are placed so that the top of the thigh is approximately parallel to the ground but may also be slightly higher or lower depending on the lifter. The lifters back should be straight, no excessive curvature or rounding in the lumbar spine, with slight extension of the thoracic spine and shoulders slightly pulled back. [...] The shoulders should be positioned so that they are directly over or slightly forward of the bar. The bar is gripped with a very wide grip.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2008. Major: Biomedical Engineering. Advisor: David J. Odde. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 120 pages, appendices A-B. As the major structural {{element of the}} cell, the cytoskeleton plays {{a vital role in}} response and transmission of forces in both extracellular and intracellular environments. For instance, in cell motility, the cell utilizes a host of proteins to physically link F-actin to the extracellular substrate, allowing the cell <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> traction <b>forces</b> as well as probe the mechanics of its local environment. During mitosis, the cell constructs a mitotic spindle, using microtubules and kinetochores <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>forces</b> that segregate sister chromatids. Ultimately, understanding how cells build these robust molecular machines for unique tasks could one day lead to therapeutics that treat disease causing dysfunctions in these vital cellular processes. In order to explore how molecular clutches work in concert with the cytoskeleton <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>forces</b> and maintain attachment under load, we developed a mechano-chemical cellular adhesion dynamics framework to simulate these processes. In the case of cellular motility, we find that a "motor-clutch" mechanism exhibits substrate-stiffness sensitive dynamics. On soft substrates, motor-clutch motility exhibits "load-and-fail" dynamics that lead to higher rates of retrograde flow and lower traction force transmission compared to stiff substrates. We confirm these predictions experimentally using embryonic chick forebrain neurons (ECFNs) plated on compliant polyacrylamide gels (PAGs) demonstrating that a motor clutch system could be the basis of cellular mechanosensing. We also use cellular adhesion dynamics to explore kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis to identify what properties might be important in maintaining attachment during mitosis. We show that molecular clutch microtubule-lattice diffusion is important for relieving clutch stresses, prolonging bond life-times and minimizing detachment forces. Furthermore, molecular clutches that preferentially associate with interdimer interfaces, rather than with intradimer interfaces, promote robust kinetochore attachment by preventing the more distal, attachment-promoting linkers from becoming nonproductive. These findings help further our understanding of the mechanochemical basis of kinetochore attachment and mitosis, a process essential throughout development...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{balloons}} have {{a certain}} elasticity to them {{that needs to be}} taken into account. The act of stretching a balloon fills it with potential energy. When it is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and the balloon snaps back into its original position, though perhaps a little stretched out. When a balloon is filled with air, the balloon is being stretched. While the elasticity of the balloon causes tension that would have the balloon collapse, it is also being pushed back out by the constant bouncing of the internal air molecules. The internal air has <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>force</b> not only to counteract the external air to keep the air pressures [...] "even", but it also has to counteract the natural contraction of the balloon. Therefore, it requires more air pressure (or force) than the air outside the balloon wall. Because of this, when helium balloons are left and they float higher, as atmospheric pressure decreases, the air inside it exerts more pressure than outside it so the balloon pops from tension. In some cases, the helium leaks out from pores and the balloon deflates, falling down.|$|E
