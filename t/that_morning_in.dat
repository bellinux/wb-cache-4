5|$|The {{squall line}} finally overtook the supercells {{just after midnight}} on March2, after putting down 37 tornadoes that day. As the squall line overtook the cells, a few tornadoes — all EF0 — took place {{overnight}} in Florida and extreme southern Georgia within the squall line, before the severe weather emerged in the Atlantic Ocean that morning. The final tornado was a landfalling waterspout in the Outer Banks of North Carolina late <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the tornadoes, widespread straight-line wind damage from microbursts were also reported, along with scattered large hail, the largest of which were the size of baseballs.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, Kitchener {{ordered a}} flying column, led by Major-General Sir Archibald Hunter and {{composed}} of around three-thousand Egyptian soldiers, to march from Merowe to Abu Hamed with all possible speed. The flying column departed Merawi on 29 July 1897, and, marching north-east along the Nile for eight days, {{arrived at the}} town as dawn broke on August 7. Forming his battalions in a broad semi-circle that pitted Abu Hamed’s defenders against the river, Major-General Hunter ordered his troops to advance at approximately six-thirty <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> the action that followed, the outnumbered Mahdist riflemen were driven from their defensive positions through the town, while a small contingent of Mahdist cavalry fled south without engaging to report the loss. By seven-thirty, the battle was over, and Major-General Hunter ordered the news be delivered to Lord Kitchener.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} the Dublin car bombs went off at about 17:30 on Talbot Street, near the {{intersection}} with Lower Gardiner Street. Talbot Street was the main route from the city centre to Connolly station, Dublin's primary railway station. It was parked at 18 Talbot Street, on the north side, opposite Guineys department store. The bomb car was a metallic blue mink Ford Escort, registration number 1385 WZ. It had been stolen <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> the Docks area of Belfast. The blast damaged buildings and vehicles {{on both sides of}} the street. People suffered severe burns and were struck by shrapnel, flying glass and debris; some were hurled through the windows of shops.|$|E

25|$|Clemens won an {{emotional}} start on September 15, following his mother's death <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> his final {{start of the}} 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On October 9, 2005, Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to get win as the Astros defeated the Atlanta Braves in Game four of the National League Division Series. It is the longest postseason game in MLB history at eighteen innings. Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the 2005 World Series, and the Astros went on to be swept by the Chicago White Sox. It was the Astros' first World Series appearance. Clemens had aggravated a hamstring pull that had limited his performance since at least September.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 November, the Prussians left Waren. Blücher moved to the {{northeast}} via Hohen Wangelin, covered by a rear guard under General-Major Friedrich Gottlieb von Oswald. Winning marched east along {{the north shore of}} several lakes, covered by Oberst von Pletz's rear guard. <b>That</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Waren, Colonel Claude-Étienne Guyot with the 400-strong 22nd Chasseurs à Cheval from Soult's corps surrounded and captured Major Schmude and 170 dragoons. However, when Guyot tried to advance from the town, Pletz counterattacked with 850 horsemen of the Köhler Hussar Regiment # 7. For a loss of only one killed, 15 wounded, and 10 missing, the Prussian hussars threw Guyot's cavalry back into Waren and freed Schmude and his men. The French lost six officers killed or wounded, over 40 men captured, and an unknown number killed or wounded in this minor Prussian victory.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{is a legal}} penalty in Singapore. The city-state had the second highest per-capita execution rate in the world between 1994 and 1998, estimated by the United Nations to be 13.83 executions annually per one million people during that period. The highest was Turkmenistan (now an abolitionist country) with 14.92. However, since the 2010s, execution has become far less common, with some years having no executions at all. No one was executed in 2012 and 2013, and two persons were executed in 2014. Each execution in Singapore is carried out by long drop hanging in Changi Prison at dawn on Friday, except once on 20 May 2016 when the execution of Kho Jabing was carried out at 3:30pm after his appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> a survey done in 2005, reported in The Straits Times, 95% of Singaporeans believe that their country should retain the death penalty.|$|E
5000|$|Coalville has a high-altitude humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfb), characterised by extreme diurnal temperature ranges {{that range from}} extremely cold winter nights to hot afternoons in the summer. However, the high altitude and low humidity means <b>that</b> <b>mornings</b> <b>in</b> summer remain very cool, and frosts have occasionally occurred even in July. Precipitation is moderate throughout the year, though with a minimum in summer, and snow accumulation is generally heavy due to the very cold nights between November and March, with a median of 60.1 in for the year.|$|R

25|$|Finally at 8pm on April 21, 1975, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu officially {{resigned}} {{from his position}} as the President of the Republic of Vietnam upon learning that Xuan Loc had fallen <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> his final effort to save South Vietnam, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu gambled his political career by sending the very last units of the South Vietnamese army to Xuan Loc {{in an attempt to}} hold off the North Vietnamese 4th Army Corps. Ultimately, however, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's effort came too late. The defeat at Xuan Loc only added salt into the wound of Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's political career, as the National Assembly grew hostile towards his handling of the war. One day after Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's departure to Taiwan, Trần Văn Hương was appointed as South Vietnam's President, and he was ordered to seek a negotiated peace with North Vietnam at any cost, to the disappointment of many in South Vietnam's political elite, who argued that the situation could have been different if Thieu had gone earlier.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of January 1, 1863, with almost all ships, {{including}} Harriet Lane, anchored in the channel, an alarm was raised reporting Confederate forces approaching. With only the Westfield ready to maneuver, she sailed upriver {{in an attempt to}} engage the approaching Confederate vessels. The Westfield grounded, but the attack was reckoned to be merely a retreat by Confederate ships, and the alarm was cancelled. There was, however, a Confederate land force under the command of General John B. Magruder that was approaching Galveston. At four o'clock <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>in</b> what would {{come to be known as}} the Battle of Galveston, the reoccupied Confederate forts opened fire on the Union fleet while ground troops attempted to board the anchored ships. The late arrival of a Confederate fleet enabled the troops to board the Harriet Lane, which was raked by gunfire and rammed, leaving Wainright dead and Lea mortally wounded. In one of the war's most poignant incidents, when Lea was mortally wounded, his father, Confederate Major Albert M. Lea was serving ashore in Galveston. He came aboard the Harriet Lane only to realize his son was near death.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of 29 to 30 August, the corps was {{pulled out of the}} line and {{concentrated}} in the forest a kilometer south of Meshalkino in order to carry out an attack on Sorokino planned for <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the 154th Rifle Division and 12th Tank Corps. The attack was cancelled due to the heavy losses suffered by both the 12th Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division in the previous fighting, and the 15th also required time to reorganize. During the day the corps' 195th Tank Brigade conducted the only combat action, a successful operation to relieve two encircled battalions of the 61st Army's 156th Rifle Division. While the main forces of the 3rd Tank Army had been fighting at Sorokino, the 3rd Tank Corps had achieved a measure of success, crossed the Vytebet River, and begun fighting to capture Volosovo. As a result, the 15th Corps and the 154th were relocated to the Kumovo area on the right flank, and the 15th was tasked with exploiting the breakthrough to capture Perestryazh.|$|E

500|$|In {{the script}} for the pilot, [...] "Mr. Monk and the Candidate", Monk is {{described}} as being [...] "a modern day Sherlock Holmes", only [...] "nuts". In the introductory scene of the episode, he is examining the scene of Nicole Vasques' murder, and picks up several important clues, but frequently interrupts himself to wonder aloud whether he left his stove on {{when he left the}} house <b>that</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>In</b> the season 6 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Daredevil", Monk mentions that he has 312 phobias. The strongest of these phobias are: germs, dentists, sharp or pointed objects, milk, vomiting, death and dead things, snakes, crowds, heights, fear, mushrooms, and small spaces, as Monk also mentions in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man". In addition, new phobias develop at seemingly random intervals, such as a temporary fear of blankets {{at the end of the}} season 5 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink". Though it is impossible to determine his strongest phobia, there does appear to be some form of hierarchy between them: in the series finale [...] "Mr. Monk and the End", it is made clear that his fear of vomiting is greater than his fear of death. He has also stated, [...] "Snakes trump heights!".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Cover the Night" [...] event {{took place}} {{worldwide}} on April 20, 2012 and {{was to be}} conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, [...] "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family [...] in their neighborhoods." [...] One gathering in Vancouver had only 17 people; another in Brisbane had fewer than 50 attendees. In Kelowna, British Columbia several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were [...] "placed {{on both sides of}} the pedestrian overpass". In Canberra, several Facebook groups resulted in a few gatherings of two or three people each; Pierre Johannessen, a [...] "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city. In Phoenix, 200 posters were put up by [...] "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 2015, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) {{carried out}} a series of attacks in Jalisco and four of its {{adjacent}} states to prevent the capture of their suspected leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias [...] "El Mencho"). The operation began early <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Villa Purificación, where four Mexican Air Force and Federal Police helicopters spotted a CJNG convoy protecting El Mencho. As one of the helicopters flew over the convoy, the CJNG members shot it down using rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. 9 law enforcement officers {{died as a result of}} the attack, and multiple others were wounded. This incident was unprecedented in the Mexican Drug War since organized crime groups in Mexico had never successfully shot down an aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|He {{then drove}} {{across the border}} to Dublin, {{crossing}} the Boyne River at Oldbridge. The route had been well-rehearsed over the previous months. Billy Hanna, then the Mid-Ulster UVF's commander and the principal organiser of the attacks, accompanied him. At the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the Swords Road near Dublin Airport, the two men met up with {{the other members of the}} UVF bombing team. Jackson and Hanna subsequently transferred the bombs from his lorry into the boots of three allocated cars, which had been hijacked and stolen <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Belfast. The Hidden Hand producers named William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant of the UVF's A Coy, 1st Battalion Belfast Brigade, as having been on a Garda list of suspects as the organiser of the hijackings in Belfast on the morning of the bombings. The cars, after being obtained by the gang of hijackers, known as [...] "Freddie and the Dreamers", were driven from Belfast {{across the border to}} the carpark, retaining their original registration numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Phayer {{wrote in}} 2008 that, [...] "nearly all" [...] historians agree that Maglione did not protest the seize of <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> {{his meeting with}} von Weizsäcker. Nor did Pius XII ever speak {{publicly}} of the razzia. However, on October 25 (by which time most of the Jews who had been rounded up were probably already dead or soon to enter the gas chamber), L'Osservatore Romano ran an article saying that [...] "the Holy Father's charity was universal, extending to all races". According to Gilbert, following Maglione’s appeal, to protect Rome's remaining Jews from a possible German reversal, Pius gave instructions for the Vatican to be opened to the city's Jews, and for the convents and monasteries to provide hiding places, or provide false papers. Gilbert credits this papal initiative, with resulting in {{a larger percentage of}} the Jews of Rome being saved than were saved in any other city then under German occupation.|$|E
2500|$|Tiernan {{alleged that}} {{on the morning of}} 17 May 1974, Hanna and Jackson transported the bombs across the border into the Republic of Ireland in the latter's poultry lorry having {{retrieved}} them from James Mitchell's farm in Glenanne where they had been constructed and stored. After meeting up {{with the rest of the}} UVF bombing team at the Coachman's Inn pub carpark on the northern outskirts of Dublin, Hanna activated the bombs and then, along with Jackson, placed them into the three allocated cars' boots. The cars had been hijacked and stolen earlier <b>that</b> <b>morning</b> <b>in</b> Belfast by a local UVF gang known as [...] "Freddie and the Dreamers" [...] which was allegedly led by William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant. They were subsequently driven south and delivered to the bombing team at the carpark. Tiernan suggested that Hanna had been paranoid that the Gardaí would stop the cars at a checkpoint. He therefore ordered the drivers to travel to Dublin by separate routes, and to make sure that there was no police presence on the roads.|$|E
