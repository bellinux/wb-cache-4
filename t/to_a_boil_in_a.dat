40|$|On a rainy Sunday {{morning in}} a tough Miami {{neighborhood}} in the early 1970 s, seven-year-old Carl Hart was {{at home with his}} parents and five sisters. His mother was enjoying Al Green on the record player when, on an extension phone, she accidentally overheard Hart’s father talking to a lover. After heating maple syrup <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pot, his mom strode into the bedroom and heaved it at him. Hart’s father chased her outside, wearing only his Fruit of the Loom underwear. Had he not slipped on the wet grass, he may well have killed her. Instead, the incident permanently ended a marriage long fraught with conflict. No drugs were involved in this episode. Indeed, crack cocaine didn’t hit the streets until almost a decade after this occurred. And yet a national mythos has arisen whereby crack and other drugs have been repeatedly blamed for poverty, child neglect, unemployment, violence, {{and a host of other}} conditions in the African American community that often preceded the so-called crack epidemic chronologically and have less obvious causes.

Because of the dire state of the royalist finances, these Spanish mercenaries went often unpaid.

50|$|Sorghum beer {{is called}} bjala in {{northern}} Sotho and is traditionally made {{to mark the}} unveiling of a loved-one's tombstone. The task of making the beer falls traditionally to women. The process is begun several days before the party, when {{the women of the}} community gather together to bring the sorghum and water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> huge cast iron pots over open fires. After the mix has fermented for several days, it is strained - a somewhat labor-intensive task. Sorghum beer is known by many different names in various countries across Africa, including Umqombothi (South Africa) burukuto (Nigeria), pombe (East Africa) and bil-bil (Cameroon). African sorghum beer brewed using grain sorghum undergoes lactic acid fermentation, as well as alcoholic fermentation.|$|R

Protestant mobs attacked and killed at least twenty-two people. The rioting began at Shelby and Green Street (Liberty) and progressed through the city's East End. After burning houses on Shelby Street, the mob headed for William Ambruster's brewery in the triangle between Baxter Avenue and Liberty Street. They set the place ablaze and ten Germans died in the fire. When the mob burned Quinn's Irish Row on the North side of Main between Eleventh and Twelfth Streets, some tenants died in the fire; the mob shot and killed others.

50|$|Soy milk is {{made from}} whole {{soybeans}} or full-fat soy flour. The dry beans are soaked in water overnight or {{for a minimum of}} 3 hours or more depending on the temperature of the water. The rehydrated beans then undergo wet grinding with enough added water to give the desired solids content to the final product which has a protein content of 1 - 4%, depending on the method of production. The ratio of water <b>to</b> beans on <b>a</b> weight basis is 5:1 for traditional soy milk or 20:1 for soy beverages. The resulting slurry or purée is brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> improve its taste properties by heat inactivating soybean trypsin inhibitor, improve its flavor, and to sterilize the product.

Hamilton was scrutinized for making this statement before the team played in the tournament as the pressure it would put on the team may have been the deciding factor in their lopsided 30-point loss to the Wolverines the following day. On the Monday following the game Pearl was dismissed from Tennessee and not soon after Hamilton announced his resignation.

It also seeks to bring to life the remarkable politics of children’s representation, which came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> recent years. In addition to describing the AAML Standards, the article also describes two other recent efforts to define {{the role of a}} child 2 ̆ 7 s lawyer, one by the Uniform Law Commission and the other by the American Bar Association and then tells the story of why both of those efforts ultimately failed to garner significant support in the field. The article tells the fascinating story of how the Uniform Law Commission came to be defeated by children’s rights advocates and how the ABA effort came to be defeated by very different forces. The article concludes by attempting to identify common ground among all three efforts and to reconcile the competing visions of children’s advocacy shared by these three organizations. The article offers a vision of how best to use court-appointed aides to serve children and their families when the parents are enmeshed in contentious disputes over custody and visitation...|$|R

40|$|When {{the transatlantic}} trade dispute over genetically {{modified}} organisms came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>in</b> the late 1990 s and early 2000 s it was widely expected to be highly conflictual. The United States was, almost universally, expected to challenge fundamentally the European Union’s regulatory system for GMOs before the World Trade Organisation and was equally universally expected to win the case. The EU was widely, albeit not universally, expected to refuse {{to comply with the}} ruling. In keeping with most of the international political economy literature on trade disputes, both of these expectations were rooted in assessments of societal demands for action and resistance. Both expectations, however, were confounded; the US (and its co-complainants) filed a narrow challenge focusing on the EU’s failure to apply its own procedures; and the EU, somewhat falteringly, has resumed approvals of GMOs. Applying a two-level-game framework, this article argues that this relatively cooperative outcome is explained by the executives of both polities exercising their autonomy to pursue policies closer to the preferences of the other polity than their median domestic constituents would have preferred. This article, therefore, makes the case for taking government preferences and autonomy seriously when analysing the outcomes of trade disputes. Moreover, it emphasises that compliance with international rules engages with on-going internal policy processes and debate...|$|R

However, the valley is a religiously conservative region which was particularly hard-hit by President Karimov's secularization legislation in Uzbekistan, together with his decision to close the borders with Kyrgyzstan in 2003.

The first type occurs associated with sulphides (mainly pyrite), either as inclusions (10 – 30 μm) or as sub-microscopic gold. The second gold type consists of large gold grains (≥ 100 μm) within the silicates (mostly quartz). LA-ICP-MS studies reveal that some gold and associated sulphide grains contain high values of Cl, Br, Na, and I.
