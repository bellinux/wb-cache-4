50|$|Getter (1981) {{determined}} that the Key silverside has a restricted distribution and is only found in lagoonal and ponded waters of the Florida Keys. These ponds and lagoons are a relatively rare and a novel habitat, and are shared by a distinct community of fishes, many found nowhere else. The Key silverside is the smallest known species of Menidia, females reach 58 mm (standard length) and males 50 mm. While the Key silverside {{is closely related to}} (paraphyletic with) the <b>Tidewater</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia peninsulae) it is distinctly more deep bodied and yellow in color, restricted in range and habitat. It is also less cold tolerant in lab situations.|$|E
40|$|Growth {{rates of}} four fishes during 1982, a flood year, were {{compared}} to those of previous years by back calculation from scales and, for one species, by comparison with previous mean length measurements. Calculated growth increments in 1982 were significantly larger {{than in the previous}} years for blacktail shiner (Notropis venustus), smallmouth buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus), and <b>tidewater</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia beryllina). Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) did not exhibit increased growth rates in 1982. Two extreme flood events during and prior to the 1982 growing season are postulated to have been the cause of the observed changes in growth rates. These events caused large increases in the area flooded by the reservoir and in the allochthonous inputs to the reservoir. Decreased abundance of some fishes due to emigration via floodgates also occurred. The mechanism by which the flood events caused higher growth rates in some fishes is unknown, but may be related to a change in reservoir productivity due to increased inputs and/or to density-dependent growth in some fishes. Striped bass growth rates may have decreased in 1982 due to a winterkill of the threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense) population, which reduced prey availability...|$|E
40|$|Diel {{changes in}} the {{distribution}} of the <b>tidewater</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia beryllina) and its prey were measured in Clear Lake, California, a large, shallow, eutrophic lake. Zooplankton prey densities were low in the littoral zone, but increased rapidly to near peak abundances 50 - 200 m from shore. Gill netting, trawling, and visual observations showed that tidewater silversides migrated both horizontally and vertically to feed in areas of high zooplankton abundance. At night the fish concentrated near shore and did not feed. At dawn (8 x l 0 ^ 8 - 2 x l 0 ^ 10 photons cm- 2 nm- 1 s- 1) the fish migrated lakeward at least 50 - 1, 000 m, and littoral abundance decreased from more than 100 m- 2 to only 0. 1 m- 2. The migration preceded the initiation of feeding by 30 - 60 min. After feeding 2 - 4 h, the fish returned to the littoral zone and swam rapidly (6 - 11 body lengths s- 1) parallel to shore in narrow, continuous schools until resting aggregations formed. The fish returned to shore before they were satiated, perhaps to balance predation losses in offshore areas against foraging gains. A second period of offshore activity and feeding occurred in the afternoon and evening...|$|E
