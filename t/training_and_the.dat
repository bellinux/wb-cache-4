5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrival {{of hundreds of thousands}} of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class midget {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Alderson was placed in charge of the 1st Mounted Division and all troops in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk but was soon requested for command of the newly formed First Canadian Contingent due to his experience in South Africa commanding Canadian troops. Personally selected by Sir Sam Hughes, Canadian Minister of Militia, Alderson met the first shipments of Canadian troops in October and almost immediately came into conflict with their minister. Hughes had preceded his men and insisted that the Canadian contingent was not only fully trained and battle ready but also equipped with the best weaponry available. Alderson however saw his charges differently, commenting on the poor quality of the politically appointed officers, the low degree of <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> operational problems of the Ross rifle, a weapon personally approved by Hughes.|$|E

In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was one part of Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and <b>Training</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E
5|$|FALINTIL officially became F-FDTL on 1 February 2001. The first 650 {{members of}} the F-FDTL were {{selected}} from 1,736 former FALINTIL applicants and began training on 29 March.

The 2nd Battalion was established in 2002 from a cadre of the 1st Battalion and was manned mainly by new personnel {{under the age of}} 21 who had not participated in the independence struggle. Due to the force's prestige and relatively high pay, there were 7,000 applications for the first 267 positions in the battalion. The F-FDTL's small naval component was established in December 2001. The Australian UNTAET contingent provided most of the F-FDTL's <b>training,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States equipped the force.|$|E

5|$|Liddell's {{official}} debut for Liverpool came in {{the third}} round of the FA Cup, the first competitive football tournament to be organised in post-war England. He started in the first leg against Chester City on 5 January 1946 and scored in the 30th minute. The match ended in a 2–0 win and featured several additional debutants, including Bob Paisley, who would forge a chemistry with Liddell as a left half. League football completed its first full season under the provisional North and South divisional system, which facilitated the restoration of national football for the 1946–47 season. Although he established himself in the North League, scoring 17 goals in 42 matches, Liddell had yet to be discharged from the RAF and did not accompany Liverpool during its post-season tour of North America in May 1946. His unavailability extended to pre-season <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first two matches of the 1946–47 season. On 7 September, Liddell registered his first official league appearance and scored twice in a 7–4 defeat of Chelsea.|$|E
