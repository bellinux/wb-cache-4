40|$|International audienceThis article {{seeks to}} examine {{the role of the}} grammaticalization process in two “modal” structures: happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to.</b> The first part adopts a {{synchronic}} approach and, after considering some basic facts about the grammaticalization process, happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to,</b> it highlights the four main characteristics of the grammaticalization process, and examines them in relation to the structures under study. The second part adopts a diachronic point of view; research on the Corpus of Historical English and on The Complete Shakespeare’s Works provides an insight into the development of happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to.</b> The question of the degree of grammaticalization for these two structures will also be tackled, to reach the conclusion that even if happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> were created through a grammaticalization process, {{it can be argued that}} the process is incomplete, morphosyntactically speaking.
