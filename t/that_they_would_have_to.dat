On July 21, the court extended their pre-trial detention by a further six months.|$|E
5|$|Sue Bea Montgomery, who {{had served}} as an {{associate}} producer on Chillicothe, also tried to interest studios in working with them, but was met with indifference. She determined <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find greater success in independent filmmaking before anyone would take interest in them and introduced the three to Maurice Kanbar, a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in Chillicothe.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} estimated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait {{one month}} for rescue, {{and refused to}} allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E

5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make terms.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the master}} plan {{was passed by}} the Council of State. On 10 December 1992, Parliament {{approved}} advanced payment of tolls on the ferry, which were made effective from 1 January 1993. Ticket prices increased with between NOK10 and 12. This resulted in protests from the ferry employees who stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> collect the tolls which would remove their jobs; Norwegian Seafarers' Union representatives stated that they considered suing the state. Work on the development plan started in 1992. It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project's cost by NOK200 million. In May 1994, it was made subject to consultative statements.|$|E

5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|Examination of {{the radar}} array also allowed British {{scientists}} to conclude <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deploy a countermeasure that {{had recently been}} developed, code-named Window. Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British {{during the early years}} of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E
5|$|NSB assured {{passengers}} {{that the}} trains were more capable than their reputation, {{and that they}} would continue to be used on the Bergen Line. If an alternative was needed, NSB stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages. However, the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush-hour trains around Oslo, were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers. In October, NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line, because the use of multiple units was not flexible enough. With locomotive-hauled trains, it was possible for the company to add or remove just a single carriage, but with multiple units, it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient. While originally planned to be introduced in 2008, delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010.|$|E

5|$|The finals system meant <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{play their}} finals match in England against English Super League club Wigan. The Mariners shocked {{the club and}} the league by winning 22–18. That score line would again be {{repeated}} in the grand final qualifier against Australian club Cronulla, another match the Mariners were expected to lose. But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against {{the winners of the}} Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were blown away by the competition favourites. In what would be their final rugby league match as a club, the Mariners were down at half-time 26–4 and the final scoreline of 36–12 prevented the Mariners taking out a A$1 million prize.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 31, about 54 hours {{prior to}} landfall, the Government of Mexico issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo {{in the southern}} Baja California peninsula. A state of emergency was declared in five districts of Baja California Sur requested via the local government. In La Paz, residents rushed to get groceries before the stores closed and residents boarded up windows. In Los Cabos, residents frantically stocked up on supplies before the tropical cyclone struck. On August 31, civil defense authorities in Los Cabos announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> evacuate 20,000families from their homes. Officials urged a total of 10,000 people to evacuate from shacks. Most people evacuated; however, they feared that there items would be stolen if they had left. While they did struggle with evacuations, officials managed to evacuate 15,000 people living in hurricane prone areas. However, many people such as tourists and the poor failed to evacuate, though 2,000 foreigners did leave the Los Cobos area. On August 30, Robbie Berg from the National Hurricane Center noted that the hurricanes remnants may help fire relief in California and also interests Baja California should monitor {{the progress of the}} system.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the patrol}} boats of Squadron One were an {{essential}} part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970. Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be properly trained in its use. The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.|$|E

25|$|But the Royalist cavalry under Rupert, {{followed}} rapidly by Charles and {{the main}} body from Evesham, strained every nerve to head off Essex at Newbury. After a sharp skirmish on Aldbourne Chase on 18 September, they succeeded. On 19 September, the whole Royal army was drawn up, facing west, with its right on Newbury, and its left on Enborne Heath. Essex's men knew that evening <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> break through by force, there being no suggestion of surrender.|$|E

Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.|$|E
