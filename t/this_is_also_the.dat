5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> {{case for}} Belgian {{subjects}} until 28 April 2008, since Belgium denounced Chapter 1 of this treaty on such date. In a similar way, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> case for Luxembourgian subjects until 10 July 2009.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> first Super Bowl played {{outdoors}} on {{artificial turf}} (FieldTurf) since Super Bowl X (1976) at the Miami Orange Bowl.

5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more hilly terrain. The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river and the road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> location of a unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. The other half is listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E
5|$|Cars {{would be}} the final film worked on by Joe Ranft {{who died in a}} car {{accident}} a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008.

5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|However, Swelim's {{theory is}} not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann {{point out that}} during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with {{polished}} surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> case for the stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close {{to the end of the}} Third Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, he {{published}} The Rules of Sociological Method, a manifesto stating what sociology {{is and how}} {{it ought to be}} done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.|$|E
5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Kitchen Creek {{flows through}} the park's three glens, which the {{descriptions}} of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen. The falls are listed in order going upstream along Kitchen Creek, starting with the southernmost and ending at the northernmost in each glen. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> order in which a hiker would encounter the falls while traveling north along the creek on the Falls Trail.|$|E

5|$|Machine Head {{increased}} {{the complexity and}} technicality in their sound for the next album, The Blackening, which partially changes {{the sound of their}} first 5 albums in favor of a more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures and guitar riffs. Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> first Machine Head's record to include blast beats.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|Only one man {{has scored}} a hat-trick in a World Cup Final. Geoff Hurst scored three for England against West Germany in the 1966 Final. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> longest hat-trick to be {{completed}} - most time {{between the first and}} third goals. His first goal came at 10', while the second goals were in extra time at 98' and 120'.|$|E

5|$|Póvoa de Varzim's most {{relevant}} garden squares are Praça do Almada (19th century) and Praça Luiz de Camões (20th century). Near the A28 motorway, {{there are three}} small parks: Espaço Agros, Argivai Picnic Park (Parque de Merendas de Argivai), and Travessa de Calves Green Space. Espaço Agros is a private-sponsored park with 22 hectare in the former Anjo woodland. This woodland was damaged by the construction of high speed roads {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s. Agros kept the essential rural setting, with some landscaping and environmental improvements, including a small lake. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> location of the city-owned Picnic Park, used for Easter Monday picnics.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Alive or Just Breathing, Leach left the band for {{personal}} and health issues. Killswitch Engage quickly recruited Howard Jones to replace Leach. Jones would stay in the band for nearly ten years, until his departure in 2012, which prompted Leach to rejoin the band on the ten-year anniversary of Alive or Just Breathing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E
5|$|The briefest hat-trick to be {{completed}} - that is, the shortest time {{between the first and}} third goals - is the one by László Kiss in 1982 against El Salvador. He scored at 69', 72', and 76', making the time between his first and third 7 minutes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> only hat-trick scored by a substitute.|$|E
