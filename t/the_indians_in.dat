5|$|After retiring, Christopher {{moved to}} San Diego, {{where he lived}} with his wife and three children. In December 1950, Christopher {{underwent}} heart surgery, and afterward felt optimistic about the possibility of pitching again. After a tryout with <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> 1951, he joined the San Diego Padres for a salary of $1 a year. He spent several weeks training with the team, but was eventually released at the end of April, ending his comeback attempt.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} mounted between <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning {{joint operations}} between federal army troops and local frontier militia against <b>the</b> <b>Indians.</b> <b>In</b> April 1790, Scott raised {{a contingent of}} volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in {{what would become the}} U.S. state of Ohio. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior– nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet– led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August 27, 1790.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Minnesota, Rocco began playing {{professional}} baseball in 1935, and {{played in the}} minor leagues for the next eight years. In June 1943, he was promoted to the Cleveland Indians, and served as the team's everyday first baseman during the war years. After the war ended, Rocco played one more season with <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> 1946, then returned to the minor leagues. There, he played primarily in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) until 1952, retiring after attempting to play amateur baseball in Minnesota and being ruled ineligible.|$|E
5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby {{did not agree with}} some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a picket line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E

5|$|Details of the {{forthcoming}} peace treaty arrived late in 1782. The Ohio Country, the land that the British and Indians had successfully defended, had been signed away by Great Britain to the United States. The British had not consulted <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> the peace process, and the Indians were nowhere mentioned in the treaty's terms. For the Indians, the struggle with American settlers would resume in the Northwest Indian War, though this time without the assistance of their British allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Lemon {{became a}} scout for Cleveland. The next season, {{he became a}} coach with <b>the</b> <b>Indians.</b> <b>In</b> 1961, he joined the Philadelphia Phillies {{coaching}} staff. The California Angels hired him as their pitching coach for 1967–1968. In 1976, Lemon served as pitching coach for the AL champion New York Yankees. The Yankees were owned by Cleveland-area native George Steinbrenner {{and they had been}} the chief antagonists of the Cleveland Indians during Lemon's pitching years. In recognition of his election to the Hall of Fame, Lemon was named honorary captain of the AL team for the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Lemon {{was raised}} in California where he played high school {{baseball}} and was the state {{player of the year}} in 1938. At the age of 17, Lemon began his professional baseball career in the Cleveland Indians organization, with whom he played for his entire professional career. Lemon was called up to Cleveland's major league team as a utility player in 1941. He then joined the United States Navy during World War II and returned to <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> 1946.

In 1944 Gerardo Vega, of Costa Rica, {{was the first}} Latin-American native to pioneer when he began work in Panama. Regional committees overseeing various countries of Latin and South America were appointed. Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate {{a shift in the}} balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. Back in North America, the first all-Indian assembly in the Americas was first established in 1948 on <b>the</b> Omaha <b>Indian</b> Reservation at Macy, Nebraska. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. Shoghi Effendi then called for two international conventions to be held at April 1951; one was held in Panama City for the purpose of electing a regional National Spiritual Assembly ...|$|R

5|$|On November 19, 2003 {{he signed}} a one-year, $1.73 million {{contract}} with <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> order for the Indians to avoid salary arbitration with him.

5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, {{he stopped}} in Riobamba, {{where a group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> order to take their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a detailed study of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.|$|E

5|$|The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit {{to enforce}} the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial {{court held that the}} {{property}} rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including <b>the</b> <b>Indians.</b> <b>In</b> 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, {{but the rest of the}} province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski returned to <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> 1921, {{and throughout the}} season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees {{to move out of}} first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
