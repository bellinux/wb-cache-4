He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get so many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> hear.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E

While he follows the Red Queen's every order, {{he is the}} only one capable of calming her {{dramatic}} mood swings. Glover said, [...] "The Red Queen has a fair amount of short-tempered reactions to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> do, and so [...] has to be quite diplomatic." [...] The Red Queen believes that the Knave of Hearts is her lover, but this proves to be false.|$|E

[...] According to Rolling Stone, the song's lyrics [...] "aptly reflects the quiet nature of the film" [...] and Shields has said that both he and Reitzell were [...] "under the influence of the film" [...] while Shields composed the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{exception}} here is {{the case}} of Western science, which seemingly rose in cultural appeal despite being unpopular with establishment forces. Russell explains the popularity of science is not grounded on a general respect for reason, but rather is grounded entirely on the fact that science produces technology, and technology produces <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> desire. Similarly, religion, advertising, and propaganda all have power because of their connections with the desires of their audiences. Russell's conclusion is that reason has very limited, though specific, sway over the opinions of persons. For reason is only effective when it appeals to desire. (Russell 1938:111–112) ...|$|E

According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also teach you how to deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt."

500|$|Lynch is an {{advocate}} {{for health care reform}} but split with his party on Obama's health care reform efforts. He voted in November 2009 to pass the Affordable Health Care for America Act (AHCAA), the House's health care reform bill. This bill was scrapped by Congressional leaders in favor of the Senate's bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Despite pressure from Obama and Democratic leaders, Lynch stated that he would oppose the PPACA until [...] "they put reform back in the health reform bill." [...] He described the Senate bill as a [...] "surrender" [...] to insurance companies, putting too little pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs, and that did not represent meaningful reform. He explained, [...] "There's a difference between compromise and surrender, right? And this is a complete surrender of all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> thought were important to health care reform." [...] When the PPACA came to a House vote in March 2010, he was the only U.S. representative from New England to vote against it.|$|E

Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's one of those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, {{and there were a}} lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s one of those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking.

500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take all of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but {{had been part of the}} touring band since 2006.|$|E
