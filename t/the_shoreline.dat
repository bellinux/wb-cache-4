5|$|Bird life on <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> {{includes}} yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds. Mangrove cuckoos, {{a notoriously}} difficult-to-observe species, {{may be seen}} at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne {{has one of the}} largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida.|$|E
50|$|Venice 13 was {{involved}} in an intense battle with <b>the</b> Venice <b>Shoreline</b> Crips during <b>the</b> 1990s. The conflict escalated and in {{one point in time}} Venice 13 and the Culver City gang went as far as to set aside their own fight to unite against <b>the</b> <b>Shorelines.</b> In 1994 Venice 13 and <b>the</b> <b>Shorelines</b> bargained for a cease fire, after a war that left 55 people dead and many more wounded.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{sea level}} rising and the {{strength}} of <b>the</b> tides, <b>the</b> <b>shoreline’s</b> sandstones erode. Erosion causes sediment of sand, pebbles, and mud to be washed up and down the Cobequid Bay with the incoming and outgoing tides. The sediment forms sand bars along <b>the</b> <b>shorelines,</b> {{as well as in the}} Shubenacadie River.|$|R
50|$|The town is {{generally}} rolling near <b>the</b> <b>shorelines</b> and mountainous in the hinterland with some patches of flat land {{located within the}} mangroves near <b>the</b> <b>shorelines.</b> It borders Buug to the north-east; Diplahan to the north-west; Imelda to the west; Margosatubig, Zamboanga del Sur, to the east; and Alicia to the south.|$|R
5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be very effective in attacking land-based units close to <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near <b>the</b> <b>shoreline).</b>|$|E
5|$|North of {{downtown}} Port Huron, US25 followed Pine Grove Avenue {{to the eastern}} terminus of M-136 and then followed 24th Avenue out of town. South of Lakeport, the highway changed names to Lakeshore Road and ran along the Lake Huron shoreline in The Thumb region of the state. US25 stayed close to <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> and passed Lakeport State Park {{in the town of}} the same name. North of the park, the highway crossed into southern Sanilac County and followed <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> to the community of Lexington where it intersected the eastern end of M-90. Further north, the highway intersected the eastern end of M-46 in Port Sanilac.|$|E
5|$|October 1-4, 2015 - Hurricane Joaquin briefly {{threatens to}} {{approach}} or strike the New York metropolitan area, forcing New Jersey and New York to begin storm preparations.

40|$|The {{existence}} of features indicative of shorelines of ancient oceans on Mars {{has been proposed}} for several authors. In this chapter we revise the topography of possible Martian paleoshorelines, and their consequences {{for the amount of}} water infilling ocean basins when water load is considered. We show that a re-evaluation of paleoshorelines is need. For example, <b>the</b> putative Meridiani <b>shoreline</b> could be <b>the</b> same feature as some portions of <b>the</b> Arabia <b>shoreline.</b> Indeed, elevations in <b>the</b> Meridiani <b>shoreline</b> are roughly similar to that of <b>the</b> Arabia <b>shoreline</b> in northeast Arabia, Utopia (not taken into account the Isidis basin), Elysium, and Amazonis regions. This is still far of an equipotential surface, but a paleoshoreline through these regions and the Meridiani horeline would be better candidate to represent a paleoequipotential surface than <b>the</b> Arabia <b>shoreline</b> sensu strito. Moreover, the elevation of <b>the</b> Arabia <b>shoreline</b> in northern Arabia Terra after is intriguingly close to the mean elevation of <b>the</b> Deuteronilus <b>shoreline,</b> and it cannot be discarded a “mixed” Arabia/Deuteronilus shoreline, which would include <b>the</b> Arabia <b>shoreline</b> in northern Arabia Terra, and <b>the</b> Deuteronilus <b>shoreline</b> elsewhere...|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> Calumet <b>Shoreline</b> is <b>the</b> oldest visible <b>shoreline</b> of Lake Michigan. [...] It is {{a visible}} sand ridge along Ridge Road through Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana.

5|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions to illuminate <b>the</b> <b>shoreline.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on Main Street {{into and}} through the {{downtown}} business district. The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BLI-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near {{the headquarters of the}} Whirlpool Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196/US31. <b>The</b> <b>shoreline</b> roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US31. This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> mangrove swamp, {{the shallow}} waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. <b>The</b> <b>shoreline</b> swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

50|$|Leading {{into the}} 1990s gunfire was heard nightly as <b>the</b> <b>Shorelines</b> warred with rival Culver City 13 after Shoreline cliques were {{pushed out of}} the Mar Vista Gardens projects. Shortly after, Oakwood {{exploded}} as a war broke out between <b>the</b> <b>Shorelines</b> and Venice 13 {{over control of the}} Venice drug trade until a cease-fire was arranged between the two gangs. In the 1980s and 1990s, when newly arrived white homeowners took residency in and around the area, causing Los Angeles to combat the gang problem. Although even after a series of raids, injunctions, and other measures against them, <b>the</b> <b>Shorelines</b> have maintained a steady control over their territory with their numbers ranging in the several hundreds.|$|R
50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} late 19th century to explain <b>the</b> <b>shorelines</b> uplifted in Scandinavia due to the removal of large ice massed during the last glaciation.

5|$|Cultures of {{indigenous}} peoples occupied <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, {{taking advantage of the}} rich resources. The Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township, Pennsylvania west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas, {{as well as from the}} Early and Middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor's {{woodlands}} sometimes reach <b>the</b> <b>shoreline,</b> especially between Porlock and Foreland Point, {{where they}} form the single longest stretch of coastal woodland in England and Wales.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s England was at peace and Pendennis was neglected; {{reportedly}} the garrison's pay {{was two years}} in arrears, forcing them to gather limpets from <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> for food. Nonetheless, a new Italian-styled gatehouse {{was added to the}} castle, probably in 1611. War with Spain broke out again 1624 and a new defensive line, with bastions and artillery, was built across the peninsula in 1627.|$|E

5|$|Point Loma {{is noted}} for {{neighborhood}} Christmas decorations. Several blocks of Garrison Street near Chatsworth are particularly {{well known for}} elaborate decorations. There is also a neighborhood-wide lighting of luminarias on Christmas Eve in the Plumosa Park area. On two Sundays in December there is a Parade of Lights, with brightly decorated boats sailing on the Bay to be viewed from <b>the</b> <b>shoreline.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Animikie Basin, {{measuring}} 700 x 400km (420mi x 240mi), is {{an elongated}} oval straddling the North Shore of Lake Superior, mainly in Minnesota. Approximately the northwestern two-thirds lies {{to the northwest}} of the shoreline; the southeastern third lies to the southeast of <b>the</b> <b>shoreline</b> (so is under Lake Superior's waters).|$|E
5|$|The area {{contains}} many marinas for boating and fishing enthusiasts such the Bayland Park Marina (Baytown) and the Watergate Yachting Center (Clear Lake Shores).Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57. <b>The</b> <b>shoreline</b> of Clear Lake itself {{has the greatest}} concentration of recreational boats in Texas and ranks third nationwide (Watergate even {{claims to be the}} nation's largest).|$|E
