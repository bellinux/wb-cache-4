The palace has four sides and eight corners with its lower and upper tiers adorned with jewels. The courtyard with four enclosures is said to represent four kinds of conduct.

5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, {{whether or not they}} are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by <b>the</b> <b>ambience</b> and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven <b>the</b> <b>ambience</b> of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
40|$|Current {{lighting}} technologies provide huge {{flexibility in}} creating ambiences {{that may be}} adapted {{to the needs of}} an occupant in a room. These ambiences not only satisfy visual needs, but may also improve people’s well-being. This paper describes one possible application of adaptable light ambiences, namely to counteract negative mood states that older people often experience in care centres. To this end, we wanted to create a pleasant, relaxing ambience to counteract anxiousness and a pleasant, activating ambience to counteract sadness. We asked 15 (relatively young) lighting designers to create these ambiences and averaged their input to create both ambiences in a real room. Subsequently, these ambiences were evaluated with the Atmosphere questionnaire by younger and older participants. The affective connotation of <b>the</b> <b>ambiences</b> in terms of the Atmosphere dimensions was well recognized by the younger participants but significantly less so by the older people. Hence, a photo interview with older people was used to make <b>the</b> <b>ambiences</b> more appropriate for them. A final validation experiment confirmed that the affective connotation of these new ambiences was well recognized by the older people...|$|R

Using intelligence, these ambiences may instantly be adapted {{to the needs of}} the room’s occupant(s), possibly improving their well-being. We hypothesized that ambiences with a clearly recognizable, positive affective meaning could be used to effectively mitigate negative mood in elderly. After inducing a sad mood with a short movie one group of elderly was immersed in a positive high arousing (i. e., activating) ambience, and another group in a neutral ambience. Similarly, after inducing anxiety with a short movie one group of elderly was immersed in a pleasant low arousing (i. e., cozy) ambience, and another group in a neutral <b>ambience.</b> We monitored <b>the</b> evolution of the mood of the four groups of elderly over a period of ten minutes after the mood induction, with both self-reported mood measurements (every 2 minutes) and constant measurements of the skin conductance response (SCR) and electrocardiography (ECG).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{multidisciplinary}} work, {{we propose}} a practical framework {{to study the}} variability of subjective responses to identical luminous ambiences (atmosphere). We focus {{on the influence of}} personality dimensions. Architects build spaces for which they define functional characteristics and an esthetical concept, while considering <b>the</b> quality of <b>ambiences.</b> <b>The</b> success of a building depends on the subjective perceptions and the behavioural responses of users regarding these functionalities and ambiences. In most works on <b>ambiences,</b> <b>the</b> user is generally considered as an "average user " (mister anybody). The importance and variability of the subjective character of responses has often been mentioned. However, we still do not have effective indicators on the relationship between personalities and the sensations of comfort and pleasure in a luminous <b>ambience.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of this work is therefore to study the relationship between the perceptivo-cognitive handling of luminance and chromaticities and the way social spaces are occupied and used depending on their luminous <b>ambience.</b> We study <b>the</b> behaviour of subjects in a laboratory and on sites (in rest areas). At the same time, we study <b>the</b> luminous <b>ambiences</b> in these areas...|$|R

Numerous studies and artistic works resulted thenceforth. In order to describe the nature, composition and process of ambience formation in city representations, I will discuss selected paradigms in architecture, cartography and painting. I will argue that although commonly <b>the</b> property of <b>ambience</b> is assigned to aesthetic –such such as paintings– and not operational representations, this is not entirely true. In <b>the</b> contrary, <b>ambience</b> is a property of both types of representation, formed by a collaboration of their emotional and intellectual attributes...|$|R
