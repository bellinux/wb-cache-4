5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric.

In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1990s, NSB had {{initiated}} {{a program to}} replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> sixteen Class 73 four-car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line. To supplement this, the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines. The choice fell on Class 93, with fifteen units eventually delivered. This allowed all passenger trains on diselized lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4. The last Di 3-hauled train ran on 7 January 2001.|$|E

In particular, the aging Di3 locomotives would be retired within five years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains. The failure of the Di6, which were returned to the manufacturer Siemens, further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
