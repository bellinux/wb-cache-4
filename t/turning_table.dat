40|$|Abstract: B 4 C/CNTs and B 4 C/Ccomposites were {{prepared}} by reaction-sintering technique. The density and porosity {{of the samples}} were determined and three-points bending strengths of the composites were measured. Wear resistance tests were performed using a HT- 500 pin-on-disc tribometer with the sample placed horizontally on a <b>turning</b> <b>table.</b> The morphology of the worn surfaces and fracture of the composites were examined by means of scanning electron microscopy so as to explore the wear mechanisms. The results indicate that B 4 C/CNTs composites show improved friction and wear properties as compared with B 4 C/C composites. It is found that CNTs in the specimens play important role in improving the wear properties of the composites. The wear mechanism of the B 4 C/CNTs composites is characterized by micro-cutting and plowing at ambient temperature, and sub-surface cracking and the resultant localized spalling on the worn surface at the temperatures higher than 500 °C...|$|E
40|$|As a {{step towards}} systems that can acquire {{knowledge}} automatically we have designed {{a system that}} can learn new objects {{with a minimum of}} user interaction and implemented it on our robot platform GripSee [1]. A novel object is placed into the robot's gripper in order to define a default orientation and a default grip.

A user interface that can correct errors in the representation is also part of the system. The visual representation is complemented by a grip library, which contains possible ways of grasping and manipulating the object in a robust manner.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{dependence of}} gravitational constant G is {{measured at the}} millimeter scale to test the weak equivalence principle, which may be violated at short range through new Yukawa interactions such as the dilaton exchange force. A torsion balance on a <b>turning</b> <b>table</b> with two identical tungsten targets surrounded by two different attractor materials (copper and aluminum) is used to measure gravitational torque by means of digital measurements of a position sensor. Values of the ratios G̃_Al-W/G̃_Cu-W - 1 and G̃_Cu-W/G_N - 1 were (0. 9 ± 1. 1 _sta± 4. 8 _sys) × 10 ^- 2 and (0. 2 ± 0. 9 _sta± 2. 1 _sys) × 10 ^- 2, respectively; these were obtained at a center to center separation of 1. 7 cm and surface to surface separation of 4. 5 mm between target and attractor, {{which is consistent with}} the universality of G.

40|$|Idiomatic {{expression}} {{is the one}} of the unique aspect in language, because it cannot be understood word by word. Therefore, the language learners should know and understand the meaning about that idiomatic expression. Idiomatic expressions oftentimes used by song writer to make their song more interesting and drive the listener to be main character in that song; such as in AdeleÂ’s album Â“ 21 Â”. Because of the difficulty in knowing idiomatic expressionÂ’s meaning constantly, researcher is interested to analyze: 1) What are the idiomatic expressions found in AdeleÂ’s album Â“ 21 Â”, 2) What are the contextual meanings of idiomatic expressions found in AdeleÂ’s album Â“ 21 Â” The research design of this study is descriptive qualitative. The object of this study is AdeleÂ’s album Â“ 21 Â” that is consisted eleven songs. Researcher chosen eight songs to be analyzed; they are Rolling in the Deep, Rumour has It, <b>Turning</b> <b>Table,</b> Set Fire to the Rain, He wonÂ’t Go, Take It All, IÂ’ll be Waiting, and Someone Like You. As a human instrument, the researcher of this study was also downloaded song lyric to help in drawing about what type and contextual meaning of idiomatic expressions. In this research, the researcher found six types of idiomatic expression; they are two-word verbs, prepositional phrase, proverbial phrase, noun phrase, idiomatic verbal expression Â‘be + Adjective phraseÂ’, and pairs of verbs. The contextual meaning of the whole song in AdeleÂ’s album Â“ 21 Â” is about her anger, sacrifice, disappointed, un-moved on until finally she can let her ex-boyfriend and their bittersweet memories have already over...|$|E
40|$|With ISAR (Invers Synthetic Aperture Radar) Imaging, {{we refer}} to a radar imaging {{technique}} able to generate two – dimensional high quality electromagnetic images of a target. The main difference {{with respect to the}} SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) techninque is that the target is not cooperative with the system, thus, its motion, instead of the transceiver motion, creates the synthetic aperture of the radar antenna. The ISAR radars have a significant roles in surveillance scenarios, because they allow to obtain sufficiently high quality images for target recognition purposes. In situations where a normal radar display a single bright moving pixel on a screen, an ISAR image allows to discriminate between various target, such as missiles, military and civilian aircrafts and boats. In the last years, the exploitation of others non – cooperative transmitters as Illuminators of Opportunity (IOOs) for radar application is become really important for many reasons, such as the unnecessary need of a dedicated transmitter, which significantly reduces the implementation costs. In case of military surveillance applications, the passive radar geometry of the system allows to get advantages in terms of RCS (Radar Cross Section), because a stealth target that is shaped to minimize its monostatic RCS may nevertheless have a higher bistatic RCS. In this thesis work a DVB – S/S 2 based passive ISAR radar is analyzed. The DVB – S and DVB – S 2 (Second Generation) are the main standards for the television broadcastings using the geosynchronous satellites. These satellites are particularly interesting for the usage as illuminators of opportunity because, being geosynchronous over the Equator, they are always available and able to cover with their footprints a big area of the Earth surface. After a short introduction about the general passive radar theory, the main characteristics of the DVB – S 2 standard are explained, with a particular focus on the deterministic components contained into the signal that can cause some problems during the detection procedure. In the third chapter, the ISAR imaging theory is explained, in particular the case of a bistatic configuration. Since we are interested in radar applications of these satellites, four different Ambiguity Functions will be presented, considering four different spectrum configurations of the signal. The evaluation of the performances in terms of range resolution and side lobe level (SLL) will be done. Since this work is oriented on the evaluation of the possibility to obtained ISAR images using these satellites, a <b>turning</b> <b>table</b> has been used during the tests: this geometry allows the biggest aspect angle variation between the target and the radar. In the fourth chapter the system, developed by the Fraunhofer FHR Institute, is introduced, evaluating the strong points and the main limitations. A case study to evaluate the efficiency of the system is presented. In the fifth and final chapter, the experimental results are shown, in particular the ISAR images obtained using different image formation techniques. These images will be processed also with a Compressive Sensing technique to demonstrate the effectiveness of it in the grating lobes cancellation...|$|E
