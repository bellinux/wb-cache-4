5|$|Being saprobic, P. flammans {{is found}} {{exclusively}} on dead and decaying stumps and trunks of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in tufts or singly, from summer to autumn.

It is found throughout Europe (from the British Isles <b>to</b> <b>Russia)</b> <b>and</b> North America (southern Canada and the United States). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India and China.|$|E

5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Although the Commonwealth nobility quickly elected Sigismund's son Władysław IV Vasa as their new ruler, Poland's neighbours, expecting delays in the electoral process, tested the Commonwealth's {{perceived}} weakness.

5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} <b>to</b> <b>Russia,</b> <b>and</b> parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly positive. The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff noted his {{enjoyment}} of the storyline, but he mostly enjoyed the episode's inclusion and voice work of Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd. He also commented favorably on the gags that describe Russia as filled with bears on unicycles and that Adam West {{turns out to be}} the Russian sleeper agent. He criticized the improv comedy storyline, and commented that improv troupes and 1980s comedies are lazy targets. He graded the episode a B, tying with The Simpsons and American Dad!, and beating its spin-off The Cleveland Show. IGN Television critic Ahsan Haque gave the episode a mixed review, stating that he did not like the improv storyline, and he was not amused with Peter's usage of Joe's American flag as toilet paper. However, he praised the scene that involved Stewie's, Brian's, Chevy Chase's, and Dan Aykroyd's travel <b>to</b> <b>Russia,</b> <b>and</b> he ultimately gave the episode 7.7 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|The first Native Americans {{to become}} Orthodox were the Aleuts living {{in contact with}} Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century. They had been baptized mostly by their Orthodox trading {{partners}} or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy. Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov. Shelikhov's attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population. He returned <b>to</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> installed Alexandr Baranov {{as director of the}} colony. In order to convince the Russian imperial court of the seriousness of his colonial ambitions, Shelikhov recruited volunteers from the Valaam, an environment that appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago's landscape, and Konevitsa monasteries to travel to the new colony.|$|E
5|$|After the prewar Communist Party of Poland was {{eliminated}} in Stalin's purges in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought <b>to</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> killed), {{a group of}} survivors, led by Marceli Nowotko, Bolesław Mołojec and Paweł Finder, convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow {{of the need to}} reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, Władysław Gomułka emerged as the PPR's First Secretary by the end of 1943. Gomułka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish leftist movement, who loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and Ukraine in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938–39. Throughout the German occupation, Gomułka remained in Poland and was {{not a part of the}} Moscow-reared Stalin's Polish circle. In Polish society of 1945, Gomułka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.|$|E

5|$|Commander Matsumura Junzō {{arrived in}} London on 21 July and gave Reed the {{specifications}} for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded {{the amount allocated}} in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart for a trip <b>to</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and {{did not include the}} armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes <b>to</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar's dual {{proposal}} for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable <b>to</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press {{they could no longer}} publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. Unfortunately, an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a short trip to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.|$|E
