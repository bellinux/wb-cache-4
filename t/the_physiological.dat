5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup {{of carbon dioxide and}} lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E

Many of these nutrients are known to play important functional roles within the gut, brain, {{and elsewhere in the}} body; the functions of other components are still being elucidated.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} {{imbalance}} of brain metal homeostasis {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. <b>The</b> <b>physiological</b> implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E
5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and in silico.

By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

5|$|The {{external}} morphology of Lepidoptera is <b>the</b> <b>physiological</b> {{structure of}} the bodies of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera, also known as butterflies and moths. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders {{by the presence of}} scales on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from microlepidoptera only a few millimetres long, to a wingspan of many inches such as the Atlas moth. Comprising over 160,000 described species, the Lepidoptera possess variations of the basic body structure which has evolved to gain advantages in adaptation and distribution.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>physiological</b> {{function}} of the AH receptor {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal physiological function.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>physiological</b> {{function}} of the prion protein remains a controversial matter.
