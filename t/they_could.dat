5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> direct the movement of clouds.|$|E
