5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew.

Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity.

On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E
5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to do something to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army.

Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E

Kate tells him {{she wants to make}} sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain.
