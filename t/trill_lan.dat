40|$|The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) {{protocol}} provides optimal pair-wise data forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding {{even during}} periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called Routing Bridges (RBridges). TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can have multiple end stations and RBridges attached. This document describes four aspects of the <b>TRILL</b> <b>LAN</b> Hello protocol used on such links, particularly adjacency, designated RBridge selection, and MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) and pseudonode procedures, with state machines. There is no change for IS-IS point-to-point Hellos used on links configured as point-to-point in TRILL. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.

40|$|The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) {{protocol}} provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology, safe forwarding {{even during}} periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called "RBridges " (Routing Bridges). <b>TRILL</b> supports multi-access <b>LAN</b> (Local Area Network) links that can have multiple end stations and RBridges attached. Where multiple RBridges are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end stations on that link is handled by a subset of those RBridges called "Appointed Forwarders", with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN (Virtual LAN) be handled by at most one RBridge. The purpose of this document {{is to improve the}} documentation of the Appointed Forwarder mechanism; thus, it updates RFC 6325. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.
