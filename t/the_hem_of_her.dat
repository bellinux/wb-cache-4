5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> red dress {{in a manner that}} recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
500|$|Izabel: Izabel is {{the ghost}} of a teenage girl from the planet Cleave who was killed by a landmine. She manifests as a reddish torso with her {{intestines}} hanging out from under <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> T-shirt. She comes from a family of resistance fighters who built tunnels to escape people who invaded Cleave. She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, but to do so has to bond her soul to Hazel's. Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this, she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel's presence since she can act as a [...] "babysitter" [...] at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest. She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance, although these do not work on machines such as the Robots.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} year, Rix Nicholas created {{one of her}} most {{extraordinary}} works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost [...] high, and [...] wide, Les fleurs dédaignées ('The despised flowers') is an [...] "unnerving" [...] and [...] "arresting" [...] portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was [...] "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: ...|$|E
50|$|The local {{image of}} the Virgin Mary under the titular of the Immaculate Conception {{is known as the}} Nuestra Señora del Aguas Santas (also Virgin of the Holy Waters). The image of Immaculate Concepcion was said to be miraculous. Some of the miracles {{includes}} the wetting of the Virgin’s robes up to the shoulders, amor seco growing from <b>the</b> <b>hems</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garments and mysterious footprints all over the church leading to her altar. Due to the popular devotion to the Virgin and miracles attributed to her, the church is currently petitioning to become a diocesan shrine.|$|R

500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has heard of such a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E

2500|$|According to Rosemarie Bodenheimer, North and South {{narrative}} {{may sometimes}} appear melodramatic and sentimental ("But, for all that—for all his savage words, {{he could have}} thrown himself at her feet, and kissed <b>the</b> <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garment" [...] in chapter 29)—particularly in the riot scene—but she sees Gaskell's best writing as [...] "done with the unjudging openness to experience" [...] Which the author shares with D. H. Lawrence (Bodenheimar 1979, pp.296–300). Jill L. Matus finds Gaskell's vocabulary [...] "Gothicized" [...] in its descriptions of the characters' agonised inner life—their responses to suffering and pain—which may appear melodramatic out of context. [...] However, [...] "the language of shock and horror is absorbed into the realist texture of the novel's narration" [...] and {{is consistent with the}} extreme conditions of the novel's external world (Matus, 2007, p.39).|$|E

[...] Then she {{gathered}} up her things {{as though she had}} been ill-treated in being driven to make so sudden a retreat, and Martha, as soon as <b>the</b> last <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mistress's dress had become invisible on the stairs, opened the front door for the visitors.|$|R
60|$|The portress {{had already}} heard the report, {{and opened her}} wicket even before the bell could be rung, then eagerly ushered him into the parlour, the barest and most ascetic-looking of rooms, with a boarded {{partition}} across, unenlivened except by a grated hollow, and the outer portion empty, save of a table, three chairs, and a rugged woodcut of a very tall St. Ursula, with a crowd of pigmy virgins, not reaching higher than <b>the</b> ample <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> petticoat.|$|R
60|$|She entered--a {{noble and}} {{commanding}} figure, the long white veil, {{in which she}} was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the elegance and majesty <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shape. Her demeanour was that of respect, unmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate favour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to the feelings, of others. She arose, and would have conducted her lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again intimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady <b>of</b> Ivanhoe, <b>her</b> fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowena's resistance, kissed <b>the</b> embroidered <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tunic.|$|R

6000|$|The September {{moon was}} up and shining clearly over garden, lawn, and sea, when the sound <b>of</b> voices called <b>her</b> down. At the stair-foot she paused with a {{disappointed}} air, for only one hat lay on the hall table, and a glance showed her only one guest with Mark and Prue. She strolled irresolutely through the breezy hall, looked out at either open door, sung a little to herself, but broke off {{in the middle of}} a line, and, as if following a sudden impulse, went out into the mellow moonlight, forgetful of uncovered head or dewy damage to <b>the</b> white <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown. Half way down the avenue she paused before a shady nook, and looked in. The evergreens that enclosed it made the seat doubly dark to eyes inured to the outer light, and seeing a familiar seeming figure sitting with its head upon its hand, Sylvia leaned in, saying, with a daughterly caress-- ...|$|R

60|$|Robert--perhaps {{aware that}} Caroline's glance had wandered towards and dwelt upon him, {{though he had}} neither met nor {{answered}} it--put down the book of engravings, and approaching, took a seat at her side. She resumed her conversation with Louis, but while she talked to him her thoughts were elsewhere. Her heart beat on the side from which her face was half averted. She acknowledged a steady, manly, kindly air in Louis; but she bent before the secret power of Robert. To be so near him--though he was silent, {{though he did not}} touch so much as her scarf-fringe or <b>the</b> white <b>hem</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress--affected her like a spell. Had she been obliged to speak to him only, it would have quelled, but, at liberty to address another, it excited her. Her discourse flowed freely; it was gay, playful, eloquent. The indulgent look and placid manner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> auditor encouraged her to ease; the sober pleasure expressed by his smile drew out all that was brilliant in her nature. She felt that this evening she appeared to advantage, and as Robert was a spectator, the consciousness contented her. Had he been called away, collapse would at once have succeeded stimulus.|$|R

[...] Big Sean's appearance on [...] "Best Mistake" [...] also got varied reception. Pitchfork Media's Meaghan Garvey said his rap on the track made [...] "a mockery of the song's serious tone with hysterically awful lines like [...] "How can we keep the feelings fresh/ How do we Ziploc it?"" [...] Lipshutz found his verse [...] "unnecessary, yet [...] has morphed into an interesting confessional now that the dating rumors are on." [...] Sawdey called it a [...] "pretty outstanding verse," [...] with [...] "his own voice never overpowering the sparse atmosphere, his rhymes measured and metered in a way that fits the song perfectly", while James Shotwell of Under the Gun Review said [...] "Grande is a treat, but I think it's Big Sean who steals the show." ...|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, here come whole tribes {{of people whose}} {{physical}} lives are but a deteriorated variety of life, and themselves a meaner species of mankind; so sad an effect has been wrought by the tainted breath of cities, scanty and unwholesome food, destructive modes of labor, {{and the lack of}} those moral supports that might partially have counteracted such bad influences. Behold here a train of house painters, all afflicted with a peculiar sort of colic. Next in place we will marshal those workmen in cutlery, who have breathed a fatal disorder into their lungs with the impalpable dust of steel. Tailors and shoemakers, being sedentary men, will chiefly congregate into one part of the procession and march under similar banners of disease; but among them we may observe here and there a sickly student, who has left his health between the leaves of classic volumes; and clerks, likewise, who have caught their deaths on high official stools; and men of genius too, who have written sheet after sheet with pens dipped in their heart's blood. These are a wretched quaking, short-breathed set. But what is this cloud of pale-cheeked, slender girls, who disturb the ear with the multiplicity of their short, dry coughs? They are seamstresses, who have plied the daily and nightly needle in the service of master tailors and close-fisted contractors, until now it is almost time for each to <b>hem</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own shroud. Consumption points their place in the procession. With their sad sisterhood are intermingled many youthful maidens who have sickened in aristocratic mansions, and for whose aid science has unavailingly searched its volumes, and whom breathless love has watched. In our ranks the rich maiden and the poor seamstress may walk arm in arm. We might find innumerable other instances, where the bond of mutual disease--not to speak of nation-sweeping pestilence--embraces high and low, and makes the king a brother of the clown. But {{it is not hard to}} own that disease is the natural aristocrat. Let him keep his state, and have his established orders of rank, and wear his royal mantle of the color of a fever flush and let the noble and wealthy boast their own physical infirmities, and display their symptoms as the badges of high station. All things considered, these are as proper subjects of human pride as any relations of human rank that men can fix upon.|$|R
