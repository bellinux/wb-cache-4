5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that had <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric {{is said to have}} done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
5|$|By 1071, Robert, {{together}} with his brother Roger, had <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, Bari. By the next year, they conquered all of Sicily, ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily. In 1073, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert's daughter Helena. Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople. However, in 1078, Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates, an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne. This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated; however, his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy.|$|E

5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.

The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they had <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, {{and there was no}} storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
