Using the structural equation modeling method, latent growth modeling was utilized to assess four age cohorts of sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen years of age at the first wave. The data indicated that <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> delinquency significantly and positively affects <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> alcohol-impaired driving for the respondents who were sixteen at the first wave. <b>The</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> drinking was also significantly and positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> alcohol-impaired driving for this age cohort. Although <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> delinquency had no significant effect on <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> alcohol-impaired driving for the age cohort which was seventeen at Wave 1, <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rates <b>of</b> both drinking and drug use did affect for this age cohort. The data, however, showed that alcohol-impaired driving had a significant increase across the waves for the eighteen year old cohort, {{but there was no}} significant variation in the rate across respondents. Finally, for the nineteen year old cohort there was no significant increase in alcohol-impaired driving across the waves, and also no significant variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> rate <b>of</b> alcohol-impaired driving across the respondents.

Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages.
