25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him <b>think</b> <b>very</b> differently.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Lord Richard {{was one of}} a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole scheme of things, but it was the {{identity}} of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Lord Richard was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people <b>think</b> <b>very</b> hard about the wisdom of it.|$|E

25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I <b>think</b> <b>very</b> appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the Imperial Review in November 1805 stated, [...] "something should {{be said of the}} language. This undoubtedly is not its chief excellence.

The author seldoms avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we <b>think</b> <b>very</b> highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little artificial colouring, and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the last we can love." ...|$|E

He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The results of that study were extremely promising and I <b>think</b> <b>very</b> surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how could you possibly talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams found is that marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E

500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I <b>think</b> <b>very</b> likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
