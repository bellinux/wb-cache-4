5|$|Although {{it is now}} {{possible}} to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered {{a greater proportion of}} the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful.

As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E

After the French had fully committed {{the best of the}} Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.|$|E

At the time the Australians believed there were around 390 Japanese defending the area surrounding the Genga River—considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> Japanese defence line in the northern sector—but it was later determined {{to be closer to}} 900 men from the 81st Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Shinzo Nakamura.|$|E

This pilgrimage site was identified as a 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; it was even thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E

To make up for the loss of the Airborne Division, General Trưởng ordered the 369th Marines Brigade to replace the 3rd Airborne Brigade in Quảng Nam Province, and the 258th Marines Brigade to take over from the 2nd Airborne Brigade on Mount Phu Gia, located north of Hai Van.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles.

High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E

5|$|Development of Dark Forces {{was led by}} Daron Stinnett. The {{programming}} was led by Ray Gresko, and {{the graphics}} and storyline by Justin Chin. Production began in September 1993, {{at a time when}} the first-person shooter genre was very popular. The idea of creating a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe was inspired by fan mods of Doom which had levels set on the Death Star. The developers of Dark Forces wanted to adapt the FPS format into an adventure game. To do this they introduced puzzles and strategy, along with a Star Wars plot. Originally Luke Skywalker was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> character in the game, however the developers realized that this would add constraints to gameplay and storyline. Instead a new character, Kyle Katarn, was created.|$|E
