5|$|Refusing to give up, SpongeBob and Patrick peacefully {{petition}} {{to stop the}} highway. Nobody listens to them, however, and they are quickly exiled for their actions. Soon afterwards, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> parade meant to commemorate the groundbreaking of the highway. The highway is rapidly built and, as SpongeBob predicted, it turns Jellyfish Fields into a wasteland.|$|E
5|$|As Diane {{has missed}} her flight, she {{suggests}} to Ric that they visit his father's grave. At the graveside, Ric tells Diane about his troubled {{relationship with his}} father, and confesses that he has feelings for her. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> woman nearby who Diane recognises, having seen Paulina giving her money the day before. Ric confronts her, and discovers she is Esi Griffin (Gloria Acheampong), his father's last wife and widow. She has a son who is not in school, but will not explain her circumstances and tells Ric to speak to Kumi.|$|E
5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short {{airports}} to 1200 m by year 2030, because <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> lack of aircraft types which {{have more than}} 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and a {{group of}} police search for Lewton's remains. Scully sees blood {{dripping}} on Mulder's face from above and, upon looking up, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> portion of Lewton's intestine hanging from a tree. Scully, about to perform an autopsy on the intestine, is interrupted when Mona suddenly calls and reports that Bilac was under the influence of Yaje. At the museum, Mona hears noises from a restroom and, upon opening a toilet lid, she sees rats forcing {{their way out of the}} sewer. When the two agents arrive, they discover Bilac crying beside one of the toilets, saying that Mona is dead.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> play, which happens to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E

Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake.

Providing students {{with a choice of}} activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E
25|$|The plains zebra is {{a highly}} social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also {{bachelor}} groups. Groups may come together to form herds.

The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} whether {{experienced and}} new Internet users react differently to online discounts and gifts. The results obtained in a multi-group SEM analysis show that experienced users are more influenced by online sales promotions {{and have a}} greater purchase intention than new users.
