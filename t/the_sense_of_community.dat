5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> {{that arose}} from working and living {{together}} contributed {{directly to the}} energy and growth of the first union of women workers, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. Started by twelve operatives in January 1845, its membership grew to 500 within six months, and continued to expand rapidly. The Association was run completely by the women themselves: they elected their own officers and held their own meetings; they helped organize the city’s female workers, and set up branches in other mill towns. They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. Unlike many middle-class women activists, the operatives found considerable support from working-class men who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals.|$|E
5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E

With this in mind, Shaftesbury and, much less known at the time, Giambattista Vico, both presented new arguments {{for the importance of}} the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after Hans-Georg Gadamer, as a humanist interpretation of the term. Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals (methodological individualism), ignoring <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering common good sense as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.|$|E

A amostra utilizada foi constituída por 104 participantes adultos residentes na Alta de Lisboa e anteriormente residentes nos bairros abrangidos pelo Plano Especial de Realojamento. A percepção de sentido de comunidade foi medida através da Escala Breve de Sentido de Comunidade (EBCS; Brief <b>Sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>Community</b> Scale de Peterson, Speer & McMillan, 2008; versão adaptada por Marante, no prelo) e o apoio social percebido foi avaliado pela Escala de Provisões Sociais (SSP; Scale of Social Provisions de Cutrona & Russel, 1987; versão adaptada por Moreira & Canaipa, 2007). Avaliaram-se as variáveis antes do realojamento, retrospectivamente, através de uma adaptação das escalas, bem como {{posterior}} ao realojamento, relativamente à actualidade. Os resultados indicam que a Percepção de Sentido de Comunidade e Apoio Social Percebido diferem significativamente antes e depois do realojamento, sendo mais elevados na primeira situação. A análise dos resultados permitiu, também, verificar que existe uma relação positiva e significativa entre as duas variáveis em estudo, bem como correlações entre o Apoio Social Percebido e as variáveis Idade, Escolaridade, Número de Filhos e Participação em Actividades do Bairro.
