5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds with brown backs and white underparts. They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which they use <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which {{they use to}} support themselves on vertical trees. One species has been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

60|$|April 14. Laboured at proofs and {{got them}} sent off, per Mr. Freeling's cover. So there's {{an end of}} the Chronicles.[165] James rejoices in the conclusion, where there is battle and {{homicide}} of all kinds. Always politic to keep a trot for the avenue, like the Irish postilions. J.B. always calls to the boys to flog before the carriage {{gets out of the}} inn-yard. How we have driven the stage I know not and care not--except with a view <b>to</b> <b>extricating</b> my difficulties. I have lost no time in beginning the second series of Grandfather's Tales, being determined to write as much as I can even here, and deserve by industry the soft pillow I sleep on for the moment.|$|R
50|$|Wütherich died in July 1981, in Kupferzell, Germany, when {{he became}} intoxicated, lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into a residence. Like James Dean, Rolf Wütherich had <b>to</b> be <b>extricated</b> from the wreck and he died at the {{accident}} scene. He was 53 years old.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{labyrinth}} {{can serve as}} a metaphor for situations that are difficult <b>to</b> be <b>extricated</b> from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. Octavio Paz titled his book on Mexican identity The Labyrinth of Solitude, describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.|$|R
5|$|Among the {{participants}} {{of the battle}} were Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Ehud Barak, then lieutenant colonels. Tantawi commanded an infantry battalion under the 16th Infantry Brigade. He engaged Reshef's armor during October 16 and later Mordechai's paratroopers during the night of October 16/17, and was decorated for valor during the battle. Barak commanded an armored battalion during the battle and personally led the armored effort <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> the Israeli paratroopers. Both men would later serve as Ministers of Defense in their respective nations and encounter each other again in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the morning, an {{infantry}} battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, took up defensive positions in the town; the troops at Point 213 had been cut off and a force was assembled <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> them. The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered. More German troops had arrived, and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.|$|E
6000|$|The pilot attended, with a practised ear, to this {{description}} of the qualities of the ship {{that he was about}} <b>to</b> attempt <b>extricating</b> from an extremely dangerous situation.

50|$|Thompson {{worked as}} a tanner at the Woolston Tanneries in Christchurch, where he was {{involved}} in a serious accident in July 1943.

On account of the loud report of this act of valour, the Yavana (Greek) King Dimita retreated <b>to</b> Mathurahaving <b>extricated</b> his demoralized army." [...] Hathigumpha inscription, line 8, probably in the 1st century BCE. Original text is in Brahmi script.|$|R
5|$|As the British force {{took control}} of Santa Brigida, a Spanish {{squadron}} of four ships sailed from Vigo {{with the appearance of}} intending to bring Pierrepont's squadron to battle. Pierrepont immediately issued orders for his ships to meet with the Spanish who promptly turned about and returned to port without coming within range. A shore breeze enabled the British ships and their prize <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> themselves from the Commarurto rocks without further damage. They then sailed directly for the fleet base at Plymouth, arriving on 22 October to find that Thetis and Ethalion had reached the port the day before. Dispatches were sent to Lord Bridport, commander of the Channel Fleet, which were then forwarded to the Admiralty and revealed the scale of the prize.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for first responders when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E
40|$|The active {{attraction}} of foreign capital {{is a most}} important condition <b>to</b> <b>extricating</b> the nation from a protracted economic crisis. But while fulfilling this condition, it is extremely important not to repeat today the errors of others. The experience of many Asian and Latin American countries {{as well as of}} a number of East European states warns us against becoming overly enthusiastic about foreign credits. Naturally, the latter are also necessary, but primarily for tactical purposes that are in particular connected with securing balance in the internal market as an important prerequisite to deeper qualitative and structural reforms. The resolution of the strategic problems of the economic reform and the transition to the rails of a market economy presuppose first of all the securing of favorable conditions for importing capital in its productive form, the development of foreign and joint enterprise, and the creation of special economic zones in the USSR. ...|$|R
50|$|When the Japanese {{offensive}} began, Indian 17th Infantry Division {{was cut off}} in its {{forward position}} at Tiddim. One brigade of 23rd division was left to hold Imphal while {{the remainder of the}} division was sent <b>to</b> help <b>extricate</b> the 17th Division. Once the two divisions had linked up, they retreated to Bishenpur south of Imphal, being supplied by parachute drops.|$|R
50|$|On 28 May 2015, INC MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee of Katwa {{announced}} {{he joined the}} AITMC. It is believed he left the INC because he was tied {{to the murder of}} Intrajit Singh, an AITMC supporter, who was killed {{on the day of the}} local 2015 Katwa election, and wanted <b>to</b> be <b>extricated</b> out of the incident. Chatterjee and seven others were named in Singh's murder.|$|R
5|$|Kruger {{left the}} Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept {{as the train}} crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first {{outgoing}} steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, {{at the behest of}} the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS Gelderland, and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. Gelderland departed on 20 October 1900.|$|E
5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by the Spartans {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging the Spartans, Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' hope was that his son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was set upon by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged the Spartans with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus' {{advance on}} Argos {{did not go}} {{smoothly}} as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped {{that the presence of}} his son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing. Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry.|$|E
50|$|The two Pandas {{competing}} in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room {{has been found}} inside for accessories like aluminium platforms <b>to</b> help <b>extricate</b> the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.|$|R
5000|$|Tuesday Productions {{wanted to}} focus their efforts on Armatrading and decided {{they were going to}} market her as a solo artist, despite the {{collaboration}} with Nestor. From the many songs submitted for the album, only those featuring Armatrading singing were chosen. Nestor later commented: [...] "I got edged out that way." [...] The album was released as a [...] "Joan Armatrading" [...] record, and the front cover credited it to her alone. This caused tensions between the two writers, and this, together with the later promotional gigs organised by Sherry Copeland and Tuesday Productions/Cube that excluded Nestor entirely, contributed to the eventual break-up of the duo. These decisions were also responsible for causing a rift between Armatrading and Tuesday Productions/Cube Records, with Armatrading later devoting some time <b>to</b> <b>extricating</b> herself from the contract with them. Some years later Armatrading sued Mike Stone, who subsequently returned to America, and although she did not use Gus Dudgeon as a producer again, she later dedicated her 2003 album Lovers Speak to him and his wife Sheila.|$|R
25|$|Summit {{railway station}} {{was at the}} summit of the Wairarapa Line over the Rimutaka Ranges in the Wellington region of New Zealand’s North Island and was where trains were marshalled for a descent down the Rimutaka Incline or for Fell {{locomotives}} <b>to</b> be <b>extricated</b> from a train that had ascended the Incline. The station was between Kaitoke and Cross Creek stations on the Wairarapa Line. The station was bypassed when the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 460s BC, the Athenians {{took the}} ambitious {{decision}} to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. Although the Greek task force achieved initial successes, they were unable to capture the Persian garrison in Memphis, despite a 3-year long siege. The Persians then counterattacked, and the Athenian force was itself besieged for 18 months, before being wiped out. This disaster, coupled with ongoing warfare in Greece, dissuaded the Athenians from resuming conflict with Persia. In 451 BC however, a truce was agreed in Greece, and Cimon was then able to lead an expedition to Cyprus. However, while besieging Kition, Cimon died, and the Athenian force decided to withdraw, winning another double victory at the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus in order <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> themselves. This campaign marked the end of hostilities between the Delian League and Persia, and therefore {{the end of the}} Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 2/14th was {{committed}} to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, {{in the vanguard of}} the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was there that the battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he moved beyond the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area. A platoon was sent in <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> Honner as the Japanese began advancing on his position, and after directing a company-level attack against the Japanese, Honner handed over command to Captain Ian Hamilton, commander of 'C' Company, who served as acting commander briefly until Major Mert Lee arrived from brigade headquarters. Lee remained in acting command until the battalion second-in-command, Major Philip Rhoden, returned from a staff course to officially take over command of the battalion as a lieutenant colonel in December.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>extricate</b> the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach {{on the underside of}} a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
50|$|Montgomery also {{remained}} {{committed to}} the well-being of Miklós Horthy, who was captured by American troops at the war's end: as the Allies prepared for the Nuremberg Trials, Montgomery used his influence in Washington <b>to</b> help <b>extricate</b> Horthy from indictment and trial. Horthy was interviewed extensively, and later was called to testify at the trial of a Nazi administrator in Budapest, but was never charged for any of his actions during or before the war.|$|R

60|$|My Dear and Meriem bowed their {{acknowledgments}} of the introduction. The {{man seemed}} rather {{ill at ease}} in their presence. His host attributed this {{to the fact that}} his guest was unaccustomed to the society of cultured women, and so found a pretext <b>to</b> quickly <b>extricate</b> him from his seemingly unpleasant position and lead him away to his study and the brandy and soda which were evidently much less embarrassing to Mr. Hanson.|$|R
