5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>and</b> {{trying to keep it}} in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his rule, the government was divided between two PDPA factions: the Khalqists (which Taraki was the leader of), <b>the</b> <b>majority,</b> <b>and</b> the Parchamites, the minority. In 1978, shortly after his rule began, Taraki started a purge of the government and party which led to several high-ranking Parchamite members being sent into de facto exile by being assigned to serve overseas as ambassadors. His reign was marked by a cult of personality centered on himself that had been cultivated by Amin. His relationship with Amin turned sour during his rule, ultimately resulting in Taraki's overthrow on 14 September 1979 and subsequent murder on 8 or 9 October, upon Amin's orders.|$|E

5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>and</b> gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E
5|$|Peart {{got a job}} in Lakeside Park, in Port Dalhousie on {{the shores}} of Lake Ontario, which later {{inspired}} a song of the same name on the Rush album Caress of Steel. He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency to take it easy when business was slack resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, <b>the</b> <b>Majority,</b> <b>and</b> JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E

25|$|The {{case was}} a virtual replay of Sorrells v. United States, the 1932 {{case in which the}} justices had first {{recognized}} entrapment as a defense.

25|$|Despite these varying viewpoints, the Swedish-speaking {{population}} in Finland in general {{have their own}} identity distinct from that of <b>the</b> <b>majority,</b> <b>and</b> they wish {{to be recognized as}} such. In speaking Swedish, Swedish-speaking Finns predominantly use the Swedish word finländare (approximately translatable as Finlanders) when referring to all Finnish nationals. The purpose is to use a term that includes both themselves and Finnish-speaking Finns because the Swedish word finnar, in Finland-Swedish usage, implies a Finnish-speaking Finn. In Sweden, this distinction between finländare and finnar is not widely understood and often not made.|$|E

Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> Senate, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> whip is <b>the</b> third-highest ranking {{individual}} in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> party (<b>the</b> party {{with the most}} seats). <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> whip is outranked by <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> leader <b>and,</b> unofficially, <b>the</b> president pro tempore; because the office of president pro tempore is largely honorific and usually given to the longest-serving senator of <b>the</b> <b>majority,</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> conference in terms of actual power. Similarly, in <b>the</b> House, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> whip is outranked by both <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> leader <b>and</b> <b>the</b> speaker.
