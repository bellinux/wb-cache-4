The agreement would allow for buses and light rail trains to share <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A separate agreement signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and officially taken into use on 1 June. The tunnel, {{including}} Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170 million. At first, <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Nationaltheatret {{was used by}} commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> turned at Skøyen. On 27 May 1989, OsloV was closed and all traffic started running via Nationaltheatret.|$|E

5|$|Laying of tracks, signaling, {{power supply}} and other {{infrastructure}} {{was done by}} Baneservice. The cost for the entire section from Asker to Sandvika was NOK70 million.

5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach its destination {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> ultimately escape.

5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> <b>and</b> fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E
5|$|Completion of the -long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 {{significantly}} reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona. The famous Tunnel View {{is on the}} valley side of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Old Inspiration Point is above it. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway {{out of business in}} 1945. The present day Tioga Road, now part of California State Route 120, was dedicated in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the many thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> <b>and</b> fears that the tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its own services and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London.|$|E

5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout {{and loss of}} ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, some {{residents}} of Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood informed rebel leaders {{that they could}} use a sewer tunnel that ran from the Dung Gate to a mill in the Jewish Quarter, to clandestinely enter Jerusalem. The next day, 36 rebels (peasants and Jerusalemites) {{under the leadership of}} Sheikh Subh Shawkah, chief of the Bethlehem-area Fawaghirah tribe, entered the city via <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> then opened the Dung Gate to allow thousands of rebels inside the walled city.

50|$|Yarra Bank Highway {{is a short}} 2 km {{highway in}} central Melbourne, Australia.

5|$|The Ridge Route was {{official}}ly the Castaic-Tejon Route. The official {{limits of the}} Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction and {{the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine. Until 1930–31 the road from San Fernando to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at San Fernando Pass and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the Santa Clara River. A 1930 bypass of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> Newhall through Weldon Canyon is now part of The Old Road.|$|E

Buses enter the tunnel under 9th Avenue, passing under the historic Camlin Hotel, before joining the University Link Tunnel used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under Pine Street to Capitol Hill station.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{was officially}} opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications, Ronald Bye, and officially taken into use on 1 June.

The tunnel cost 625million Norwegian krone(NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170million. At first, the tunnel was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>and</b> turned at Skøyen.
