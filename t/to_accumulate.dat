5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern. In order <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> mass, however, {{only a portion of}} the accreted gas can be ejected, so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B could continue <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> a growing envelope.|$|E

His highest one day score, a match-winning 146, came in the 1965 Gillette Cup final against Surrey.

40|$|High {{capacity}} optical networks need modulation formats, {{which have}} high spectral efficiency, tolerant to dispersion and good resilience to fiber nonlinearities. We have investigated through simulation the conventional optical non return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), single-side-band return-to-zero (SSB-RZ) and carrier-suppressed return-to-zero (CS-RZ) modulation formats, {{with reference to}} their spectral efficiency, tolerance <b>to</b> <b>accumulated</b> dispersion and their resiliency <b>to</b> <b>accumulated</b> nonlinearities. In addition their alternative duobinary formats were also investigated. The {{results showed that the}} alternative duobinary modulation schemes occupied the smallest amount of bandwidth and were most tolerant <b>to</b> <b>accumulated</b> dispersion, while the conventional modulation schemes had better resilience <b>to</b> <b>accumulated</b> fiber nonlinearities...|$|R

5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, it tends <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> {{at the bottom}} of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{studies have}} shown that organic {{material}} began <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> on the Blackdown Hills in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods with areas of open meadow, grass land with small woodland components being identified.

5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world sandbox {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> enough mass to become a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, {{and is able to}} stay at the form of the object of their preference. Six different object are available in the game: small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star and black hole.|$|E
5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports 3,4-diaminopyridine] {{at least for}} a few weeks. The 3,4-diaminopyridine base or the water-soluble 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate may be used. Both 3,4-diaminopyridine formulations delay the repolarization of nerve terminals after a discharge, thereby allowing more calcium <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> in the nerve terminal.|$|E
5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank <b>to</b> <b>accumulate.</b>|$|E

5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment then began <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> {{at the base}} of the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E

5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, {{and because he was}} a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed <b>to</b> <b>accumulate,</b> and never managed to clear them.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%. Follow-on experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA were expected <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> {{a mass of}} 30g in six days {{and to have a}} relative uncertainty of better than 1ppm. Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> on seamounts, {{which are}} typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{coached by}} Bill Mallory, {{who would go}} on <b>to</b> <b>accumulate</b> the winningest record in IU {{football}} history.

From the start, however, Indiana set out to upset those expectations. Indiana raced out to a 30 record in the first three games of the season, with the third win coming against Southeastern Conference opponent Kentucky.|$|E
