40|$|Manufacturers are {{increasingly}} being required to adhere to product take-back regulations that require them to manage their products {{at the end of}} life. Such regulations seek to internalize products' entire life cycle costs into market prices, with the ultimate objective of reducing their environmental burden. This article provides a framework to evaluate the potential for take-back regulations to actually lead to reduced environmental impacts and to stimulate product design changes. It describes trade-offs associated with several major policy decisions, including whether to hold firms physically or financially responsible for the recovery of their products, when to impose recycling fees, whether to include disposal and hazardous substance bans, and whether to mandate product design features to foster reuse and recycling of components and materials. The framework also addresses policy elements that can significantly affect the cost efficiency and occupational safety hazards of end-of-life product recovery operations.

This thesis project investigates typical and conformational tendencies of a hypothetical end-of-life electronics recycling system based in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Optimal <b>waste</b> processor configurations, along with cost drivers and sensitivities are identified using a simple reverse logistics linear programming model. The experimental procedure entails varying the model scenario based on: type of material being recycled, the properties of current recycling and consolidation practices, and an extrapolation of current trends into the future. The transition from a decentralized to a centralized recycling network is shown to be dependent on the balance between transportation costs and facility costs, with the latter being a much more important cost consideration than the former. Additionally, this project sets the stage for a great deal of future work to ensure the profitability of domestic e-waste recycling systems. by Jonathan Seth Krones. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{creation}} and disposal of food <b>waste</b> in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Food <b>waste</b> is a specific yet highly critical issue that implicates the large, incongruous systems of both food production and waste disposal. Waste is created throughout the food supply chain, with producers as well as consumers guilty of throwing away good food. Rather than repurpose food as compost or donate it to those in need, wasted food, although completely biodegradable and often edible, is {{mixed in with the}} rest of our garbage and disposed of in a landfill. By evaluating the systems of waste disposal and food production, I illustrate the ways in which both of these industries encourage the creation of food waste and conceal its harmful effects. I argue {{that it is necessary to}} prioritize source reduction of wasted food, rather than rely upon infrastructure that keeps waste “out of sight, out of mind. ” Despite the factors that shelter it from our critical consideration, it has become necessary to prioritize food waste as a legitimate environmental, social, and economic concern...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a data {{collection}} containing values for the dielectric properties of various low-level liquid waste (LLLW) simulants measured as a function of frequency, temperature, and composition. The investigation was motivated by current interest in the use of microwave processing for the treatment of radioactive waste. A large volume of transuranic liquid and sludge produced by the U. S. Department of Defense (DOD) during the production of nuclear fiel bars is stored at several U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites around <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>Waste</b> storage and disposal space is scarce, expensive, and must be minimized. Thus, several DOE sites are pursuing the use of microwave heating as a means of achieving volume reduction and solidification of low-level liquid wastes. It is important to know which microwave frequencies should be employed tc achieve the most efficient processing at a range of different temperatures. The dielectric properties of the LLLW simulants can be utilized to determine the optimum frequencies for use with a particular LLLW or with other LLLWS of similar composition. Furthermore, nonlinear thermal processes, such as thermal runaway, which occur in the material being treated cannot be modeled without a knowledge of the temperature dependence of the dielectric properties. Often, this data does not exist; however, when it does, only very limited data near room temperature are available. The data collection generated in this study can be used to predict the behavior of a variety of microwave thermal treatment technologies, which have the potential of substantially reducing the volume of the LLLWS that are currently stored at many DOE sites. This information should help the users of the microwave reduction and solidification technology to optimize microwave processes used in the treatment of LLLW. The microwave reduction and solidification technology has clear advantages over other methods of reducing LLLWS. These include the incineration of combustibles, the evaporation of combustibles, the evaporation of liquids, and the compaction of noncombustibles. The handling of radioactive liquid waste is generally carried out within closed systems consisting of highly corrosion-resistant, welded, leak-tight pipes, tanks, and other apparatus. High power microwave processing is a promising technology for reducing risks to the environment and human health, thereby supporting the DOE's decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) objectives...|$|R
