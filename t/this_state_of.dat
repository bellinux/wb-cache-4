5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. <b>This</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change.

Continued dissatisfaction with <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfaction with <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs {{continued}} to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into {{a crisis in}} October 97, {{when members of the}} Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but abdicated.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington {{had recently been}} defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{tells of}} his desire to return to Amfortas (""). He relates his long journey, how he wandered for years, {{unable to find a}} path back to the Grail. He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded the Spear in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands and Belgium {{wished to}} remain neutral {{and refused to}} allow the RAF to {{establish}} bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line, but their air force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a pre-emptive strike against the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach. <b>This</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|The US {{plan had}} been delayed by the wartime {{need to build}} smaller vessels. Nevertheless, {{estimates}} by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships. By the beginning of 1920, the Americans had completed one battleship {{since the end of}} World War I and had five more building. Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920–21, six of these were the very large and powerful , armed with twelve 16-inch guns. The Japanese had finished one battleship {{since the end of the}} war and had three more under construction. To correct <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in Fiscal Year (FY) 1921–22 and again in FY 1922–23, but this was changed to four s to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year.|$|E

5|$|The interdiction effort during Commando Hunt VI (15 May through 31 October 1971) {{was thrown}} off by Lam Son 719 during April and May. During the offensive, 80 {{percent of all}} U.S. aerial sorties were {{directed}} to support it. This highlighted what was now rapidly becoming a dual dilemma for the Air Force: First, the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia meant that there were fewer and fewer air assets available with which to conduct more and more missions. During Commando Hunt, for example, 1,777 aircraft were utilized during the campaign. By {{the time of the}} opening of Commando Hunt VI, that figure had decreased to 1,199 aircraft and this number dropped to 953 before that phase was completed; Second, <b>this</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs was exacerbated by the withdrawal of sorties to conduct missions for Operation Freedom Deal in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs persisted {{for several}} decades, until Michael K. Brett-Surman reexamined the {{pertinent}} material for his graduate {{studies in the}} 1970s and 1980s. He concluded that the type species of Anatosaurus, A. annectens, was actually a species of Edmontosaurus and that A. copei was different enough to warrant its own genus. Although theses and dissertations are not regarded as official publications by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, which regulates the naming of organisms, his conclusions were known to other paleontologists, and were adopted by several popular works of the time. Brett-Surman and Ralph Chapman designated a new genus for A. copei (Anatotitan) in 1990. Of the remaining species, A. saskatchewanensis and A. edmontoni were assigned to Edmontosaurus as well, and A. longiceps went to Anatotitan, as either a second species or as a synonym of A. copei. Because the type species of Anatosaurus (A. annectens) was sunk into Edmontosaurus, the name Anatosaurus is abandoned as a junior synonym of Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. <b>This</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E

5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. <b>This</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E
