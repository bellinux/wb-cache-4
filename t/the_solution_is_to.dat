25|$|A {{faction of}} Spacers {{have come to}} the {{realization}} that Spacer culture is stagnating due to negative population growth and longevity, and feels that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> encourage further space exploration and colonization by Earthmen in concert with robots. However, Earthmen would first need to overcome their antagonism of robots. To this end, they have established habitations on Earth through which they hope to introduce humanoid robots to Earth.|$|E
25|$|If {{event or}} event chain occurs {{during the course}} of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> assign the mitigation plan to an event or event chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different events.|$|E
500|$|The {{goal is to}} {{determine}} x from its N remainders x'i. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus M that {{is the product of}} all the individual moduli m'i, and define M'i as ...|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{the demand}} between Masterton and Wellington was {{exceeding}} {{the capacity of}} the 88-seater railcars, with a capacity of 176 with two railcars. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> introduce a diesel-hauled carriage service.|$|R
500|$|Despite his success, Homer {{notices that}} his team members are {{starting}} to get overworked. He decides that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get them hammocks and visits Scorpio to ask where he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of [...] "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the 59th Street Bridge. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking outside the window.|$|E
500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush had said in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E

50|$|Forced to emigrate, Rutenberg {{settled in}} Italy. Away from politics, he {{concentrated}} on hydraulic engineering. Pondering on specific Jewish problems, he became convinced that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> establish <b>the</b> national home for the Jewish people.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s {{there was}} a growing lack of {{teaching}} sisters. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> hire much more expensive lay teachers, who grew from 4% of the elementary teachers in the Chicago archdiocese in 1950 to 38% by 1965.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 2011, JEFX events became smaller, {{in light}} of budget shortfalls. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> focus on {{specific}} areas for improvement in C2 integration and conducted {{on a smaller scale}} on a quarterly basis with occasional large scale events.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the early}} units, {{particularly}} the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical [...] "ticking" [...] noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem {{appears to have}} come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.|$|E
2500|$|Let S be a set and let FS be {{the free}} group on S. [...] Let R be {{a set of}} words on S, so R {{naturally}} gives a subset of FS. To form a group with presentation , {{the idea is to}} take FS quotient by the smallest normal subgroup such that each element of R gets identified with the identity. Note that R might not be a subgroup, let alone a normal subgroup of FS, so we cannot take a quotient by R. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take the normal closure N of R in FS. The group [...] is then defined as the quotient group ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Copper Poisoning," [...] a 2010 news article, linked copper {{poisoning}} to plastic tanks. The article {{indicated that}} rainwater was collected {{and stored in}} plastic tanks and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH. The water was then brought into homes by copper piping. The copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans. It {{is important to note}} that, while the plastic tank is an inert container, the collected acid rain could and should be analysed and pH adjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> monitor stored rainwater with swimming pool strips, cheap and available at swimming pool supply outlets.|$|E
50|$|As {{the schools}} searched {{for ways to}} stay {{together}} and hold onto long-time rivalries, it <b>was</b> evident <b>to</b> all parties that the enrollment disparity between the nine schools would <b>be</b> problematic. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> expand and split divisions, ending {{the tradition of the}} Little 7 Conference.|$|R
2500|$|The book {{depicted}} a state engulfed by political corruption, drained by governmental extravagance, {{and under the}} control of [...] "a mass of black barbarism."

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{burn out}} each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then {{prepared}} to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, {{consisting of a}} head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|E
2500|$|Setting {{up sound}} {{reinforcement}} for live music clubs and dance events often poses unique challenges, {{because there is}} such a large variety of venues which are used as clubs, ranging from former warehouses or music theaters to small restaurants or basement pubs with concrete walls. Dance events may be held in huge warehouses, aircraft hangars or outdoor spaces. In some cases, clubs are housed in multi-story venues with balconies or in [...] "L"-shaped rooms, which makes it hard to get a consistent sound for all audience members. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use fill-in speakers to obtain good coverage, using a delay to ensure that the audience does not hear the same sound at different times.|$|E
2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008). As Cecil Adams puts it (Adams 1990), [...] "Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or you can have the other two doors." [...] The [...] chance of finding the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty, knowing the location of the car, is certain to reveal a goat. So the player's choice after the host opens a door is no different than if the host offered the player the option to switch from the original chosen door to the set of both remaining doors. The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prospect}} of gaining {{new insights into}} Elgar's character and composition methods, and perhaps revealing new music, continues to motivate {{the search for a}} definitive solution. But Norman Del Mar expressed the view that [...] "there would be considerable loss if <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, much of the work's attraction lying in the impenetrability of the riddle itself", and that interest in the work would not be as strong had the Enigma been solved during Elgar's lifetime.|$|R

5000|$|To {{deal with}} the {{increasingly}} sharp conflicts between different interest groups, the Communist Party of China {{was said to have}} split ideologically over the [...] "cake issue". On one side, orthodox communists suggest that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> focus on distributing the wealth while pursuing higher growth ("dividing the cake"), while reformers and liberals suggest that <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pursue continued growth and worry about dividing the wealth once the material wealth threshold is reached ("baking a bigger cake").|$|E
2500|$|In {{justifying}} these actions, Macaulay {{argued that}} Sanskrit and Arabic were wholly inadequate for students studying history, science, and technology. He stated, [...] "We have {{to educate people}} who cannot at present be educated by means of their mother-tongue. We must teach them some foreign language." [...] <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> teach English.|$|R
50|$|A major design {{challenge}} was {{the noise of}} the public transit tracks passing over <b>the</b> lot. <b>The</b> <b>solution</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enclose a 530 ft section of the tracks in a stainless steel tube passing over the building. The tube's support structure is completely independent of the building's, to minimize vibration passing between them.|$|R

50|$|Children in Ancient Greece were {{familiar}} with traditional myths from an early age. Based on the writings of philosopher Plato (c. 428-347 BC), mothers and nursemaids narrated myths and stories to the children in their charge. These women were tasked with rearing children.
