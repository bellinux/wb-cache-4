40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to develop and apply alloy theory methods to {{transition}} metals and alloys (particularly ternary systems) based on the tight-binding (TB) model of atomic cohesion in studies of stability and phase equilibria. At least two factors make this kind of formalism desirable: it can bring {{a clear understanding of}} the underlying physical mechanisms that many times get obscured in first-principles calculations, and it is easily adapted to complex problems and multicomponent solu-Itions, at low computational cost. The original physical insight given by the TB method is demonstrated by the study of the relation between the atomic local environment and the relative stability of simple phases, through the calculation of the moments of the electronic density of states. We show that the relative stability of phases related to the Bain transformation is mainly controlled by the moment of order five, and we have identified the main contributions to this moment.

40|$|Abstract — In this work, we {{show the}} {{mathematical}} reasons why parametric models {{fall short of}} providing correct estimates and define an approach that overcomes the causes of these shortfalls. The approach aims at improving parametric estimation models when any regression model assumption is violated for the data being analyzed. Violations can be that, the errors are x-correlated, the model is not linear, the sam-ple is heteroscedastic, or the error probability distribution is not Gaussian. If data violates the regression assumptions {{and we do not}} deal with the consequences of these violations, we cannot improve the model and estimates will be incorrect forever. The novelty of this work is that we define and use a feed-forward multi-layer neural network for discrimination problems to calculate prediction intervals (i. e. evaluate uncer-tainty), make estimates, and detect improvement needs. The primary difference from traditional methodologies is that the proposed approach can deal with scope error, model error, and assumption error at the same time. The approach can be applied for prediction, inference, and model improvement over any situation and context without making specific assumptions. An important benefit of the approach is <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to model {{cortical}} networks and emulate higher-level brain function, especially in the recognition, classification, and learning of spatio-temporal signals of the kind occurring in natural and artificial settings, we have been investigating the dynamics of {{a new class of}} networks composed of parametrically coupled bifurcation processing elements. The spatio-temporal signals of particular interest to us are of the variety produced by sensor arrays in radar, sonar and ATR as result of relative motion between the sensor platform and the scattering object. The bifurcation processing elements in these networks are logistic maps representing netlets or neuronal assemblies of the cortex. In the preceding quarterly report evidence was presented in support of the hypothesis that the basic functional unit in the cortex, the seat of higher-level brain function, maybe mathematically modeled by a bifurcation processing element: a parametrically driven noninvertible map on the unit interval such as the logistic map or the sine-circle map.

40|$|Representations in {{the cortex}} are often {{distributed}} with graded firing {{rates in the}} neuronal populations. The firing rate probability distribution of each neuron {{to a set of}} stimuli is often exponential or gamma. In processes in the brain, such as decision-making, that are influenced by the noise produced by the close to random spike timings of each neuron for a given mean rate, the noise with this graded type of representation may be larger than with the binary firing rate distribution that is usually investigated. In integrate-and-fire simulations of an attractor decision-making network, we show that the noise is indeed greater for a given sparseness of the representation for graded, exponential, than for binary firing rate distributions. The greater noise was measured by faster escaping times from the spontaneous firing rate state when the decision cues are applied, and this corresponds to faster decision or reaction times. The greater noise was also evident as less stability of the spontaneous firing state before the decision cues are applied. The implication is that spiking-related noise {{will continue to be a}} factor that influences processes such as decision-making, signal detection, short-term memory, and memory recall even with the quite large networks found in the cerebral cortex.

The following example illustrates another aspect of this argument: the New York wholesale price of ice-packed broilers was 32. 9 cents per pound in 1930 and 23. 1 cents in 1957. 1 The prices in the intervening years show the effect of inflation pulling in one direc-tion and improved technology pulling in the other.

Here, we observe that Ca 2 + permeates this VIC channel when assayed in artificial, planar lipid bilayers, and, using an energy barrier model to describe cation fluxes, predict <b>that</b> <b>it</b> catalyzes <b>Ca</b> 2 + influx under physiological ionic conditions.

The tertiary structure of secretagogin changes significantly upon Ca 2 +} binding, but not upon Mg 2 +}-binding, and the amount of exposed hydrophobic surface in secretagogin increases upon Ca 2 +}-binding, but not upon Mg 2 +}-binding.

Only one secretagogin-interacting protein was reproducibly identified from insulinoma cell lysates and from bovine and mouse brain homogenates. This protein was identified as SNAP- 25, a protein involved in Ca 2 +}-induced exocytosis in neurons and in neuroendocrine cells.

40|$|The initial {{events in}} signal {{transduction}} in insulin-secreting cells {{are summarized in}} FIGURE 8. Both nutrient stimuli, such as glucose and amino acids and the muscarinic agonist carbachol (carbamylcholine) raise [Ca 2 +]i. Although the rise in [Ca 2 +]i precedes the stimulation of insulin release, {{it is not a}} moment-to-moment regulator of release. The metabolizable fuel stimuli cause Ca 2 + influx through voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels following depolarization of the membrane potential. In contrast, carbachol, which does not depolarize, elicits Ptd Ins 4, 5 -P 2 hydrolysis, a reaction catalyzed by phospholipase C. The generation of Ins 1, 4, 5 -P 3 in this instance is Ca 2 + independent, but appears to involve a GTP-binding protein. However, this protein is not a substrate for pertussis toxin. The levels of Ins 1, 4, 5 -P 3, which releases Ca 2 + from an ATP-dependent Ca 2 + pool of the endoplasmic reticulum, are increased prior to the rise in [Ca 2 +]i. The mitochondria may take up Ca 2 + after large increases in [Ca 2 +]i. A previously proposed second messenger, arachidonic acid, is much less selective than Ins 1, 4, 5 -P 3 in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> releases <b>Ca</b> 2 + from mitochondria {{as well as from the}} endoplasmic reticulum in a slow and irreversible manner. As Ins 1, 4, 5 -P 3 is also generated during glucose stimulation of islets, albeit in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, this metabolite could mediate not only the action of carbachol but also contribute to amplifying the [Ca 2 +]i rise in response to glucose...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) and histamine (His) on the membrane potential and current {{were examined in}} JR- 1 cells, a mucin-producing epithelial cell line derived from human gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. The tight-seal, whole cell clamp technique was used. The resting membrane potential, the input resistance, and the capacitance of the cells were approximately- 12 mV, 1. 4 GI), and 50 pF, respectively. Under the voltage-clamp condition, no voltagedependent currents were evoked. ACh or His added to the bathing solution hyperpolarized the membrane by activating a time- and voltage-independent K + current. The ACh-induced hyperpolarization and K + current persisted, while the His response desensitized quickly (< 1 rain). These effects of ACh and His were mediated predominantly by m 3 -muscarinic and Hi-His receptors, respectively. The K + current induced by ACh and His was inhibited by charybdotoxin, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a <b>Ca</b> 2 +-activated K + channel current (IK. ca) - The measurement of intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) using Indo- 1 revealed that both agents increased [Ca 2 +]i with similar time courses as they increased IK.
