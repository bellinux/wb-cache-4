If the scholar or savant cannot answer their {{haphazard}} questions on the shortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken. But the better-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind {{as a pair of}} legs able to walk east or west according to choice. Intellect is no longer taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or mediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in one line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other directions, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which is a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another. We have convinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in theorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may seem the [...] "poor Poll" [...] of the company in conversation and yet write with some humorous vigour.

The old <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> removed from the ancient building were tested to evaluate the effectiveness of CFRP materials for flexural repair of damaged timber structural elements. In both cases the CFRP plates were embedded into small grooves at the beams tensile zone.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried on for evaluating flexural strengthening with FRP plates of <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> This paper concerns {{the first set}} of tests involving six new <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> The experimental investigation considered firstly the new <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> for evaluating the efficiency of FRP technology because the defects are reduced in them. In fact the historical <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> may be affected by insect action and ambient aggression. The CFRP was installed at beams intrados (tensile zone) into a small grove of a few millimeters. The groove was filled with epoxy resin before plate installation. The experimental investigation involved un-strengthened beams, un-damaged reinforced beams and damaged and strengthened beams. The experimental result was encouraging because of the flexural strength and ductility increment. The FRP is a suitable technology for timber structures rehabilitation for reduced increment in dead load compared with increment of strength and ductility in the structural elements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceExperimental and {{finite element}} (FE) studies of bending {{behaviour}} of finger-jointed <b>timber</b> (Spruce) <b>beams</b> reinforced with CFRP material were performed. Four-point bending tests with distinct reinforcement configurations were proposed {{in order to}} determine stiffness, ductility and strength values of strengthened finger-jointed <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> The experimental results obtained under flexure showed that the external bonding of CFRP increased the load-bearing capacity of finger-jointed Spruce <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> The numerical results presented here were based on the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) available in Abaqus code, allowing the description of the progressive failure mode of the finger-jointed <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> under flexural load. The FE models took the different material constitutive laws (wood, CFRP and adhesive) into account, including the bond-slip actions between finger-joints and CFRP-timber interface. The results in terms of load-mid span deflection and failure modes obtained experimentally and numerically were compared. Once the FE simulations were calibrated, the differences between experimental and predicted ultimate loads were around 4. 5 % only. A good agreement was therefore found, proving the relevance of the presented FE models to predict the load-bearing capacity and to capture the failure mode of CFRP-strengthened finger-jointed Spruce <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> in bending...|$|R
40|$|Design {{models for}} timber {{structures}} in fire usually {{take into account}} the loss in cross-section due to charring and the temperature-dependent reduction in strength of timber. For bonded timber elements like glued laminated <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> it is assumed that the adhesive used does not influence the resistance of structural <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> significantly. To investigate the fire resistance of bonded timber elements a comprehensive research project is currently in progress at the Institute of Structural Engineering of ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The aim of this research project is the development of a simplified design model for the fire resistance of bonded structural timber elements taking into account the behavior at elevated temperature of the adhesive used. This paper presents experimental analyses and results of first calculations performed on the influence of the adhesive on the load-carrying capacity of glued laminated timber members in fire. It is shown that the temperature-dependent material properties of the adhesive used in the bondline of glued laminated <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> have small influence on the shear resistance. For the investigated <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> failure occurs mainly due to exceeding the bending moment resistance. Because of the steep temperature gradient in <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> during fire exposure the temperature in the inner region of the cross-section is rather low; hence the shear capacity in the bondline between the different lamellas is still sufficient. However, in case of finger jointed lamellas of glued laminated <b>timber</b> <b>beams,</b> the influence of adhesive used in the finger joints is more significant and has to be considered. Tensile tests at elevated temperatures on finger jointed specimens confirmed the significant influence of the adhesive used...|$|R

40|$|Wooden bridges {{date back}} to the Roman age and had a {{remarkable}} expansion during the course of history. Therefore, reinforcing and upgrading of existing <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> is often necessary.

The second reinforcement technique consists in the insertion of Basalt Fibre Reinforced Polymer (BFRP) bars into the <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> to restore the continuity of cracked sections.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} the {{flexural}} behaviour of <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> externally reinforced using Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). A non-linear finite element analysis was proposed, and was validated with respect to experimental tests carried out on seven beams. All the beams had the same square cross-section geometry and were loaded under four-point bending, but had different numbers of CFRP layers. The Abaqus software was used, and different material models were evaluated {{with respect to their}} ability to describe the behaviour of the solid <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> Elasto-plastic behaviour with damage effect was assumed for the timber material, linear elastic isotropic model was used for the CFRP, and a cohesive model was used to represent the interaction between two adherent surfaces (CFRP and timber). These two surfaces were paired and, taking into account the presence of an adhesive layer, one of them was defined as the master surface whilst the other was the slave surface. Predicted and measured load-mid-span deflection responses and failure modes were compared. The increases of flexural strength for the two different reinforcement schemes with 2 and 3 layers of CFRP composite sheets were 41. 82 % and 60. 24 %, respectively, with respect to the unreinforced <b>timber</b> <b>beams.</b> The maximal difference between calculated and experimental ultimate load-bearing capacity for reinforced solid <b>timber</b> <b>beams</b> with 2 -layers of CFRP was around 1. 2 %...|$|R
