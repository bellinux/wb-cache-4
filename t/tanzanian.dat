5|$|By 1978, {{the number}} of Amin's {{supporters}} and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed {{as a result of}} the years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile. In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General Mustafa Adrisi, was injured in a car crash, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the <b>Tanzanian</b> border. Amin accused <b>Tanzanian</b> President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of <b>Tanzanian</b> territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E

The majority of <b>Tanzanians,</b> including the Sukuma and the Nyamwezi, are Bantu.|$|R
25|$|Informal {{polls have}} {{indicate}} that most <b>Tanzanians</b> (80 percent) have an unfavourable {{view of the}} East African Federation. Tanzania has more land {{than all the other}} EAC nations combined (at least until the accession of South Sudan), and some <b>Tanzanians</b> fear landgrabs by the current residents of the other EAC member nations.|$|R
5|$|Obote {{took refuge}} in Tanzania, having been offered {{sanctuary}} there by the <b>Tanzanian</b> President Julius Nyerere. Obote was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing Amin. The exiles attempted but failed to regain Uganda in 1972, through a poorly organised coup attempt.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, {{hundreds}} of Comoran government troops began assembling on Mohéli, which {{is closer to}} Anjouan than the larger island, Grande Comore. Sudan and Senegal provided a total of 750 troops, while Libya offered logistical support for the operation. In addition, 500 <b>Tanzanian</b> troops were due to arrive soon after. France, the former colonial power, also assisted the operation by airlifting AU troops to the area.|$|E
5000|$|Rappers such as Sam Stigillydaa has said, [...] "American rappers {{talk about}} crazy things- drinking, drugs, {{violence}} against women, American blacks kill blacks. I hope African rap stays African and doesn't turn crazy." [...] <b>Tanzanians</b> view the United States as an aggressive country that romanticizes both violence and crime whereas Tanzania dispels such a romanticization {{of violence and}} crime. <b>Tanzanians</b> view crime as caused by economic need, not greed, and those who become criminals risk having people brand them social outcasts. <b>Tanzanians</b> also view cultural imperialism {{as a form of}} symbolic violence that relies on a relationship of constrained communication to extort submission.|$|R
5000|$|... Tanzania had 56 mobile {{telephone}} subscribers per 100 inhabitants, a rate slightly above the sub-Saharan average. Very few <b>Tanzanians</b> have fixed-line telephones. Approximately 12% of <b>Tanzanians</b> used the internet , though this number is rapidly growing.

5|$|The {{original}} investigations levelled accusations at Silverio Nungo (who {{was later}} executed) and Lazaro Kavandame, FRELIMO leader in Cabo Delgado. The latter {{had made no}} secret of his distrust of Mondlane, seeing him as too conservative a leader, and the <b>Tanzanian</b> police also accused him of working with PIDE (Portugal's secret police) to assassinate Mondlane. Kavandame himself surrendered to the Portuguese in April of that year.|$|E

5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} to negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the <b>Tanzanian</b> city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved {{in the affairs of}} other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with <b>Tanzanian</b> and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the <b>Tanzanian</b> genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|Magdalena Moshi also {{received}} a universality place for the women's 50 m freestyle, but {{failed to make the}} semi-finals at the Games, placing equal 67th (with Angelika Ouedraogo of Burkino Faso) overall. She had been placed in heat four, which was won by Colleen Furgeson of the Marshall Islands, and came in fifth with a time of 29.44. Born in Australia, but raised in Tanzania, she trained in the country of her birth and was a veteran of the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics as Tanzania's first female swimmer. This made her one of only two <b>Tanzanian</b> women to have competed in three editions of the Games as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Since 1964, when it competed {{under the}} banner of Tanganyika, Tanzania had sent athletes to twelve editions of the Summer Olympic Games. On 7 July 2016, it became the first country to submit its {{official}} team for the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The nation chose judoka Andrew Thomas Mlugu as its flagbearer in the opening ceremony. A total of seven Tanzanians, five men and two women, travelled to Rio de Janeiro and competed in three different sports: track and field, judo, and swimming. Alphonce Felix Simbu, who finished fifth in the men's marathon, was the nation's most successful competitor at the Games, and thus the nation failed to win its first Olympic medal since 1980. Nonetheless, he was selected to carry the <b>Tanzanian</b> flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>Tanzanian</b> athletes, {{three men}} and one woman, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, all in marathon events. The lone woman was Sara Ramadhani, whose three-year suspension from international competition for testing positive for banned substances at the 2014 Commonwealth Games ended in early 2016. She finished 121st out of 157 participants in the women's marathon. Of the three men, Fabiano Joseph Naasi {{was the only one}} with previous Olympic experience, having taken part in the 5000 and 10,000 m events at the 2004 Games and the 10,000 m in 2008. He had also won a bronze medal in the 10,000 m competition at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and was the World Half Marathon Champion in 2005. In Rio he was 112th out of 155 athletes in the men's marathon. Saidi Makula, who had competed in only two full marathons prior to the Olympics, fared better in 43rd place. Alphonce Felix Simbu, who had been 12th in the marathon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, placed fifth, one minute and ten seconds behind Galen Rupp of the United States, the bronze medalist, and 2 minutes, 31 seconds behind winner Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya.|$|E

50|$|In March 2007, the UraMin {{site was}} {{inspected}} by the Director for the Ministry of Mining and Energy, Mr Guy Ngaïkomessé. Also present were the Regional Director for Mining, the Assistant Commander of the Mining Brigade, the Commander of the Mboumou Police Force {{as well as}} several police and gendarme officers. They found that the UraMin team consisted of six <b>Tanzanians,</b> two Europeans and one Cameroonian. The <b>Tanzanians</b> and the Cameroonian did not have visas for the country and were brought to Bangui for regularisation.|$|R
5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the <b>Tanzanian</b> border.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new <b>Tanzanian</b> government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A multi-party system was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E
5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} <b>Tanzanian</b> border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E
