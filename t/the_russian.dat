5|$|A naval {{confrontation}} {{took place}} between Russian and Georgian ships on 10 August. According to <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Ministry of Defence, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Navy ships {{off the coast of}} Abkhazia. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Black Sea Fleet on 10 August. The Black Sea Fleet, which participated in the military conflict {{for the first time since}} 1945, had probably departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Staff of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> left.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> {{revolutions}} split also <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> {{army officers}} politically and {{their attitude toward}} the Finnish civil war varied; Mikhail Svechnikov led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and Konstantin Yeremejev <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> forces in the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary underlings and co-operated with the former colleague General Mannerheim, assisting the Whites in the disarmament of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was to beat the Finnish Red rebels and <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> troops supporting them.|$|E

5|$|By 1917, the American diocese was {{the largest}} in <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> Orthodox Church. It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350.

5|$|By {{contrast}} <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> forces' morale {{was extremely}} high. <b>The</b> <b>Russian</b> commanders had ample experience in siege operations; Paskevich himself had captured {{at least six}} fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas-Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.|$|E

Schmitt met with <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> forces {{at the great}} abbey by Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders concocted a plan to encircle Édouard Mortier's French force near Dürenstein.

5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army {{emerged from}} the woods, with most of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians {{emerged from the}} woods, and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest.
