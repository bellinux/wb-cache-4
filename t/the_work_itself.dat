5|$|Mendelssohn {{originally}} {{proposed the}} idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many {{saying that there}} were beautiful scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a short description of the abbott's death.|$|E

50|$|Beyond Japan, {{the term}} is used to {{describe}} a commonly pornographic genre of eroge, comics, and anime which includes characters that show both primary sexual characteristics. In today's language it refers almost exclusively to characters who have an overall feminine body, but have both female and male genitalia (although testicles are not always present).

25|$|The TtEias (1979) were {{intended}} {{not only to}} create volume, but to draw lines that are nearly invisible. True to Neo-concrete art, {{there is a relationship}} between the viewer and the art as the lighting of the prisms changes according to the viewer's position in the exhibition space, accentuating the spatial relationship between the viewer and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself.</b> The spectacular shimmering lines of TtEias(1979) and the effect they produce in the viewers has been compared in lightness and weight to cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was {{responsible}} for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next logical step, for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This {{turned out not to be}} the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but to do <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E

The role of art and <b>the</b> art <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> are inextricably linked. If we look at the role of art as analogous to a wheel we can look at the argument thus : the wheel exists in order to roll. Its function is to roll. The wheel's function of rolling informs us about its existence. Function and the wheel's existence cannot be separated. The role of art and <b>the</b> art <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> are inextricably tied. Intro. p. 1...|$|R

The bulk of iron ore mined in Furness {{had been sent}} there and the Brogdens became aware that Sir Robert Price, {{the owner of the}} Glamorgan Iron and Coal Works at Tondu, was in difficulties. In December 1853 they purchased for £10,000 the leases of the land and mines that he held. In the following January they purchased <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>itself</b> for £35,000. In July they acquired the leases of other farms and mines previously held by Sir Robert.|$|R
25|$|In 1168, Maimonides (Rambam) {{published}} a comprehensive {{commentary on the}} Mishnah. It was written in transliterated Judeo-Arabic (using Hebrew letters) {{and was one of}} the first commentaries of its kind. In it, Rambam condensed the associated Talmudical debates, and offered his conclusions in a number of undecided issues. Of particular significance are the various introductory sections – as well as the introduction to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> – these are widely quoted in other works on the Mishnah, and on the Oral law in general. Perhaps the most famous is his introduction to the tenth chapter of tractate Sanhedrin where he enumerates the thirteen fundamental beliefs of Judaism.|$|E
25|$|This lengthy-titled artwork {{features}} a large Tiger Shark suspended in formaldehyde, {{the most well-known}} of his series ‘Natural History’. This series is said to “contain some of the artist’s most widely recognized and important works”. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate blocks. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself</b> is very simplistic, featuring only the shark in a watery substance, which at first glance looks clear like glass. The piece itself is fairly old, having been created in 1991. Because of this, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal’s body, showing signs of decay.|$|E
25|$|Among these sources, it is {{the most}} famous one, the Hrólfr Kraki's saga, which is most {{different}} from Beowulf, and a notable difference is that Hrothgar leaves the rule of Denmark to his younger brother Halga and moves to Northumbria. The focus is consequently on the Hrólfr Kraki's saga when a scholar questions the comparison of Hrothgar and other characters from Beowulf with counterparts in Scandinavian tradition. Scandinavian sources have added some information that appear in Beowulf studies, without having any founding in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself,</b> such as the information that Halga was, or probably was, Hroðulf's father. Another example is the existence of a woman named Yrsa, who, however, has been transposed to a role she never had in any source texts, that of Hrothgar's sister.|$|E

25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself,</b> which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
25|$|Mill {{preferred}} {{to take a}} more theoretical approach to social subjects than the empirical one common at the time. His best known literary work is his History of British India, in which he describes the acquisition of the Indian Empire by England and later the United Kingdom. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself,</b> and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's History of India by notable economist Amartya Sen.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>itself,</b> responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E
