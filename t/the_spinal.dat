5|$|The fibres {{that form}} <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> {{accessory}} nerve are formed by {{lower motor neurons}} located in the upper segments of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord. This cluster of neurons, called <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord, and stretches from where <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard for anyone who has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} <b>spinal</b> cord, {{which makes}} up 2/3 of <b>the</b> entire <b>spinal</b> cord, gets its blood supply from <b>the</b> anterior <b>spinal</b> artery. This artery in turn receives its {{blood from the}} different radiculospinal branches, which are formed from the aorta and vertebral arteries. As {{the largest of the}} radiculospinal artery branches, the Artery of Adamkiewicz provides a large amount of blood to <b>the</b> anterior <b>spinal</b> artery, thereby also supplying a good amount to <b>the</b> anterior <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|R
40|$|The femoral nerves {{were studied}} in newborn goats of Saanen breed (22 males and 11 females) that were {{collected}} after natural death and fixed with 10 % formaldehyde solution. In males the femoral nerve arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 4 and L 5 in eight animals (36 %); in six animals (27 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 5 and L 6; in five animals (23 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 5; in two animals (9 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 4, L 5 and L 6 {{and in one}} animal (5 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 5 and L 6 and <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of S 1. In females the femoral nerve arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 4 and L 5 in seven animals (64 %); in three animals (27 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 5 and L 6 and in one animal (9 %) it arose from <b>the</b> ventral <b>spinal</b> branches of L 4, L 5 and L 6. In all animals, the femoral nerves were distributed in different branches to the major and minor psoas, femoris quadriceps, sartorius and pectinius muscles...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{cervical}} <b>spinal</b> nerves {{emerge from}} above the cervical vertebrae. For example, <b>the</b> cervical <b>spinal</b> nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.|$|R
5|$|At {{each level}} of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> column, spinal nerves branch off from either side of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord that was damaged corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury {{is defined as the}} lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> {{column and}} reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E

50|$|Nervous system {{problems}} may occur in Paget's disease, resulting from increased pressure on <b>the</b> brain, <b>spinal</b> cord, or nerves, and reduced {{blood flow to}} <b>the</b> brain and <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> {{accessory nerve}} itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. <b>The</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> component. <b>The</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
40|$|Although {{olfactory}} ensheathing cells (OECs) {{are used}} to promote repair in <b>the</b> injured <b>spinal</b> cord, little is known of their phenotype in this environment. This study examined the effect of <b>the</b> injured <b>spinal</b> cord on OEC morphology and gene expression. For in situ experiments OECs were encapsulated in porous polymer tubes and implanted into <b>the</b> lesioned rat <b>spinal</b> cord. Adult male hooded Wistar rats (300 - 350 g) were anaesthetised with isoflurane maintained at 2. 5...|$|R

5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs, larger {{vascular}} malformations) {{occur in}} larger organs, predominantly the lungs (50%), liver (30–70%) {{and the brain}} (cerebral AVMs, 10%), with a very small proportion (<1%) having AVMs in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{arterial}} bubbles {{may reach}} <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord and grow on site from local gas and produce spinal neurological symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five {{vertebrae}} (L1–L5), sometimes including the sacrum. In between these vertebrae are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the vertebrae from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord. Nerves come from and go to <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord through specific openings between the vertebrae, providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E
5|$|The medulla, {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>spinal</b> cord, {{contains}} many small nuclei {{involved in a}} wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting, heart rate and digestive processes.|$|E
