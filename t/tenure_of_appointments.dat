5000|$|Prior to {{formulation}} of revised law termed the University of Nairobi Act <b>of</b> 1985, <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> Vice-Chancellorship candidates was {{based largely on}} qualifications, seniority and <b>tenure.</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>appointments,</b> rather than competitive process {{during the early years}} of the university's establishment was considered fair and was extremely apt, given the small number of PhDs in the country prior to the 1980s. The 1985 Act provided that Chancellorship of the University of Nairobi can be by the President of Kenya, or anyone the President determines fit for the position. Chancellorship and other university appointments made by a president were and are subject to termination once the appointing presidency terminates.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "sheriff" [...] is a {{contraction}} {{of the term}} [...] "shire reeve". The term, from the Old English scīrgerefa, designated a royal official responsible for keeping the peace (a [...] "reeve") throughout a shire or county {{on behalf of the}} king. The term was preserved in England notwithstanding the Norman Conquest. The office of sheriff had its origins in the 10th century; the office reached the height of its power under the Norman kings. While the sheriffs originally had been men of great standing at court, the thirteenth century saw a process whereby the office devolved on significant men within each county, usually landowners. The Provisions of Oxford (1258) established a yearly <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> office. The <b>appointments</b> and duties <b>of</b> the sheriffs in England and Wales were redefined by the Sheriffs Act 1887. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the office previously known as sheriff was retitled [...] "high sheriff".|$|R

50|$|The Council <b>of</b> <b>Appointment</b> had {{its origins}} in the fear of too much popular {{influence}} in the government. The first New York Constitution was aristocratic and elitist in spirit. As long as the governor alone nominated appointees, he had as much power over the State's patronage as a medieval king. On the other side, during the long <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> Governor George Clinton, very rarely an office holder was removed, and the Council only filled vacancies as they occurred by resignation, death, declination of re-appointment, or term limit.|$|R

30|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of this argumentation, {{it might be possible}} that the relation between CEO tenure and CSQ partially found in previous studies is based on effects actually stemming from the one-time event of CEO succession. If CEOs’ CSQ was lower after their initial appointment and higher after at least 1  year <b>of</b> <b>tenure,</b> which is supported by our results, regression analysis testing the effects <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> would yield the result that ongoing tenure progressively increases CSQ—although the underlying effect stems only from the succession event. Misleadingly, the results would indicate that, for instance, the difference between 2  years <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> and 3  years would cause an increase of CSQ similar to the difference between the year <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> and 1  year <b>of</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{public sector}} in Nigeria is irrefutably beset with gross  {{incompetence}} and ineffective management. Perplexing difficulties endure in the Nigerian public sector {{in spite of}} a number of reform programmes that have been designed to enhance efficient and effective service delivery for almost two decades. The fact that public service has failed dismally to achieve its laudable objectives is the reason for the vote of no confidence passed on its administrators by majority of the Nigerian populace. The article examines the dilemma of accountability and good governance in Nigeria and demonstrates that the critical point in achieving meaningful developments in the country intrinsically lay with improved service delivery in the public sector. The basic reason why the public service has become the scorn of the people is because for too long, both the government and public servants have paid lip service to the crucial issue of effective and efficient service delivery. The article argues that improved service delivery will improve both the performance and the image of public service and re-awaken the citizens’ interest and trust in them to do business with public servants. It suggests that  in order to bring sanity back to the Nigerian Public Service,  all unprofessional tendencies such as ethnicity bias and nepotism in appointments and promotions, lack <b>of</b> security <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> office, and <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> non-career public servants into key positions in the public service must stop. Also,  effective service delivery must be tailored to the circumstances of Nigeria. The study made use of secondary data obtained from various sources. It therefore concludes that without a reawakening of the culture of accountability and transparency lost over the years, the trusting relationship needed to forge {{between the government and the}} governed for the actualization of good governance will not materialize...|$|R
40|$|The {{judicial}} appointment {{process is}} one of essential elements for maintaining judicial independence and public confidence of a court. This article analyses the practices <b>of</b> judicial <b>appointment</b> process exercised by three different main state institutions in selecting constitutional justice in Indonesia where the mechanism and process for selecting them have been implemented differently. It also examines the <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> constitutional justice, which is a five-year term and can be renewed for one term only, {{that may lead to}} another problem concerning the reselection process of incumbent constitutional justices for their second term. The article concludes that the judicial <b>appointment</b> process and <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> constitutional justice in Indonesia have to be improved. It suggests that if the proposing state institutions could not meet the principles of transparency, participation, objective and accountable required by the Constitutional Court Law, the judicial appointment process should be conducted by creating an independent Selection Committee or establishing a cooperation with the Judicial Commission. Additionally, the <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> constitutional justices should also be revised for a unrenewable term with a longer period of nine or twelve years...|$|R
6000|$|Always favoring {{practical}} reforms, I respectfully {{call your}} attention to one abuse of long standing which I {{would like to see}} remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would have it go beyond the mere fixing <b>of</b> the <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> office of clerks and employees who do not require [...] "the advice and consent of the Senate" [...] to make their appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the tenure, but the manner <b>of</b> making all <b>appointments.</b> There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of Departments as that <b>of</b> <b>appointments,</b> nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men, for public place.
