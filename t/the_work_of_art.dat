25|$|Following Duchamp {{during the}} first half of the twentieth century, a {{significant}} shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> or, if <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.|$|E

25|$|Art historians often examine work in {{the context}} of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with {{consideration}} of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and symbolism. In short, this approach examines <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> {{in the context of}} the world within which it was created.|$|E
25|$|Objectified {{cultural}} capital comprises the person's property (e.g. {{a work of}} art, scientific instruments, etc.) that can be transmitted for economic profit (buying-and-selling) and for symbolically conveying the possession of {{cultural capital}} facilitated by owning such things.

25|$|Breaking {{down the}} {{distinction}} between the fine and applied arts was a key aim of the movement, and Birmingham Group artists practiced across a variety of disciplines, producing stained glass, jewellery, metalwork, embroidery, hand printed books and furniture as well as pictures. In painting they emphasised the role of a picture {{in the context of a}} wider work or space, often producing murals or frescos for specific buildings, presenting easel pictures in custom-built frames considered integral to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> and working in exacting media such as tempera or watercolour on vellum, where the creation of the materials was an essential part of the creation of the work.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, Pollock's radical {{approach}} to painting revolutionized {{the potential for}} all Contemporary art following him. Pollock realized the journey toward making {{a work of art}} was as important as <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near {{the turn of the century}} via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined artmaking during the mid-century. Pollock's move from easel painting and conventionality liberated his contemporaneous artists and following artists. They realized Pollock's process— working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing- blasted artmaking beyond prior boundaries. Abstract expressionism expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense, the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt and others, opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of following artworks.|$|E

His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary.

25|$|The poet-philosopher {{left behind}} a large {{manuscript}} collection, a personal library {{and a set of}} works due for publishing. His book collection was split into individual documentary funds, some located in France and others in Romania. In February 1930, Benjamin Fondane explained that he did not consider revisiting his land of birth until such time as his earlier volumes would be printed, indicating that these included (in addition to Priveliști): Ferestre spre Europa, Imagini și scriitori români ("Images and Romanian Writers"), Caietele unui inactual ("The Notebooks of an Outdated Man"), Probleme vesele ("Merry Problems"), Dialoguri ("Dialogues") and an introduction to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> critic Walter Pater. Among Fondane's other Romanian works, unpublished {{at the time of his}} death, were the prose poem Herța ("Hertza"), Note dintr-un confesional and many other prose fragments and poems, all preserved in Daniel's manuscript collection. According to Paul Daniel, part of the poet's book collection in Romania was left in the care of literary critic Lucian Boz, who sold it upon his departure for Australia. In France, the copyright to Fondane's work was passed on in the late 20th century to scholar Michel Carassou, who was personally involved in several publication projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet {{they all seem to}} agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E

25|$|New Bearings in English Poetry was {{the first}} major volume of {{criticism}} Leavis was to publish, and it provides insight into his own critical positions. He has been frequently (but often erroneously) associated with the American school of New Critics, a group which advocated close reading and detailed textual analysis of poetry over, or even instead of, an interest in the mind and personality of the poet, sources, the history of ideas and political and social implications. Although there are undoubtedly similarities between Leavis's approach to criticism and that of the New Critics (most particularly in that both take <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> itself as the primary focus of critical discussion), Leavis is ultimately distinguishable from them, since he never adopted (and was explicitly hostile to) a theory of the poem as a self-contained and self-sufficient aesthetic and formal artifact, isolated from the society, culture and tradition from which it emerged. New Bearings, devoted principally to Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, was an attempt to identify the essential new achievements in modern poetry. It also discussed at length and praised the work of Ronald Bottrall, whose importance was not to be confirmed by readers and critics.|$|E
500|$|As {{the poem}} {{comes to a}} close, the narrator once again {{addresses}} the urn as a single object. However, his tone becomes sharper as he seeks answers from <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> that it appears unable to answer. In the final couplet, the poet provides a line for the urn, which complicates the narrative and has generated a multitude of critical responses as to the author's intent: [...] "Beauty is truth—truth beauty / that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know" [...] (lines 49–50).|$|E

[...] Elsewhere, he praised the work as having a [...] "formidable dynamism" [...] and an [...] "unequaled vitality", containing a [...] "revolution" [...] in narrative structure. He thought that it served as a [...] "perfect metaphor" [...] for the theories of German philosopher Walter Benjamin published in <b>The</b> <b>Work</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1936), which Hergé had not read.|$|E

[...] He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and [...] "did virtually the same things" [...] she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.|$|E
500|$|Theory of Literature was {{influenced}} by Russian formalism, a school of thought which sought to examine literature (or, more precisely, what formalist-turned-structuralist Roman Jakobson termed literariness) as an autonomous body, and the American New Criticism, which likewise denied external influences. The book borrowed formalism's concepts of an aesthetic function and dominance of different elements of language. Unlike Russian formalism, however, Wellek and Warren's theory recognized the possibility of factors outside the work being studied, although Wellek and Warren continued to emphasize aspects within the work itself. Also unlike their forerunners, Wellek and Warren saw aesthetic value as not the defamiliarization of the mundane, but an interaction among the strata derived from Roman Ingarden's work: the phonological (sound) level at the base, then semantic (meaning), and the [...] "world" [...] created by literature. This last strata they divided into paradigms and [...] "metaphysical qualities", the level which a reader contemplates. They did not, however, accept Ingarden's teachings as a whole, writing that Ingarden [...] "analyze <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> without reference to values", a system which they found untenable.|$|E
