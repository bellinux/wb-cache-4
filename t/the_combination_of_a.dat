5|$|After the {{disappointment}} of the Gaspart era, <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new young president, Joan Laporta, {{and a young}} new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o and Rafael Márquez, combined with homegrown Spanish players Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E

5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other shopping centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E

5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is formed by <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form {{it and they}} are unable to digest lactose.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E

5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, {{the painting is}} an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the battalions of the Australian Corps {{were removed}} from the line for rest on 5 October, after a request from the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. They had been {{severely}} depleted and were suffering from acute manpower shortages as a result of <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{decrease in the number of}} volunteers from Australia and the decision to grant home leave to men who had served for over four years. Subsequently, when the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, the Australian Corps had not returned to the front and was still in the rear reorganising and training. With the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began, and men were slowly repatriated back to Australia. The process took a considerable period of time, though, and a large number of men were able to undertake tertiary and vocational training in England and France to prepare for their return to civilian life. Finally, as numbers dwindled, the battalion was disbanded on 4 June 1919.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E

5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large high {{pressure}} system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico; wave heights reached 15feet (4.60m). On November 11, a ship reported sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h), although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls. In Key West, the storm's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28inches (591mm); 13.58inches (345mm) fell within six hours. It remains the record 24-hour November rainfall total {{for the city}} as of 2012. The previous record was set in 1954. The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front, which {{also contributed to the}} deluge. Schools and most businesses were closed, while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport; authorities urged residents to stay home. Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{stationary}} front and significant moisture from Hurricane Igor resulted in unprecedented rainfall across parts of eastern Newfoundland, leading to widespread flooding. In Bonavista, more than 10in (250mm) {{was estimated to}} have fallen between September20 and 21. In St. Lawrence, a confirmed 9.37in (238mm) of rain fell, ranking Igor as the third-wettest tropical cyclone in Canadian history. The widespread nature of heavy rains ranked the storm as a 1-in-100 year event. Similar to the rainfall, winds across eastern Newfoundland were exacerbated by {{the interaction of the}} front and Igor. In Cape Pine, near where the center of Igor tracked, sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts to 107mph (172km/h) battered the area. No records for sustained winds or gusts were broken; however, it was noted as a 1-in-50 year event even with powerful winter storms taken into account. Along the coast, Igor produced a storm tide of 3.5ft (1.1m). Additionally, offshore waves reached immense heights, measured up to 83.6ft (25.5m); one buoy reported a wave of 92ft (28m) but data is subject to further analysis to verify it.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Humberto {{are from the}} {{remnants}} of a frontal trough—the same that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle—that moved offshore south Florida on September 5. <b>The</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak surface trough and an upper-level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Tracking slowly west-northwestward, unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development. By late on September 11, environmental conditions became more favorable, and the following morning convection increased over the disturbance. Tracking around the western periphery of a mid-level ridge, the system turned on a slow northwest drift and quickly organized. Radar imagery reported loose banding features, and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation; based on the observations, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine, while located roughly 60miles (100km) southeast of Matagorda, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hauptmann Koch divided his force {{into four}} assault groups. Group Granite, under Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig, {{composed}} of eighty-five men in eleven gliders whose task {{would be to}} assault and capture Fort Eben Emael; Group Steel, commanded by Oberleutnant Gustav Altmann, and formed of ninety-two men and nine gliders, would capture the Veldwezelt bridge; Group Concrete, commanded by Leutnant Gerhard Schacht and composed of ninety-six men in eleven gliders, would capture the Vroenhoven bridge; and Group Iron, under Leutnant Martin Schächter, composed of ninety men in ten gliders, who would capture the Kanne bridge. The crucial element for the assault force, particularly Group Granite, was time. It was believed that <b>the</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> noiseless approach by the gliders used by the assault force, {{and the lack of}} a declaration of war by the German government, would give the attackers the element of surprise. However, German estimates were that this would last, at the most, for sixty minutes, after which the superior numbers of the Belgian forces defending the fort and the bridges, as well as any reinforcements sent to the area, would begin to come to bear against the relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops. The German plan, therefore, was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti-aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible, and at all costs to put out of action the long-range artillery pieces which covered the three bridges. The destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes; within this time the airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders, cover the distance to the guns, fix the explosive charges to the barrels of the guns and detonate them, all while under enemy fire.|$|E
