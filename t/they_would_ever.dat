5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E
5|$|These initial concerns, however, {{were short}} lived, {{at least in}} the {{beginning}} as the British government provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue. Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties. To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products, at least initially, however, in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods, thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living. This understanding proved particularly beneficial for the wool and wheat industries, where the British government undertook to buy Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> receive them.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May Haig {{thought the}} Germans “uncannily quiet”. At Abbeville (2 May) {{it was agreed}} that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if {{necessary}} and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French. Contingency plans were made (11 May) although it is unclear that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have been executed.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 the Australian {{economy was}} small but very nearly the most propserous {{in the world}} per capita; it {{depended}} on the export of wool and mutton. London provided assurances that it would underwrite {{a large amount of}} the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands.

25|$|Several {{underlying}} {{themes were}} apparent throughout the show's run. For the characters, {{working at the}} camp was either a step up or step down the ladder of success in show-business. The younger staff (e.g. Spike Dixon and the Yellowcoats) were keen and enthusiastic about their jobs, which they saw as a lucky break {{at the start of}} their careers. For the older members of the staff (e.g. Yvonne, Barry and Mr Partridge), the camp was a step down from past glories. Caught in the middle were staff members close to middle age (e.g. Ted Bovis and Fred Quilley) who still believed they could achieve fame and fortune, and were reluctant to accept that working at a holiday camp was the best <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> do.|$|E

500|$|An {{interview}} with Shearsmith and Pemberton was published on British comedy website Chortle.co.uk after Inside No. 9 won the Chortle Award for best TV show. The pair {{were asked if}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> consider writing an episode with a happy ending. Shearsmith responded by saying [...] "Yes, {{because that would be}} the biggest surprise of all ... But last year we had the Last Gasp, and that had quite a happy ending - and people hated that one!" [...] Similarly, Pemberton suggested that [...] "people are disappointed if we don't deliver something horrible".|$|E
500|$|Idlewild South {{was issued}} by Atco and Capricorn Records on September 23, 1970, {{less than a}} year after the band's debut album. It sold only [...] "marginally better, in spite of the band's growing {{national}} reputation, and included songs that would become staples of its repertoire—and eventually of rock radio." [...] Jim Hawkins, engineer of the album, remembered that Walden informed him that Idlewild South opened to 50,000 copies in its first week, before settling in at 1,000 per week. While the album did help boost the band's popularity, the Allman Brothers' name really grew in fame due to their live performances. Walden doubted the band's future, worrying whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band's relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger.|$|E
500|$|Most airmen doubted <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> {{get out of}} Buchenwald {{because their}} {{documents}} were stamped with the acronym [...] "DIKAL" [...] (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or [...] "not {{to be transferred to}} another camp". At great risk, Lamason and Burney secretly smuggled a note through a trusted Russian prisoner, who worked at the nearby Nohra airfield, to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp. The message requested in part, that an officer pass the information to Berlin, and for the Luftwaffe to intercede on behalf of the airmen. Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would not want their captured men treated in the same way; he also knew that the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.|$|E

500|$|The {{band played}} {{continuously}} in 1970, performing over 300 dates {{on the road}} traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later, a Winnebago, nicknamed the Wind Bag. Walden doubted the band’s future, worrying whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band's relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger. The close proximity of the Winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group, and all in the group, {{with the exception of}} the brothers, were struggling to make a living. In one instance, touring manager Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band; he later cited temporary insanity. Later that year, Duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show. [...] "Idlewild South", produced by Tom Dowd, was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including New York, Miami, and Macon, and contained two of the band's best-known songs, [...] "Midnight Rider" [...] (later a hit for various artists, including a Top 20 solo effort by Gregg) and [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed", which became one of the band's famous concert numbers.|$|E
500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got a little too much else going on, and who knows if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Although some American {{divisions}} {{were now}} serving with the British forces, Haig thought Pershing [...] "very obstinate and stupid" [...] {{for refusing to}} integrate US troops (1 May) with Allied units (an ironic complaint in view of his reluctance to integrate British troops with French).

2500|$|The harsh {{response}} from the strictly Orthodox came as no surprise. Moshe Schick wondered, [...] "why shall we not disclose {{the truth about the}} sentence of these men... as they have blasphemed against the Divinity of the Law, they are no Israelites and equal to Gentiles". Yet they also managed to antagonize more moderate progressives. Both S. L. Rapoport and Zecharias Frankel strongly condemned Braunschweig. Another discontented party were Christian missionaries, who feared Reform on two accounts: it could stem the massive tide of conversions, and loosen Jewish piety in favor of liberal, semi-secularized religion that they opposed among Christians as well, reducing the possibility <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> accept new dogma fully.|$|E

5000|$|The Swedish non-aligned policy {{during this}} period was founded on the {{assumption}} that there were two opposing powers in the Baltic, Germany and the Soviet Union; Because these two powers needed to guard against each other, the hope was that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> only <b>ever</b> be able to deploy minor forces against Sweden or other non-aligned countries. It was this expectation which made the defence of a small country feasible.

Celestia reveals that she had transformed herself into Yggdrasil to prevent Zenus from destroying the Protectorate, intending to prove that the mortals were capable of kindness.

2500|$|Elizabeth Ellsworth, a {{professor}} of media studies, eavesdropped on several visitors to the exhibition, noting {{that because of the}} exhibition's placement in a self-contained space accessed by a staircase {{at the far end of}} the museum's first floor, the visitors were primarily self-selected as those who would be intrigued enough by such an idea in the first place to actually seek it out. [...] According to her report, the reactions were wide-ranging, from the number of women who teased their male companions about whether <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> consider wearing skirts (to which several men responded that they would) to the man who said, [...] "A caftan after a shower or in the gym? Can you imagine? 'Excuse me! [...] Coming through!'". [...] An adolescent girl rejected in disgust the notion that skirts were similar to the wide pants worn by hip-hop artists. Two elderly women called the idea [...] "utterly ridiculous".
