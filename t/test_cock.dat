2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the <b>test</b> <b>cock</b> on tube number 5 {{was blocked by}} some enamel paint so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open. Prickers to clear the test cocks had been {{provided}} {{but they were not}} used. This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the [...] "Shut" [...] position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the inner door of the tube being opened. The inrush of water caused the bow of the submarine to sink to the seabed [...] below the surface. How the outer door (bow cap) to Tube 5 became open to the sea is a question that will probably never be answered, Woods maintained that until at least 10 minutes before he opened the tube all the indicators were at [...] "Shut".|$|E
50|$|The bow {{caps and}} {{shutters}} are mechanically {{linked to a}} hydraulically operated drive rod from within the torpedo compartment. The bow cap opens first behind the shutter, which then folds back against it forming a smooth exit tube. Interlocks prevent the doors at both ends being opened {{at the same time}} but the inner door is also provided with a <b>test</b> <b>cock</b> to check whether the tube is full of water before opening and remains held nearly closed by the swing bolt after the locking ring is released. The tube internal diameter is 22.5 in, wider than the torpedo, which is designed as a loose fit inside the tube. Torpedoes could be fired either electrically or with compressed air.|$|E

50|$|In many countries. {{approved}} backflow prevention assemblies {{are required}} by law, and must be installed in accordance with plumbing or building codes. A typical backflow assembly has <b>test</b> <b>cocks</b> and shut-off valves, and must be tested when installed, if relocated or repaired, and also on a periodic basis.|$|R
25|$|The {{cause of}} the loss of Thetis was also used in the 1968 film Ice Station Zebra, where the {{character}} played by Patrick McGoohan describes a method of sabotaging a submarine by blocking the tube <b>test</b> <b>cocks,</b> allowing the inner door to be opened with the outer door also open.|$|R
50|$|Small valves {{may be so}} compact as to be barely noticeable, {{particularly}} when they are integrated into the bodies of existing taps (faucets). Larger check valves may be installed with ball valves at the ends, for isolation and <b>testing.</b> Often, <b>test</b> <b>cocks</b> (very small ball valves) are in place to attach test equipment for evaluating whether the double check assembly is still functional.|$|R
50|$|A reduced {{pressure}} zone device is tested with a device called a differential gauge. This gauge uses hoses {{attached to the}} various <b>test</b> <b>cocks</b> of the RPZD and checks {{to be certain that}} the check valve springs as well as the relief valve spring are not fouled and are working properly. There is a variety of manufacturers of these gauges, but most utilize either a three-valve or a five-valve design to test the RPZD in different ways.|$|R
50|$|A {{pressure}} {{vacuum breaker}} (PVB) {{is a type}} of backflow prevention device, used to keep non-potable (or contaminated) water from entering the water supply. A PVB is similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB), except that the PVB contains a spring-loaded poppet. This makes it acceptable for applications that are high hazard or where valves are downstream. Pressure vacuum breakers must be protected from freezing when installed outdoors. PVBs usually have <b>test</b> <b>cocks,</b> to which specially-calibrated gauges are attached, {{in order to ensure that}} they are functioning properly.|$|R
50|$|The device {{consists}} of two independent check valves, plumbed in series, with a pressure monitored chamber between. The chamber is maintained at a pressure that {{is lower than the}} water supply pressure, but high enough to be useful downstream. The reduced pressure is guaranteed by a differential pressure relief valve, which automatically relieves excess pressure in the chamber by discharging to a drain. Four <b>test</b> <b>cocks</b> are installed to allow an inspector to verify proper operation of the valve with a differential pressure meter. Two gate valves (one before and one after the RPZD) are provided to allow for testing and repair.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of 15 of the commoner human leucocyte antigens was determined in 18 patients with Crohn's disease and in 16 patients with ulcerative colitis, using an in-vitro lymphocyte cytotoxicity <b>test</b> (Harris, Wentzel, <b>Cocking,</b> Dodsworth, and Ukaejiofo, 1970). The overall results showed that, {{with the exception of}} human leucocyte antigen 3 in patients with Crohn's disease, in neither disease was there any major difference in any of the other antigen frequencies compared with a panel of 50 healthy controls. Nor was there an excess {{frequency of}} any particular antigen occurring in both Crohn's disease and colitis...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to stimulate}} the {{development}} of critical thinking (CT) have long been intertwined with controversies over its conceptualization. Several scholars give a comprehensive overview of CT by suggesting that it includes a cognitive skill dimension and a dispositional dimension (e. g., Ennis, 1996; Halpern, 2014). The inclusion of the dispositional dimension {{is based on the}} assumption that acquisition of cognitive skills alone does not suffice for reflective and reasonable thinking. However, the distinction between mastery of a set of cognitive skills and dispositions has been less clear. Some suggest a pure contrast between the two claiming that one must be disposed to think critically as well as have the skills to do so (Ennis, 1996; Halpern, 2014). Accordingly, a list of cognitive skills in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, and explanation, and dispositional elements such as inquisitiveness, self-confidence, open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, flexibility in considering alternatives, and fair-mindedness are generally suggested (Facione, 1990; Halpern, 2014). Ennis (1996) particularly argues that CT skills and CT dispositions should be viewed independently because someone could have the disposition to, for example, clarify and seek understanding without having the ability to ask pointed questions. However, Perkins and colleagues (1993) reject the usual dispositions-skills dual contrast, and conceive disposition as an overarching construct encompassing three components: inclination, sensitivity and ability. They define inclination as the tendency to engage in a given behavior due to motivation and habits, sensitivity as the feeling for opportunities for implementing the appropriate behavior, and ability as the actual skill to deploy the behavior (Perkins et al., 1993). In contrast, others (Facione, 1990; McPeck, 1990) embrace a composite account of CT skills and CT dispositions without drawing a visible line between the two. The composite account holds the view that the term “CT skills” includes in its meaning a reference to CT dispositions besides the acquisition of sets of mental procedures. For example, McPeck (1990) insists that a person who is proficient in a given skill can be said to have the disposition to execute that skill as one must develop the disposition to use those skills. Based on data collected for a research project on the design, implementation and evaluation of learning environments for CT, we will discuss in the conference our views of CT skills and CT dispositions and how we translated those views in designing and evaluating learning environments for CT. For the purpose of our research, Halpern’s definition of CT is adopted: CT as the use of a set of cognitive strategies that increase the probability of a desirable outcome (Halpern, 2014). A domain-specific CT <b>test</b> (Tiruneh, De <b>Cock,</b> Weldeslassie, Elen, & Janssen, 2016) and domain-general CT test (Halpern, 2010), which are assumed to evaluate both the cognitive and dispositional dimensions of CT were administered to evaluate the effectiveness of systematically designed learning environments. The advantages and limitations of our experiences will be discussed and future directions on the dual vs. composite views of CT skills and CT dispositions will be elaborated with respect to CT instructional approaches and assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
