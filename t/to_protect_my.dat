Her intervention helped secure his release from jail in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Kingsolver says, [...] "I {{never wanted to}} be famous, and still don't, [...] the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most". She said she created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones, [...] "as a defence <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>my</b> family from misinformation. Wikipedia abhors a vacuum. If you don't define yourself, it will get done for you in colourful ways".|$|E

One reward I get in being martyred I get to take ten members of my family to heaven who were destined for hell, but first I also must be martyred.

2500|$|Joan Quigley {{first met}} Nancy Reagan in the 1970s on The Merv Griffin Show. After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people can understand what it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun.... I was doing everything I could think of <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>my</b> husband and keep him alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{involved}} in top level football in 1972, Farmer {{returned to the}} VFL {{as coach of the}} Geelong Football Club from 1973 to 1975. Farmer and the club’s committee had an increasingly strained relationship, and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success, and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict, and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, “When the going gets tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. I do my best in football and I have no time <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>my</b> back, so it's left wide open. Maybe that’s a lot of my trouble.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The three spirit souls {{are located}} beneath the liver. They look like {{human beings and}} wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go {{wandering}} about. At this time, lie down with your feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart {{about the size of}} an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: [...] "Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me!

That is mine. No, no, little greedy Mulgar; we share together, or I have all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said, 'I {{have indeed}} acted towards you with thoughtless cruelty. I brought {{you from your}} {{paternal}} fields, {{and the protection of}} a generous and kind landlord, and when I had subjected you to all the rigour of military discipline, I shunned to bear my own share of the burden, and wandered from the duties I had undertaken, leaving alike those whom it was <b>my</b> business <b>to</b> <b>protect,</b> and <b>my</b> own reputation, to suffer under the artifices of villainy.

60|$|I {{leaned against}} the wall and cried. It {{was the first time in}} many years that I had cried.

500|$|Casablanca {{was part}} of the film {{colorization}} controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS. In 1984, MGM/UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, [...] " [...] {{is one of a handful}} of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to.
