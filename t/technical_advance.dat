25|$|The {{industrial}} use of mechanical meat shredding was the <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> that helped popularize the Hamburg steak. The first meat grinder {{was invented in}} the early 19th century by the German engineer Karl Drais. The machine {{made it possible for}} minced meat to be sold at market in large quantities at reasonable prices. By 1845, numerous patents existed for improved meat grinders in the United States. These machines could all shred meat to sizes before unimaginable. Before this, minced meat was prepared by hand at home using specialized chisels, intensive manual labor that severely limited the amount that could be produced. It is very likely that the invention of the meat grinder contributed directly to the popularization of Hamburg steak, while the steak gradually became distant from its German roots {{in the minds of many}} Americans. Minced meat also came to be used in other popular American foods, including hot dogs and meatloaf.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, several further mineral {{railways}} were {{constructed in the}} west of Scotland: the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, opened in 1826, proved a remarkable success in carrying coal from the collieries near Airdrie and was quickly followed by the Ballochney Railway. These [...] "coal railways" [...] used horse traction (mostly) and short cast iron rails on stone block sleepers. The key <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> was that they used [...] "edge rails": the guidance was provided by flanges on {{the wheels of the}} wagons. These lines showed the way forward.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Dark Forces was {{commonly}} called a [...] "Doom clone," [...] {{but the game}} makes significant expansions upon the gameplay features present in Doom. New gameplay mechanisms that were not common {{at the time of}} release include the ability to look up and down, duck, jump, and swim. The use of multiple floor levels is another <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> in the first-person shooter genre. To produce these new features, the developers wrote a game engine from scratch. The Jedi game engine can create gameplay and graphical elements such as fully 3D objects, atmospheric effects such as fog and haze, animated textures and shading. Stinnett indicated that the developers wanted these elements to be part of an [...] "active environment," [...] and features were included to create this: [...] "ships come and go at the flight decks, rivers sweep along, platforms and conveyor belts move and much of the machinery functions." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Vegetable Staticks Hales also {{described}} experiments {{that showed that}} [...] "… air freely enters plants, {{not only with the}} principal fund of nourishment by the roots, but also thro’ the surface of their trunks and leaves". While Hales’ work on the chemistry of air appears primitive by modern standards, its importance was acknowledged by Antoine Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen. Hales’ invention of the pneumatic trough to collect gases over water is also considered a major <b>technical</b> <b>advance.</b> Modified forms of the pneumatic trough were later used by William Brownrigg, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley in their research.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first synthetic genome by Craig Venter's group and the accompanying media coverage about [...] "life" [...] being created, President Obama requested the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to study synthetic biology. The commission convened a series of meetings, then issued a report in December 2010 titled [...] "New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technologies." [...] The commission clarified that [...] "while Venter’s achievement marked a significant <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> in demonstrating that a relatively large genome could be accurately synthesized and substituted for another, it did not amount to the “creation of life”. It also noted that synthetic biology is an emerging field, which creates potential risks and rewards. The commission did not recommend any changes to policy or oversight and called for continued funding of the research and new funding for monitoring, study of emerging ethical issues, and public education.|$|E

The stepwise approach described in this <b>technical</b> <b>advanced</b> article provides the dentist and surgeon with a basis to plan and guide the preferred implant placement in oligodontia cases.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, {{the use of}} Rξ gauges was a {{significant}} <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> in extending quantum electrodynamics computations beyond one-loop order. [...] In addition to retaining manifest Lorentz invariance, the Rξ prescription breaks the symmetry under local gauge transformations while preserving the ratio of functional measures of any two physically distinct gauge configurations. [...] This permits a change of variables in which infinitesimal perturbations along [...] "physical" [...] directions in configuration space are entirely uncoupled from those along [...] "unphysical" [...] directions, allowing the latter to be absorbed into the physically meaningless normalization of the functional integral. [...] When ξ is finite, each physical configuration (orbit {{of the group of}} gauge transformations) is represented not by a single solution of a constraint equation but by a Gaussian distribution centered on the extremum of the gauge breaking term. [...] In terms of the Feynman rules of the gauge-fixed theory, this appears as a contribution to the photon propagator for internal lines from virtual photons of unphysical polarization.|$|E

"It is {{doubtful}} whether {{the replacement of}} German agriculture on a sound basis {{in the last ten}} years is to be ascribed in a greater measure to <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> in agricultural methods, or to the development of the co-operative system. Perhaps it would be right to say that for the large farms it is due to the first, and for the smaller farms (three quarters of the arable land in Germany) to the second. For it is only through co-operation that the advantages of farming on a large scale are made possible for smaller farmers. The more important of those advantages are the regulated purchase of all raw materials and half-finished products (artificial manures, feeding stuffs, seeds, etc.), better prices for products, facilities for making use, in moderation, of personal credit at a cheap rate of interest, together with the possibility of saving and putting aside small sums of interest; all these advantages of the large farmer have been placed within the reach of the small farmers by local co-operative societies for buying, selling, and farming co-operatively, as well as by saving and other banks, all connected to central associations and central co-operative societies.|$|E

50|$|The {{population}} graph {{shows an}} increase in population up until 1840 when the population of Clifford began to decrease. The movement of people away from rural areas in the early 19th century was due to <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> and socio-economic changes leading to urban areas becoming more densely populated. The <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> meant that fewer people were needed in the agricultural industry, and this allowed people to move into towns and cities and begin {{to work for the}} labour industry.
