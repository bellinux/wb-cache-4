5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known species were {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} species were rare, and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. The species that had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 species <b>that</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E
