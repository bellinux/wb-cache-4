It is clearly impractical and insufficient for modern demands of accuracy and precision to estimate the inflection by intersection of tangents. This is done conveniently by derivatization of the <b>temperature</b> <b>curve.</b> The second derivative essentially locates the intersection of tangents to the <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> immediately pre- and post- the breakpoint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Acrylonitrile based {{copolymers}} have {{a variety}} of industrial applications and attracted the attention of material researchers with increasing interest in recent years to study their electrical properties with respect to their homopolymers. The dielectric relaxation studies as a function of temperature and frequency of the applied field reveals the information about the nature of segmental motion in polymer chain. A systematic measurement of dielectric constant (ε) and dielectric loss (tanδ) on powder pressed pellets of AN-VP copolymer in composition 50 / 50 have been carried out in the frequency range 200 Hz- 100 kHz and in the temperature range from room temperature to 180 o C, covering through the glass transition temperature Tg. Two sets of relaxation peaks on slight above room temperature and the other slightly above Tg are noticed from tanδ versus <b>temperature</b> <b>curves</b> for different frequencies. The peaks are attributed to β- and α- relaxations. Temperature coefficient of dielectric constant (TCε) is evaluated {{to understand the nature of}} the temperature dependence, AC conductivity is evaluated to understand the conduction process. Activation energy is calculated from loss (tanδ) versus <b>temperature</b> <b>curves</b> and logωp versus reciprocal <b>temperature</b> <b>curves.</b> Activation energy is also calculated from Arrehenius plots.

50|$|Next follows heat {{treatment}} of the “green brushes” under artificial atmosphere (usually hydrogen and nitrogen). Temperatures range up to 1200 °C. This process is called sintering or baking. During sintering, the binders either burn off or carbonize and form a crystalline structure between the carbon, copper and other additives. Baking is followed by graphitization ({{heat treatment}}). The heat treatment is transformed by a <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> exactly defined for each material mixture. Besides the mixture composition, the used <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> is the second big “secret” of each brush manufacturer.

50|$|The {{titration}} plot {{illustrated in}} Figure 19 {{shows that the}} endpoint is quite rounded, suggesting that the reaction might not proceed to stoichiometric equilibrium. However, since the regions of the <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> immediately {{before and after the}} endpoint are quite linear, the second derivative of this curve (representing the intersection of tangents) will accurately locate the endpoint. Indeed, excellent precision can be obtained with this titration, with a CV of less than 0.1.|$|E
5000|$|The {{temperature}} {{selected for}} the oven is that at which {{the slope of the}} crystal's frequency vs. <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> is zero, further improving stability. AT- or SC-cut (Stress-Compensated) crystals are used. The SC-cut has a wider temperature range over which near-zero temperature coefficient is achieved and thus reduces warmup time. [...] Power transistors are usually used for the heaters instead of resistance heating elements. Their power output is proportional to the current, rather than the square of the current, which linearizes the gain of the control loop.|$|E
50|$|Thermistors {{respond quickly}} to {{small changes in}} {{temperature}} such as temperature gradients in the mixed titration solution, and thus the signal can exhibit {{a small amount of}} noise. Prior to derivatization it is therefore necessary to digitally smooth (or “filter”) the <b>temperature</b> <b>curve</b> in order to obtain sharp, symmetrical second derivative “peaks” which will accurately locate the correct inflection point. This is illustrated in Figure 5. The degree of digital smoothing is optimized for each determination, and is stored as a method parameter for application every time a titration for that particular analysis is run.|$|E

This paper will provide a systematic investigation of the contact arc length in the cylindrical grinding of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. A series of single grit experiments and grinding temperature measurements, together with FEM simulation, will be utilized to determine the real contact arc length. The contact behavior between a grinding wheel and the workpiece was investigated by the contact time in the workpice surface <b>temperature</b> <b>curves.</b> It was found that in FEM simulation, the real contact length was about 2 times of the geometric length.

5000|$|In {{thermometric}} titrations, {{a constant}} addition rate of titrant equates to a constant {{amount of heat}} being given out or consumed, and hence {{a more or less}} constant temperature change up to the endpoint. In a titration, the titrant reacts with the analyte in the sample either exothermically or endothermically. The thermoprobe measures the temperature of the titrating solution. When all of the analyte in the sample has reacted with the titrant, the temperature of the solution will change, and the endpoint of the titration is revealed by an inflection in the <b>temperature</b> <b>curve.</b> 8 ...|$|E

This {{is illustrated in}} the titration plot of EDTA with calcium and magnesium in sea water (Figure 18). Following the solution <b>temperature</b> <b>curve,</b> the breakpoint for the calcium content (red-tagged endpoint) {{is followed by a}} region of modest temperature rise due to competition between the heats of dilution of the titrant with the solution, and the endothermic reaction of Mg2+ and EDTA. The breakpoint for the consumption of Mg2+ (blue-tagged endpoint) by EDTA is revealed by upswing in temperature caused purely by the heat of dilution.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether temperature scanning ultrasonic velocity measurements could be used to monitor the complex thermal transitions that occur during the crystallization and melting of triglyceride solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). Ultrasonic velocity (u) measurements were compared with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements on tripalmitin emulsions that were cooled (from 75 to 5 °C) and then heated (from 5 to 75 °C) at 0. 3 °C min− 1. There was an excellent correspondence between the thermal transitions observed in δΔu/δT versus <b>temperature</b> <b>curves</b> determined by ultrasound and heat flow versus <b>temperature</b> <b>curves</b> determined by DSC. In particular, both techniques were sensitive to the complex melting behavior of the solidified tripalmitin, which was attributed to the dependence of the melting point of the SLNs on particle size. These studies suggest that temperature scanning ultrasonic velocity measurements may prove to be a useful alternative to conventional DSC techniques for monitoring phase transitions in colloidal systems...|$|R
