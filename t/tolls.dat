5|$|As {{with the}} Burlington Bay Skyway, <b>tolls</b> were {{collected}} on the new bridge. However, the name was almost unanimously chosen by St. Catharines residents to be the Garden City Skyway. The collection of <b>tolls</b> on both skyways continued until December28, 1973.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{maintenance}} of I-84 in downstate New York was {{transferred from the}} New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA). The monies for that purpose came from <b>tolls</b> levied on I-190 in downtown Buffalo. Under the laws authorizing the Thruway construction, the <b>tolls</b> were to be removed once the original bonds {{used to pay for}} the construction were paid off, which occurred in 1996; however, the <b>tolls</b> would remain for ten more years. Attorney Carl Paladino brought a lawsuit against the state in 2006 to force the removal of the <b>tolls.</b> On October 30, 2006, the Thruway Authority voted to both begin the process of returning {{maintenance of}} I-84 to NYSDOT and to remove the <b>tolls</b> on I-190 in Buffalo. Collection of the <b>tolls</b> stopped that day. Both major candidates in the 2006 New York gubernatorial election, Democrat Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso, had pledged to remove the <b>tolls</b> on I-190 if elected. While the toll barriers in Buffalo have since been demolished, the <b>tolls</b> further north on the two Grand Island bridges still remain.|$|E

5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic <b>tolls.</b> With this, <b>tolls</b> will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for <b>tolls</b> such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic <b>tolls.</b>|$|E

Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis to concede water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the <b>tolls,</b> and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the <b>tolls</b> further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which they would give him £1,200 for one year's <b>tolls,</b> wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the <b>tolls,</b> but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more profitable for Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} morning commute {{problem with a}} peak period flat <b>toll,</b> where the <b>toll</b> has a maximum {{acceptable}} <b>toll</b> level and a maximum acceptable length of <b>tolling</b> period. Under such a constrained optimization setup, we investigate the system cost minimization problem. A <b>tolling</b> scheme {{is determined by the}} <b>toll</b> starting time, the <b>toll</b> ending time, and the <b>toll</b> level. The <b>toll</b> starting time and ending time are set before and after the common work start time, respectively. We find out that, under the <b>toll</b> window length constraint only, a balanced <b>toll</b> window design is always optimal, where “balanced” means that the part of the <b>toll</b> window before the work start time and the part after have equal monetary value. Under both the <b>toll</b> level and the <b>toll</b> window length constraints, the balanced design is optimal if feasible; otherwise the <b>toll</b> should start later with the same <b>toll</b> window length...|$|R

5|$|Initially, it was {{suggested}} that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus accrued interest was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that <b>tolls</b> would not be levied after May 1995.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. To do this, I analyze how <b>toll</b> rates change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt electronic <b>toll</b> collection. Unlike manual <b>toll</b> collection, in which the driver must hand over cash at the <b>toll</b> collection plaza, electronic <b>toll</b> collection automatically debits the <b>toll</b> amount as the car drives through the <b>toll</b> plaza, thereby plausibly decreasing the salience of the <b>toll.</b> I find robust evidence that <b>toll</b> rates increase following the adoption of electronic <b>toll</b> collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, <b>toll</b> rates are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic <b>toll</b> collection. Consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in <b>toll</b> rates, I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual <b>toll</b> declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of electronic <b>toll</b> collection. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which opened in 1827, directly affected the River Tone Navigation, as it provided a more direct route between Taunton and Bridgwater.

In order to compete with the canal, they chose to reduce the <b>tolls,</b> although they were unsure of the legality of this action while they had outstanding debts. The canal company challenged their right to reduce the <b>tolls</b> in court, but the action was defeated, and the <b>tolls</b> remained at the lower level.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the river}} was a free river, there are no figures for traffic on the lower river. However, it {{connected}} {{to a number of}} waterways on which <b>tolls</b> were collected, and so an indication of the traffic can be gained from the figures for these waterways. The main cargoes on Beverley Beck in 1730 were coal, bricks, turfs and wool, together with cereal crops, consisting of wheat, barley, oats and malt. Receipts from <b>tolls</b> more than doubled between 1732 and 1748, after which the <b>tolls</b> were let to an independent collector. The annual rent charged for this privilege doubled again between 1748 and 1792. There was a steady expansion of trade on the Driffield Navigation during the same period, as the dividends paid to shareholders rose from 1.5 to 4 per cent. In 1789, Bainton, Boyes and Co negotiated a lump sum payment to cover coal from the Aire and Calder Navigation to their new carpet factory and the export of their carpets in the downstream direction.
