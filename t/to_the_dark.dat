5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E
5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> World again from the same location using a temporary portal left behind on the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> side.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 {{declaration}} by Russia that {{it would}} stay in DST all year long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus. Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> of wintertime morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends to stay there permanently.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor first {{appeared}} in The Empire Strikes Back. He appears in hologram form to address Darth Vader, his Sith apprentice. He tells Vader that Luke Skywalker is becoming {{a serious threat to}} the Empire and must not become a Jedi.

5|$|Anakin informs Jedi Master Mace Windu of Palpatine's treachery. With {{two other}} Jedi masters at his side, Windu {{attempts}} to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at him, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's {{face into the}} gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another blast of lightning. Anakin then pledges himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> side as Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.|$|E

5|$|Katarn {{retrieves}} the Valley's {{location and}} travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors to Ruusan, the planet {{on which the}} Valley is located. Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn the choice to execute her or die. The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player's actions within the game up to this point. If Katarn has remained true to the light path he spares Ors, but if he has fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> side he kills her. With both paths, Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi's core. If the player chose the light side, the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father; if the player chose the dark path, the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> World as well.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2009, Microsoft and Epic Games {{issued a}} joint press release announcing the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, to be {{released}} on July 28, 2009. The All Fronts Collection was to be sold as a retail package, and would have included all add-ons released for Gears of War 2, a poster, and a strategy guide for the game. In response to complaints that the All Fronts Collection had identical pricing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Corners add-on, but significantly more content, {{as well as the}} All Fronts Collection retail package not being made available in certain regions, Epic Games adjusted the release plan; the All Fronts Collection was released digitally via Xbox Live and the Dark Corners add-on was reduced in price.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E

Eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, merciless revolutionary Bane forces an older Bruce Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.|$|E

5|$|The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg’s background, {{relating}} that he {{was born}} Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar’d Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts {{the attention of the}} Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary.|$|E

Zeratul disappears while Artanis takes leadership and tries to reconstruct his people's civilization.|$|E
