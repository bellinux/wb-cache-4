5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of a king was {{to act as a}} war leader, {{reflected}} in the very small number of minorities or female reigning monarchs in the period. Kings organised the defence of their people's lands, property and persons and negotiated with other kings to secure these <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> they failed to do so, the settlements might be raided, destroyed or annexed and the populations killed or taken into slavery. Kings also engaged in the low-level warfare of raiding and the more ambitious full-scale warfare that led to conflicts of large armies and alliances and which could be undertaken over relatively large distances, like the expedition to Orkney by Dál Riata in 581 or the Northumbrian attack on Ireland in 684.|$|E

25|$|In reality, {{the most}} {{significant}} hazard is driving, which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple distractions which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, prudence is key to minimizing the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from multitasking either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other <b>things</b> <b>if</b> {{he or she is}} chasing alone. Falling asleep while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the defatigating demands of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of <b>things,</b> <b>if</b> things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

On {{the lyric}} side of <b>things,</b> <b>if</b> I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side." ...|$|E

500|$|In Re Finger, Goff J made a {{distinction}} between gifts to incorporated bodies and gifts to unincorporated bodies. When a gift is to an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, {{as a gift to}} that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attained}} mixed receptions {{from television}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than [...] "Road to the North Pole" [...] of Family Guy and [...] "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls" [...] of American Dad. VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode was [...] "fairly lazy", and commented that the main plot was [...] "too much of a mob movie pastiche." [...] Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic criticized the humor of the episode, opining that [...] "for an episode with such an overdone story, we could have forgiven <b>things</b> <b>if</b> it were at least funnier." [...] He continued: [...] "Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it." [...] In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] a 2.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group are more interested in truncating <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> I was the leader as much as people say I am, every song would be 20 minutes long". The unlisted ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{publicly}} endorsed {{same sex}} marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8. The singer has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended {{a rally in}} 2013 {{in response to the}} acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for [...] "Freedom". In a 2016 interview with Elle, she responded to the controversy surrounding her song [...] "Formation" [...] which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, [...] "I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me".|$|E
500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race. During a February 18 taping of Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a Philadelphia-area local news show, host Larry Kane asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, [...] "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it. In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer <b>things</b> <b>if</b> I got out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those <b>things</b> <b>if</b> you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and <b>things</b> <b>if</b> it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|During a {{rally in}} Allahabad, Gandhi said [...] "Poverty is just a state of mind. It {{does not mean the}} {{scarcity}} of food, money or material <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> one possesses self-confidence, then one can overcome poverty." [...] The phrase [...] "state of mind" [...] drew sharp criticism with BJP Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak alleging him to be mocking the poor. Oneindia News wrote that he made [...] "economics irrelevant".|$|E
2500|$|I don't think whole {{populations are}} villainous, but Americans are just {{extraordinarily}} unaware {{of all kinds}} of <b>things.</b> <b>If</b> you live {{in the middle of that}} vast continent, with apparently everything your heart could wish for just because you were born there, then why worry? [...] If people lose knowledge, sympathy and understanding of the natural world, they're going to mistreat it and will not ask their politicians to care for it.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Burke was a theorist of the sublime, and he {{regarded}} Milton's description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an aesthetic concept. For Burke, {{it was to}} set alongside mountain-tops, a storm at sea, and infinity. In The Beautiful and the Sublime, he wrote: [...] "No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible <b>things,</b> <b>if</b> I may use the expression, in their strongest light, {{by the force of}} a judicious obscurity than Milton." ...|$|E
