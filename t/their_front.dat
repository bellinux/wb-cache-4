5|$|In 1843, {{another group}} of planned Greek Revival townhouses was built at 160-168 Second Street. Unusual for urban houses, they {{featured}} one-and-a-half-story porticos on <b>their</b> <b>front</b> facades, with Ionic columns, and (originally) side yards. Another house was built at 170, several years later, in a similar style. They were widely imitated elsewhere in the city.|$|E
5|$|Riders have experimented, however. After the Second World War many tried wooden rims of {{the sort}} used {{at the start of}} cycle racing. Francesco Moser wrapped his {{handlebars}} with strips of foam in the 1970s. Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and Greg LeMond experimented with suspension in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> forks in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|A local {{department}} store announces {{the formation of}} a new August holiday called Love Day intended to boost sales. The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the garbage to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails {{to make it to the}} curb in time. As the garbage men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on <b>their</b> <b>front</b> lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E

50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>fronts</b> have widths of over 3 km {{in average}} and their terminuses {{are in the}} Kara Sea between Cape Opasnyy and Cape Middendorff.|$|R
2500|$|A pair of 18th-century gate piers at the {{entrance}} of the churchyard are listed GradeII. [...] On <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> are carvings of skull and crossbones.|$|R
5|$|After he retired, Sakic {{decided to}} take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic {{returned}} to the Avalanche to work in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> office. He was named an executive advisor and alternate governor for the team, effective {{at the end of the}} 2010â€“11 season. In his role as an advisor, Sakic would advise the team in hockey-related matters, and as an alternate governor, would represent the team at Board of Governors meetings.|$|E
5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using <b>their</b> <b>front</b> legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on <b>their</b> <b>front</b> pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes {{for the first few}} days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E
50|$|Adriaan Fokker's 1951 31-tone organ used {{relatively}} short rectangular keys with sides relieved toward <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> to form T-shaped playing surfaces, {{as well as}} longer rectangular keys in a concave arrangement for a pedalboard.|$|R
5000|$|In the 198 BC Rosetta Stone of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, the harpoon hieroglyph is {{used only}} once, in line 8: [...] "crowns, 10...with uraeus on <b>their</b> <b>fronts,</b> on one every among them." [...] - ("on each among them").|$|R
25|$|In the 1920s {{the evening}} trams from Whitefield and Manchester had a {{letterbox}} fitted to <b>their</b> <b>fronts,</b> enabling letters to be posted at the tram stops {{in time to}} reach the last post collection at Manchester post sorting office.|$|R
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, <b>their</b> <b>front</b> limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been forced to surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Despite several counterattacks {{during the}} afternoon, the New Zealanders {{managed to hold}} <b>their</b> <b>front</b> line, {{including}} the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due {{to the failure of}} 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division's sector.|$|E
60|$|Miles {{and those}} around him, however, had {{not to turn}} out. Owing to their {{position}} {{on the roof of}} the Sphinx Redoubt, they had only to roll on <b>their</b> <b>fronts,</b> rest <b>their</b> rifles on the sandbags, and they were at once ready for action.|$|R
25|$|Housed in the Regional Resource Centre, the Open Store is {{accessible}} to visitors. Objects are housed on racks along one wall, while {{the bulk of}} items are in a rolling archive, with one set of shelves opened, with perspex across <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> to permit viewing without touching.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are similar}} to Notonecta glauca, the water boatman or back swimmer by appearance, {{although}} these lesser waterboatman are herbivores and swim on <b>their</b> <b>fronts.</b> They {{are not related to}} Notonecta glauca, the water boatman or back swimmer, nor to the European Micronecta scholtzi, also known as the [...] "lesser water boatman".|$|R
5|$|In 1948, Krichell was {{involved}} in a minor scandal. Harry Nicolas was a high school baseball star in Long Island. The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with a blank check, being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas never reached the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> office hiring him.|$|E
5|$|Marsh rice rats from Paynes Prairie, Alachua County; Cedar Key, Levy County; and Lake Istokpoga, Highlands County, all in Florida, {{have yielded}} A.forresteri. In Paynes Prairie, the type locality, 82 of 178 animals {{examined}} were infected with 1 to 50 (average 10) worms, but in Cedar Key {{only a single}} rat contained one worm. The worms {{were found in the}} front part, or fundus, of the stomach, with <b>their</b> <b>front</b> ends in the fundal tissue and their back ends projecting into the inside.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along <b>their</b> <b>front</b> to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, all {{carriages}} were refurbished {{as part of}} the CityDecker program. This saw {{the interiors}} refurbished with white walls and ceilings, grey floors and blue seats. Power cars received a destination indicator and had yellow applied to the lower half of <b>their</b> <b>fronts.</b> Sliding Beclawat windows were replaced with hopper windows and doors painted yellow.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{construction}} of the Sepulveda Tunnel, showing two Ransome [...] half-yard concrete guns, March 1, 1930. The two concrete guns sit side by side at center with their long, metal pipes extending into the foreground. Gauges are attached to <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> and a single light bulb hangs overhead. They area is contained by a small, wooden structure...|$|R
50|$|The Camiguin hanging parrot {{is mostly}} green with blue throat, face and thighs, {{and a red}} tail and red crown. Males and female birds look identical, which is unusual for a hanging parrot native to the Philippines. Only the males {{of all the other}} populations living on other islands have a red area on <b>their</b> <b>fronts.</b>|$|R
5|$|One {{isolated}} Covenanter brigade {{that stood}} its ground {{was at the}} right of <b>their</b> <b>front</b> line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them. In the third charge, Lucas's horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line. Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E
5|$|Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is {{the real}} {{cul-de-sac}} that doubles for Ramsay Street. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> and back yards and on occasions, in their garages. Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with tourists. Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill, the adjoining suburb in which Pin Oak Court is located.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on <b>their</b> <b>front</b> paws to defend themselves. A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E
50|$|In {{the grounds}} are a moat, a {{fishpond}}, kitchen garden and formal lawns. The moated {{site and the}} fishpond are designated as a scheduled monument. The two lodges at entrances to the drives are listed at Grade II. Both are constructed in brick with stone dressings and slate hipped roofs. <b>Their</b> <b>fronts</b> are symmetrical, with Tuscan porches, and 12-pane sash windows.|$|R
50|$|They {{are mainly}} green with areas of red, orange, yellow, and blue varying between subspecies. Only the males have a red area on <b>their</b> <b>fronts,</b> {{except for the}} {{population}} living on Camiguin, where neither male nor female have this red area. They make nests in tree holes and, unusually for a parrot, the female takes nesting material back to the nest.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of stone}} Gods on display from prehistoric pueblo ruins near Santa Fe, New Mexico, ca. 1895. At center, {{thirteen}} oblong stones with vaguely anthropomorphic carving {{on their faces}} are arranged in three tiers. The two largest stones, positoned {{on the floor and}} at the top, appear to have legs and arms carved on <b>their</b> <b>fronts.</b> In the background, more stones appear to be stored in cubbies. Photoprint reads: "Cliff dwellers"...|$|R
5|$|Protesters {{continued}} {{to delay the}} destruction of the tree. Solicitors for the campaign had even argued in court that receipt of a letter addressed to the tree itself gave it the status of a legal dwelling, causing a further delay,. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures of the tree on <b>their</b> <b>front</b> pages.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking <b>their</b> <b>front</b> paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in <b>their</b> <b>front</b> windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class â€“ city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Carleton Emery, one of Holy Apostles' charter members, made {{stained glass}} windows {{for the church to}} replace those that St. Andrew's had kept. In 1985 Holy Apostles {{achieved}} full parish status in the new Episcopal Diocese of Central Florida. Unlike many other Carpenter Gothic churches which feature large rose windows high on <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> or backs, Holy Apostles has only a small pin-hole window high on its front.|$|R
50|$|Only in December 1854, Johann Baptist Beha, {{the best}} known maker of cuckoo clocks of his time, sold two of them, with oil {{paintings}} on <b>their</b> <b>fronts,</b> to the Furtwangen clock dealer Gordian Hettich, which were described as BahnhÃ¶fle Uhren ("Railroad station clocks"). More than a year later, on January 20, 1856, another respected Furtwangen-based cuckoo clockmaker, Theodor Ketterer, sold one to Joseph Ruff in Glasgow (Scotland, United Kingdom).|$|R
6000|$|Around {{the edge}} of the {{clearing}} were wooden barns and stables with <b>their</b> <b>fronts</b> wide open, showing stalls and mangers and stabling for all kinds of toy animals. One had a sign over the door reading [...] "Fire Engine," [...] and another [...] "Police Patrol." [...] The stables were all about as high as Dot's waist, and in some of them were toy animals and stablemen, while others were entirely empty.|$|R
