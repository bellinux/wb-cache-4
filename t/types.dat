5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and <b>types</b> of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call <b>types</b> decrease and subset call <b>types</b> increase. The use of both call <b>types</b> is called biphonation. The increased subset call <b>types</b> may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We define <b>type</b> A, <b>type</b> B, <b>type</b> C {{as well as}} C∗-semi-finite C∗-algebras. It {{is shown}} that a von Neumann algebra is a <b>type</b> A, <b>type</b> B, <b>type</b> C or C∗-semi-finite C∗-algebra {{if and only if}} it is, respectively, a <b>type</b> I, <b>type</b> II, <b>type</b> III or semi-finite von Neumann algebra. Moreover, any <b>type</b> I C∗-algebra is of <b>type</b> A (actually, <b>type</b> A coincides with the discreteness as defined by Peligrad and Zsidó), and any <b>type</b> II C∗-algebra (as defined by Cuntz and Pedersen) is of <b>type</b> B. Moreover, any <b>type</b> C C∗-algebra is of <b>type</b> III (in the sense of Cuntz and Pedersen), any purely {{infinite}} C∗-algebra (in the sense of Kirchberg and Rørdam) with real rank zero is of <b>type</b> C, and any separable purely infinite C∗-algebra with stable rank one is also of <b>type</b> C. We also prove that <b>type</b> A, <b>type</b> B, <b>type</b> C and C∗-semi-finiteness are stable under hereditary C∗-subalgebras, multiplier algebras and strong Morita equivalence. Further-more, any C∗-algebra A contains a largest <b>type</b> A closed ideal JA, a largest typeB closed ideal JB, a largest <b>type</b> C closed ideal JC as well as a largest C∗-semi-finite closed ideal Jsf. Among them, we have JA + JB being an essential ideal of Jsf, and JA + JB + JC being an essential ideal of A. On the other hand, A/JC is always C∗-semi-finite, and if A is C∗-semi-finite, then A/JB is of <b>type</b> A. Finally, we show that these results hold if <b>type</b> A, <b>type</b> B, <b>type</b> C and C∗-semi-finiteness are replaced by discreteness, <b>type</b> II, <b>type</b> III and semi-finiteness (as defined by Cuntz and Pedersen), respectively. 1...|$|R
