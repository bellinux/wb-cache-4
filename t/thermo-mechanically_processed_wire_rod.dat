40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of equal channel angular pressing-Conform (ECAP-C) and further {{artificial}} aging (AA) on microstructure, mechanical, and electrical properties of Al 6101 alloy. As is shown, ECAP-C at 130 °C with six cycles resulted {{in the formation of}} an ultrafine-grained (UFG) structure with a grain size of 400 – 600 nm containing nanoscale spherical metastable β′ and stable β second-phase precipitates. As a result, <b>processed</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> demonstrated the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 308 MPa and electrical conductivity of 53. 1 % IACS. Electrical conductivity can be increased without any notable degradation in mechanical strength of the UFG alloy by further AA at 170 °C and considerably enhanced by additional decomposition of solid solution accompanied by the formation of rod-shaped metastable β′ precipitates mainly in the ultrafine grain interior and by the decrease of the alloying element content in the Al matrix. It is demonstrated that ECAP-C can be used to <b>process</b> Al-Mg-Si <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> with the specified UFG microstructure. The mechanical strength and electrical conductivity in this case are shown to be much higher than those in the industrial semi-finished products made of similar material processed by the conventional T 6 or T 81 treatment...|$|R

40|$|Very often defects {{are present}} in rolled products. For <b>wire</b> <b>rods,</b> defects are very {{deleterious}} since the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> are generally used directly in various applications. For this reason, the market nowadays requires <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> to be completely defect-free. Any wire with defects must be rejected as scrap which is very costly for the production mill. Thus, {{it is very important}} to study the formation and evolution of defects during <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling in order to better understand and minimize the problem, at the same time improving quality of the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> and reducing production costs. The present work is focused on the evolution of artificial defects during rolling. Longitudinal surface defects are studied during shape rolling of an AISI M 2 high speed steel and a longitudinal central inner defect is studied in an AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel during ultra-high-speed <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling. Experimental studies are carried out by rolling short rods prepared with arteficial defects. The evolution of the defects is characterised and compared to numerical analyses.

40|$|AbstractDual Phase steels (DP) {{are part}} of the Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) family and consist in a {{ferritic}} matrix with a fraction of dispersed martensite between 5 and 50 %, which gives the material a good combination of strength and ductility, with a significant capacity to absorb energy. Steel wires called in Argentina ATR 500 N, are used to manufacture steel welded framework, wires mesh and lattice girders for reinforcement of concrete structures and their mechanical requirements have defined in this country by the IRAM-IAS U 500 526 standard. The current manufacturing <b>process</b> uses a <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> of low carbon steel, hardened by cold working, producing a low ductility and low yield strength to tensile strength ratio product, although meet the requirements of the standard. The objective of the present work is to develop DP steels for ATR 500 N product, starting from the raw material used today and compare their mechanical properties to the commercial product. Several grades of DP steels were obtained and characterized microstructural and mechanically. Expressions of technological interest were developed, relating properties with fraction of martensite. Certain DP steels were slightly hardened by cold working and compared with the commercial ATR 500 N product. The DP steels developed fully satisfy the requirements of the standard and, in addition, a significantly higher elongation, hardening exponent and yield strength to tensile strength ratio. These characteristics are interesting for earth-quake resistant applications. A new manufacturing route could be developed for ATR 500 N product...|$|R
