2500|$|The Independent {{reported}} in 2015 that {{the usage of}} Yazidi sex slaves had created ongoing friction among fighters within ISIL. Sajad Jiyad, a Research Fellow and Associate Member at the Iraqi Institute for Economic Reform, told the newspaper that many ISIL supporters and fighters had been in denial about the trafficking of kidnapped Yazidi women until a Dabiq article justifying the practice was published. The New York Times said in August 2015 that [...] "he systematic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State {{in the year since}} the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution." [...] The article claims that ISIL is not merely exonerating but sacralising rape, and illustrated this with the testimony of escapees. One 15-year-old victim said that, while she was being assaulted, her rapist [...] "kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> is ibadah"; a 12-year-old victim related how her assailant claimed that, [...] "by raping me, he is drawing closer to God"; and one adult prisoner told how, when she challenged her captor about repeatedly raping a 12 year old, she was met with the retort, [...] "No, she's not a little girl, she's a slave and she knows exactly how to have sex and having sex with her pleases God." ...|$|E
