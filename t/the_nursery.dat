5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. <b>The</b> <b>nursery</b> and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to demonstrate an effect of manual feeding on the level of farmer’s exposure to airborne contaminants in <b>the</b> confinement <b>nursery</b> pig house. <b>The</b> levels of all the airborne contaminants besides respirable dust, total airborne fungi and ammonia were significantly higher in <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house with feeding than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house without feeding. Although there is no significant difference in respirable dust and total airborne fungi between the treatment and the control, their concentrations in <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house were also higher than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house. <b>The</b> result that the level of ammonia in <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house is lower than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house would be reasoned by the mechanism of ammonia generation in the pig house and adsorption property of ammonia to dust particles. In conclusion, manual feeding by farmer increased the exposure level of airborne contaminants compared to no feeding activity...|$|R

5|$|When Victoria's first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, {{was born}} on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the {{arrangements}} for <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> staff. Lehzen put <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> {{in the hands of}} a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel. In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and be it on her head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted to rise above her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tolkien was {{pursuing}} an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems {{had been published}} in magazines and small collections, including Goblin Feet and , a reworking of <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, {{which he had been}} creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E
40|$|The {{bays and}} {{estuaries}} {{of the southeast}} United States coast generally are thought to serve as nursery areas for various species of coastal sharks, where juvenile sharks find abundant food and are less exposed to predation by larger sharks.
