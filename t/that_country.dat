40|$|Using {{data for}} 38 countries, I {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} slave trades on individual components of GDP. I observe three important pieces of evidence <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> greatly affected by slave exports are less developed today. Firstly, I find <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> with more slave exports spend a smaller share of GDP on government purchases. This {{finding is consistent with}} Wagner’s law in <b>that</b> more developed <b>countries</b> tend to allocate a larger share of GDP on government expenditure. I also find weak evidence <b>that</b> these <b>countries</b> spend less on health and education which implies low investment in human capital in these countries. Secondly, I find <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> exported more slaves are more dependent on agriculture. These countries have not experienced structural transformation to the same extent as developed countries. Finally, I find no evidence <b>that</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> exported more slaves are more dependent on aid...|$|R
