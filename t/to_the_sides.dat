5|$|Subsidiary chapels, {{dedicated}} to deities {{associated with the}} primary god, lay <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the main one. When the main temple god was male, the secondary chapels were often {{dedicated to}} that god's mythological consort and child. The secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship.|$|E

50|$|The rachidian tooth has {{two long}} main cusps {{and might have}} a {{denticle}} between them, with one to two cusps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> left main cusp and one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> right one. The lateral teeth are tricuspid, with the mesocone largest and two to five minor cusps <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> endocone and the ectocone. The marginal teeth have up to ten cusps.|$|R
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because {{of the danger of}} exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador's {{traditional}} first kit colour is {{blue with}} white trim, their second kit being white with blue trim. The current {{home and away}} kit features the traditional colours {{with the exception of}} bold curved trims that run {{from the center of the}} neck and open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> forming two panels on the chest that contain the Umbro logo and emblem of the Salvadoran Football Federation. At the center of the kit the Salvadoran national emblem, once again, is shown. The right sleeve shows the national flag.|$|E
50|$|Inactive {{patients}} must {{be turned}} every two hours, {{which is the}} minimum time that a bed sore can develop. To move a bedridden patient <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> patient is first pulled closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>side</b> that they are turning to give room <b>to</b> maneuver. When <b>the</b> patient is turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> a pillow is usually placed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back <b>to</b> support that position.|$|R

This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.|$|E
5|$|Stela 63 was {{dedicated}} by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts {{and it is}} possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 {{season as}} usual. The {{illuminated}} tableaux {{had been removed}} during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the trains rather than being self illuminated. The line {{was not included in}} the 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism, and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway.|$|E

5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> {{of a ship}} {{so as to make}} its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull. The prototype was developed to include automatic control of brightness using a photocell. The prototyped concept was never put into production, though the Canadian prototypes did briefly see active service. The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|E
5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin and serve as nucleation sites for new actin filaments. The complex binds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of existing ("mother") filaments and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of}} this nucleation of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the fighter, the {{error in the}} horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side}} of the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray has a thin, oval {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout {{has a wide}} base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to four small <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides)</b> on the floor. The small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.|$|E
