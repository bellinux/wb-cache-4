40|$|Purpose In recent years, a new {{perspective}} for food packaging {{has emerged as a}} result of several issues like quality, safety, competitive prices or providing of useful information to consumers. This {{new perspective}} is called communicative packaging. Communicative packaging may influence consumers/companies on purchasing decisions. Since the environmental evaluation of such systems has not yet been performed, this paper is focused on the environmental evaluation of a flexible best-before-date (FBBD) communicative device on a packaging consumer unit and its implications on reducing environmental impacts related to fresh products. This consumer unit consists of a nanoclay-based polylactic acid tray filled with pork chops. Methods The environmental assessment of <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> was made through life cycle assessment (LCA) using a cradle-to-gate approach. Environmental impacts were assessed according to the Eco-Indicator 99 v 2. 1 methodology in Individualist (I) perspective. Results and discussion Several results were obtained from the LCA. With regard to environmental impacts of the FBBD, most of them were due to the paper substrate used for the manufacture of this communicative packaging concept {{as well as to the}} transports for delivering the components of the FBBD communicative device. On the other hand, when environmental impacts of packaging system with and without FBBD were compared, a large environmental load was detected for the system that has the communicative device affixed as a result of the higher weight of the package. However, the environmental load caused by the use of the FBBD was minimal in comparison with the total environmental load of the whole packaging system. On the contrary, <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> that has the communicative device affixed showed less environmental burden than <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> that has not affixed the device. This was due to the environmental benefits that the communicative device provides by reducing the amount of out-of-date packaged products at retailer outlets. Conclusions The use of a FBBD contributes to minimize environmental burdens related to the production, packaging and delivery of pork chops since it facilitates a dynamic control of out-of-date products even though <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> with FBBD weighs 1 g more than <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> that does not use the communicative device. Recommendations The results presented in this paper are estimated results of a specific case study for a prototype of communicative packaging device. Consequently, these results must be considered as a first approach according to future developments on communicative packaging...|$|E

With the release of calendar year 2012 CE data on September 10, 2013, the education of reference person classification {{was replaced by the}} highest education level of any member in <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit.</b> The major reason for this change is that the highest {{level of education}} attained by any household member more accurately reflects income and spending patterns than does the education level of the reference person only. For example, data from the Census Bureau show that the proportion of married couples where the wife is the more educated spouse increased during the 1996 – 2010 period. This means that the education level in families where the husband is designated as the reference person could be understated.

The plant was fed {{with a mixture of}} livestock manure and renewable energy crops and was operated under mesophilic conditions. This paper will provide an insight into precise electric energy consumption measurements of a full scale biogas plant over a period of two years. The results showed that a percentage of 8. 5 % (in 2010) and 8. 7 % (in 2011) of the produced electric energy was consumed by the combined heat and power unit (CHP), which was required to operate the biogas plant. <b>The</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> agitators with 4. 3 % (in 2010) and 4. 0 % (in 2011) and CHP unit with 2. 5 % (in 2010 and 2011) accounted for the highest electrical power demand, in relation to the electric energy produced by the CHP unit. Calculations show that 51 % (in 2010) and 46 % (in 2011) of the total electric energy demand was due to the agitators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey (CEDS) is to obtain data on small, {{frequently}} occurring expenditures {{that would be very}} difficult for respondents to recall and report in the quarterly interview. Each consumer unit keeps a detailed record of expenses in the diary for two 1 -week reporting periods. Usually one person assumes responsibility for collecting and recording expenditures from all other CU members. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is interested in testing the feasibility of distributing diaries to every member of <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> (CU) who is at least 14 years old. One person in each CU would be designated as the main shopper and be responsible for recording CU expenses. The other diarykeepers would report their own expenses. This study had two goals: 1. Assess how a multiple diary procedure works in a field setting 2. Compare two different procedures for picking up the diaries from the CU. To address these goals, a field survey was conducted that asked CUs to keep a diary for a oneweek period. All persons in each CU, age 14 and older, were asked to record their expenses in their own diary. For half of the CUs, the field interviewer asked one person to collect the diaries {{at the end of the}} week. The field interviewer collected the diaries and interviewed this person. Fo...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{climate change}} and fast {{depleting}} stock of fossil fuel, electrification of transport systems, both rail and road, has been promoted by many governments around the world. The resultant changes in the load demand in the transmission and distribution electricity networks, along with other motivations such as integrating distributed generation from renewable sources, improving energy efficiency through demand response (DR) and managing increasingly aged infrastructure, {{have led to the}} paradigm of Smart Grid being proposed as the next generation of the power grid. Electric vehicle (EV) as a load type requiring power for rechargi~g has a significant I impact on power systems, e. g. increases of peak demand, voltage drop, powerlosses and harmonic distortion, decrease of load factor, transformer overload and feeder congestion. The work presented in this thesis studies the aspect ofDR in Smart Grid which could help mitigate the impact of EV s on power demand and exploit the ability to manage EV s charging times for improving power system performance, i. e. flattening the system load profile. It aims to address the following issues: modelling and monitoring EV charging profiles to obtain load information; and developing a DR model for optimising power systems demand due to EV charging. Through comprehensive research, a model of the EV charging load is obtained by statistical analysis. A non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) system, capable of monitoring and identifying the presence of traditional appliance and the EV charging loads through measurements at a single point in a household, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>unit</b> has been developed. In the light of the outcomes of the load research, two novel DR programs based on multiple time-of-use (TOU) tariffs and real-time prices with penalties (RTPP) respectively are proposed to manage EV charging for the optimisation of power systems demand. Example studies are carried out to validate and evaluate the DR programs. Results show that the programs can help flatten the system load profile and the fluctuations in the profile decrease gradually with increasing penetration levels of EV s. Furthermore, by levelling off load requirements, the programs could allow generation companies to operate their plant more efficiently, reduce degradation of power plant due to inefficient operation, help to reduce utility costs, and hence reduce customer bills. I. The developed load model, NILM system and DR model in this thesis provide much improved tools in EV charging load prediction and management for power system planning and optimal operations, because the stochastic behaviour of the EV charging load and diversities among EV s that have not been considered in previous researches are carefully studied. The proposed DR programs give a valuable insight into strategies for the design and implementation of DR in the future Smart Grid, resulting in possible congestion due to concurrent responses be avoided.
