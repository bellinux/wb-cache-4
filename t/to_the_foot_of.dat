5|$|The bishops {{continued}} to use the title Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury until finally renouncing their claim to Glastonbury in 1219. Services in the reconsecrated Great Church had begun on Christmas Day, 1213, most likely before it was entirely completed. King Edward I and Queen Eleanor attended the magnificent service at the reburial of King Arthur's remains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the High Altar in 1278.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} pieces of what would later become part of US23's freeway route was {{completed}} in late 1951 or early 1952, when a two-lane bypass was built around {{the eastern side of}} Milan. Two years later, a similar bypass was built from Bridgeport to M-81 {{on the east side of}} Saginaw, with the old route becoming a Bus. US23 designation. Both bypasses would later be upgraded to four-lane freeways by 1961, with the Saginaw one later incorporated into the route of I-75. When the Mackinac Bridge opened on November 1, 1957, US23, US27 and US31 were extended along the access roadways <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge.

In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, {{making it more difficult}} to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E

5|$|The route {{initially}} heads {{east from}} Watkins Glen to skirt {{the southern edge}} of the lake, but turns north upon exiting the village and passing the southeastern tip of the waterbody. Just outside Watkins Glen, NY414 comes to a fork. The left fork carries NY414 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the valley, bringing it very close to Seneca Lake. The right fork holds NY79, which travels {{up the side of the}} valley toward the village of Burdett. NY414 continues to parallel Seneca Lake, but gradually ascends the side of the lake valley as it heads north through the town of Hector and enters Seneca County.|$|E
5|$|Harlech Castle rests {{upon the}} spur of rock called the Harlech Dome; the land falls away sharply on the north and west, and a ditch cut into the rock protects the {{remaining}} approaches to the castle. The castle has a concentric design, with one line of defences enclosed by another, forming an inner and outer ward; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today. Harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone, with large, regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material, possibly taken from the ditch, used for the walls. The main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the cliffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up the hill to a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E

5|$|The 179th Street station (drawn up as 178th Street) {{had been}} planned {{along with the rest}} of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as its {{original}} terminus as early as 1928. In December 1930, however, it was planned to construct stations only up to 169th Street, with tail tracks and switches installed up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the station at 178th Street, along with a provision for the station. The tracks ended at bumper blocks, and the tunnel at a bulkhead. Under these plans, the 178th Street station would be built during a further eastward extension. The Queens Boulevard Line was extended up to 169th Street on April 24, 1937, with the tail tracks and switches used to store and reverse trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{railway used}} steam {{locomotives}} from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from Fletcher, Jennings & Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria, {{and both are}} still in service, 150years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge {{is thought to have}} been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway, and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No.1 Talyllyn is an 0-4-2ST (saddle tank) and No.2 Dolgoch is an 0-4-0WT (well tank). The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.|$|E
5|$|When Colorado state troops {{arrived in}} Cripple Creek {{early on the}} morning of June 6, more {{violence}} had already broken out. The deputies were exchanging gunfire with the miners on Bull Hill. Gen. Brooks quickly moved his troops from the train station <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> Bull Hill. As Sheriff Bowers and Gen. Brooks began to argue about what course of action to take next, the deputies took advantage of the lull and attempted to charge the miners. The miners sounded the whistle at the Victor mine, alerting Gen. Brooks. Soldiers of the state militia quickly intercepted the deputies and stopped their advance. Brooks ordered his men to occupy the top of Bull Hill, and the miners offered no resistance.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the battle}} of Pearl Ridge, the Australians {{launched}} a full-scale offensive to counter the Japanese resistance on the island, focused on the southern sector. As {{a result of this}} decision, the 7th Brigade was moved from the central sector to the southern sector, where the majority of the Japanese forces were located. They would subsequently see heavy fighting around Slater's Knoll in March and April 1945. The 11th Brigade, under Brigadier John Stevenson, then took control of both the central and northern sectors in order to free up troops for the main offensive in the south, and the brigade subsequently cycled its three infantry battalions through the position, while pursuing a limited advance in the north, attacking Tsimba Ridge in January– February 1945 after advancing along the coast from Kuraio Mission. The brigade maintained a battalion-group element on Pearl Ridge during this phase and carried out extensive patrols forward of the position, while artillery from the 4th Field Regiment was brought up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> the Laruma escarpment from where they could fire on Japanese positions under the control of forward observers on Pearl Ridge. Initially, this artillery consisted of a battery of short 25 pounders, but it was later replaced by the longer-range long 25 pounders.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> {{a small hill}} on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by {{the remainder of the}} defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view {{at the end of the}} ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E
