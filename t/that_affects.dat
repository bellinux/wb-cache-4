Geriatrics is the specific medical branch of illnesses <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> the aging. Gerontology is the study of factors <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> aging and the effects of aging on a person. Gerontological Nurses need to know about both how to care for illnesses <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> the aging, what other factors affect aging, and how they impact people.|$|R

5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean <b>that</b> <b>affects</b> the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E

Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E

The Thunder Raven emits a thunder blast <b>that</b> <b>affects</b> enemies across the screen, and the Ball O' Fire burns enemies on contact.

In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E
