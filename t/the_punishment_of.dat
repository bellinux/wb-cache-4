5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger posits that Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's {{grappling with the}} desire for revenge and the tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced the rape of Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's rape of an Aryan woman, thus completely inverting Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing <b>the</b> <b>Punishment</b> <b>of</b> the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece {{the only}} {{disturbance}} to Macedonian rule was the {{attempt by the}} Spartan king Agis III to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against the Macedonians. However, he was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Although the governor of Thrace, Memnon, had threatened to rebel, it appears that Antipater dissuaded him with diplomacy before campaigning against Agis III in the Peloponnese. Antipater deferred <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330 BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom restored (despite the possibility that the Macedonian king most likely had Antipater install them in the first place).|$|E

40|$|Compliance with {{laws and}} {{regulations}} depends on the expected penalty facing violators. The expected penalty depends on both <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>punishment</b> and <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> if caught.

5|$|On March 18, 1653, the {{mediating}} Catholic central Swiss cantons {{proposed in}} Lucerne {{a resolution that}} fulfilled most of the peasants' demands, especially the fiscal ones. In Bern, a similar compromise was proposed by a Protestant delegation from Zürich {{under the direction of}} the mayor of Zürich, Johann Heinrich Waser, on April 4, 1653. The Bernese Emmental and most of the districts of the canton of Lucerne accepted these resolutions and their representatives swore new oaths of fealty. But the people in the Entlebuch valley did not accept the authorities' terms, as these—besides offering some tax reliefs—criminalized the insurrection and called for <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> the leaders. At a meeting at Signau on April 10, 1653, the delegates from the Entlebuch convinced their neighbours in the Emmental: the assembly decided not to honor the new oaths its representatives had sworn in Bern.|$|E
5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, and stocks and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their ears were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose <b>the</b> <b>punishment</b> <b>of</b> exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
