40|$|We {{report the}} surface {{activated}} bonding (SAB) through Au thin films with {{the thickness of}} a few tens of nanometers {{can be applied to}} room temperature vacuum sealing for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging. In previous study, it was found that room temperature bonding of Si/Si and Si/chemical mechanical polished (CMP) electroplated Cu could be successfully applied to vacuum sealing of micro cavities. However this method needs high vacuum in bonding process for keeping activated surfaces and the surfaces should be cleaned by wet processes. In this study we attempt to realize room temperature vacuum sealing in low vacuum without any wet surface pre-treatments utilizing Au thin films with controlled surface roughness. We propose and develop packaging structures with comb-drive resonators for characterization of sealing quality and show the applicability of SAB of Au-Au thin films <b>to</b> <b>vacuum-seal</b> packaging...|$|E

The Department of Trade and Industry have recently published a report highlighting the problems of opening foodstuff packaging. The aim of this pilot study was to observe and document the different techniques used by a range {{of male and female}} subjects as they tried to open one of the packaging types highlighted in the report as difficult <b>to</b> open, a <b>vacuum-sealed</b> fruit jam jar. Three types of fruit jam jars were assessed with four subjects, two males and two females. Each subject was physically characterised. During the task performance upper limb posture and the forces applied through the jam jar were recorded using a video camera, a CODA motion capture system and a universal grip dynamometer (UGD). The relationship between the physical characteristics and task performance will be discussed in relation to vacuum jar packaging design, and the appropriateness of the assessment methods used...|$|R
40|$|Although {{iron pyrite}} had been {{identified}} as a novel photo-voltaic material, it is yet to be harnessed. Iron pyrite forms mechanically unstable films with pinholes. A simple method has been devised to greatly improve the mechanical stability of iron pyrite thin films grown on quartz. This is done by annealing the precursor films prior <b>to</b> sulfurizing in <b>vacuum-sealed</b> quartz tubes. It has also been shown that an equilibrium based process is necessary to synthesize films of good quality. Zinc was successfully incorporated into iron pyrite thin films to increase the bandgap by 0. 1 eV. The electronic properties of these films are similar to that found in literature. It has been identified that cracks in the film and voids between the grains are the cause for poor electronic properties. Composition analysis showed a high degree of oxygen contamination in iron precursor films resulting in poor electronic properties of iron pyrite films obtained by sulfuring the precursor films. Thus {{it may be possible to}} synthesize high quality films if these issues are addressed. ...|$|R
