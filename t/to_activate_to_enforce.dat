40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of adaptive numerical schemes for steady transport equations is addressed. A goal-oriented error estimator is presented {{and used as}} a refinement criterion for conforming mesh adaptation. The error {{in the value of}} a linear target functional is measured in terms of weighted residuals that depend on the solutions to the primal and dual problems. The Galerkin orthogonality error is taken into account and found to be important whenever flux or slope limiters are <b>activated</b> <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> monotonicity constraints. The localization of global errors is performed using a natural decomposition of the involved weights into nodal contributions. A nodal generation function is employed in a hierarchical mesh adaptation procedure which makes each refinement step readily reversible. The developed simulation tools are applied to a linear convection problem in two space dimensions...|$|R

This activation spreads through the node's links, {{making it easier}} <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> nodes <b>to</b> which the <b>activated</b> node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> <b>to</b> an extent proportional {{to the strength of}} the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also <b>activate.</b> Thus, being connected <b>to</b> an <b>activated</b> node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as [...] "priming." ...|$|R
