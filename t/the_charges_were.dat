5|$|He {{was arrested}} in 2002 for interfering with police {{investigating}} a code violation at a restaurant he owned; <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> eventually dropped. After settling down in Newport Beach, California, the police appeared over 70 times at his home because of loud parties.

5|$|In March 1975 Massino {{was arrested}} {{at the scene of}} the arrest of one of his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with {{conspiracy}} to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped after he successfully argued that he had not been properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> reduced in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2005, {{while in}} South Africa, Bush {{suggested}} her husband replace retiring Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O'Connor with another woman.

Later that month, after Miers had faced intense criticism, Laura Bush questioned whether <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> sexist in nature.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1977, Shakur {{pleaded not}} guilty to an {{attempted}} armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the Statler Hilton Hotel. Shakur was accused of attempting to rob a Michigan man staying at the hotel of $250 of cash and personal property. The prosecutor was C.

25|$|In general, if a {{defendant}} is found incompetent {{to proceed to}} trial, the criminal proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> petty, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the defendant is usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the defendant is restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|R

Survivors being pummeled are completely helpless and will <b>be</b> killed unless <b>the</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> killed. <b>The</b> <b>Charger</b> <b>is</b> also unique among the Special Infected in that, due to its hulking size, it cannot be shoved; only frag rounds and explosives can stumble a <b>charger.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charger</b> <b>is</b> also quite lethal in its standard melee attack while not charging.|$|R
5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon the Klan.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Price (1965), {{eighteen}} Ku Klux Klan {{members were}} charged with murder and conspiracy {{for the deaths of}} James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, but <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dismissed by the trial court. A unanimous Supreme Court, which included Black, reversed the dismissal and ordered the case to proceed to trial. Seven of these men, including fellow Klansmen Samuel Bowers, Cecil Price and Alton Wayne Roberts were found guilty of the crime; eight of them, including Lawrence A. Rainey, were found not guilty; and three of them, including Edgar Ray Killen, had their cases end in a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{over whether or}} not to defend pro-Nazi speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempt to}} have Spofford tried {{was not the}} end of the dispute. In October 1878 Eddy's husband and another student, Edward Arens, were charged with conspiring to murder Spofford. A barman said they had offered him $500 to do it; after a complex series of claims and counter-claims, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped when a witness {{retracted}} his statement. Eddy attributed the allegation to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of Science and Health, just published. Her lawyer had to apply for an attachment order against her house to collect his fee.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} censored {{news reports}} and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests. Most pro-government media held Hindus and communists responsible for encouraging the disorder and student unrest. The families of Abul Barkat and Rafiq Uddin Ahmed tried {{to charge the}} police with murder, but <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dismissed by the police. On 8 April government report on the incidents failed to show any particular justification for police firings on the students.

5|$|The next court {{session was}} on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an {{attorney}} for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a jidan settlement between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. had insisted on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> filed, she {{would not be able to}} withdraw them until the trial began.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the arrival}} of the Invalid Corps at West Point, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped, and Nicola was cleared of all charges. On August 4, 1781, Nicola complained to George Washington that the Corps would have great {{difficult}} during the winter time. Two months later on September 19, Nicola complained to General Horatio Gates about McDougall's lack of respect to the Corps. Eventually, Nicola proposed to Washington that the Invalid Corps should move back to Philadelphia; however, for various reasons, Washington denied it.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} during 1989, Hamm {{enrolled at}} the University of Texas, {{where he was a}} member of the Upsilon Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity. There, Hamm was arrested for participating with a violent hazing incident in November 1990. Mark Sanders was beaten with a paddle and a broom by other fraternity members, while Hamm was leading him with a hammer claw around Sander's testicles around the fraternity house; Sanders' clothes were also set afire. The incident resulted in the fraternity being shut down on campus. Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication; <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dismissed during August 1995.|$|E

5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997â2000. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies {{were said to be}} anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E
