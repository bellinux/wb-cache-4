25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the area}} was {{frequently}} mapped, due to its location on the Sweden-Norway frontier, which has existed since 1273. In that era, the massif was entirely Norwegian, but in 1644, Sweden succeeded in capturing Särna during the Torstenson War. However, in 1645, the Second Treaty of Brömsebro failed to clearly define the frontier, and not until 1751, after negotiations, was the current frontier established. If the wrangling over the border seemed to <b>take</b> <b>forever,</b> {{all the more so}} since the zone was so trivial. The area around the mountain was not settled until later. This began on the Norwegian side: there was at least one farm at Ljørdalen in 1528. Not until the 18th century did the Swedish part become populated, initially with cabins for transhumance, for example at Mörkret. Virtual villages grew up after the beginning of the 19th century at Gördalen, Storbäcken, Storbron, Hägnåsen, Mörkret, Tjärnvallen and Lillådalen. Many of the park trails date from this era of transhumance.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to <b>take</b> <b>forever</b> to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny but trying to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers figure out which ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he laughed with pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E

Following {{the release of the}} album, Cetera launched his first solo tour—accompanied by his River North labelmate, country singer Ronna Reeves—lasting into 1996. The tour had been delayed while Cetera recuperated from a motorcycle accident.|$|E

2500|$|Left Over Life to Kill was {{variously}} {{described as}} [...] "An assured and extremely vivid piece of music", [...] "In 25 minutes they {{might very well}} {{change the way you}} listen to music, 9.5/10", and [...] "Possibly the finest début EP by a band in Australian music history". McFarlane felt it [...] "contained a number of melancholy pieces" [...] typified by [...] "German Girl", [...] "Ashes" [...] and [...] "North of God". Left Over Life to Kill reached No.2 on the Australian Alternative Charts, and became one of the highest selling alternative releases of 1996. A second EP, Some Deaths <b>Take</b> <b>Forever,</b> followed – titled from graffito seen at the Brisbane venue, The Zoo. This EP has remixes of two tracks and out-takes from Left Over Life to Kill, and a cover version of The Triffids' song [...] "Raining Pleasure"; it was produced by the band. 2,000 hand-numbered copies were pressed and soon sold out. The cover art on these EPs and some subsequent releases maintained a stylistic uniformity, reminiscent of Penguin Books' Penguin Classics series. In September 1996 the group toured nationally supporting Tex Perkins.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty good". Gilbert said that the episode [...] "seemed to <b>take</b> <b>forever</b> to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for [...] "unimaginative material", and commented on the risqué oral sex scene. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction throughout the pilot, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more painful than clever.|$|E
