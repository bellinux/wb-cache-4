He {{was a member}} of the 'Devonshire' at the time I knew him, and was, I think, the most {{superior}} person I have ever met. He sneered at the Saturday Review as the pet journal of the suburban literary club; and at the Athenaeum as the <b>trade</b> <b>organ</b> of the unsuccessful writer. Thackeray, he considered, was fairly entitled to his position of favourite author to the cultured clerk; and Carlyle he regarded as the exponent of the earnest artisan. Living authors he never read, but this did not prevent his criticising them contemptuously. The only inhabitants of the nineteenth century that he ever praised were a few obscure French novelists, of whom nobody but himself had ever heard. He had his own opinion about God Almighty, and objected to Heaven on account of the strong Clapham contingent likely to be found in residence there. Humour made him sad, and sentiment made him ill. Art irritated him and science bored him. He despised his own family and disliked everybody else. For exercise he yawned, and his conversation was mainly confined to an occasional shrug.|$|E

Langton has written much for the Melbourne press, {{and was one of the}} earliest proprietors of the Spectator, a free <b>trade</b> <b>organ</b> started in 1865.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to {{determine}} the arguments for and against legalization of <b>organ</b> <b>trade.</b> Furthermore the study analyses and discusses whether the argument of a regulated <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> market, propounded by James Taylor, or the argument of an unchanged <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> market, propounded by Michael Sandel, is the fairest solution. The project will treat the arguments from a philosophical point of view. These arguments are divided into autonomy, exploitation, dignity and occupations, which contains risks. Initially the arguments are being evaluated by means of two types of argumentation analysis. Afterwards the study discusses {{the pros and cons of}} a legalized <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> market. Eventually the study assesses the possible challenges in every argument. In this study we have come to the conclusion that Taylor’s argument for legalized and regulated <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> is the fairest solution.

5000|$|The {{criminal}} justice perspective considers <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> from a legal, judicial viewpoint. Though many statutes regarding <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> exist, law officials {{have failed to}} enforce these mandates successfully. One barrier to enforcement {{is a lack of}} communication between medical authorities and law enforcement agencies. Often, enforcement officials' access to information regarding individuals involved in illegal organ transplants is hindered by medical confidentiality regulations. Without the ability to review medical records and histories to build an effective case against perpetrators, officials cannot fully enforce <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> laws. [...] Many critics state that in order to prohibit illegal <b>organ</b> <b>trading</b> effectively, {{criminal justice}} agencies must collaborate with medical authorities to strengthen knowledge and enforcement of <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> laws. Critics also support other criminal justice actions to meet this goal, such as prioritizing organ trafficking issues among local legislative bodies; multidisciplinary collaboration in cross-border offenses; and further police training in dealing with organ trafficking crimes.|$|R

They also argue that such a free market system for <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> would encourage <b>organ</b> theft through murder and neglect of sick individuals for financial gain. Advocates for the free market of organs counter these claims by saying that murder for financial gain already happens; sanctions against such acts exist to minimize their occurrence; and with proper regulation and law enforcement, such incidents in a legal <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> could be minimized as well.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, over 100 {{countries}} have passed legislation banning commercial organ transplantation. What explains this rapid, global diffusion of laws?

Moreover, the epistemic community helped position the <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> as an issue of societal and global importance, and it persistently encouraged states to undertake actions, such as implementing legislation, to combat the <b>organ</b> <b>trade.</b> Critically, the epistemic community’s efforts against the <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> incorporated the concepts of human rights, integrity, and dignity, which had diffused globally and become institutionalized in the period after WWII...|$|R
5000|$|According to <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> expert Nancy Scheper-Hughes of Organ Watch (in 2001), Israel {{had become}} a [...] "pariah" [...] in the organ {{transplant}} world. The lack of donations due to Jewish custom heightened the disparity between the supply and demand of organs. This led to the popularity of [...] "transplant tourism" [...] in which patients in need of organs travel to medical centres abroad to receive organs. Prior to the 2008 law prohibiting it, some Israeli organ brokers advertised {{on the radio and}} in newspapers. Kidneys, which are the most <b>traded</b> <b>organ,</b> may fetch up to $150,000 for brokers who usually pay the donors far less. The Jewish weekly newspaper The Forward reported in the wake of this scandal that an Organ Trafficking Prohibition Act of 2009, sponsored by Democratic Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, has yet to be officially introduced in the U.S., but that its proposed language cites Israel as a model of a country that has enacted a law providing benefits for organ donors.|$|R

The Muellers, through generations of eugenics, have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to obtain iron and other metals, they <b>trade</b> <b>organs</b> and body parts, which are harvested from radical regeneratives ("rads"). Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies can't distinguish between health and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of puberty, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.|$|R
50|$|The illegal <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> has {{at times}} led to murder for body parts, {{because of a}} {{worldwide}} demand of organs for transplant and organ donors.

50|$|The {{buying and}} selling of organs is {{prevalent}} in the black market of China. The <b>organ</b> <b>trade</b> is the <b>trade</b> of <b>organs</b> for organ transplantation. There {{is a shortage of}} organs available for transplantation which fuels a thriving black market for organs. Traditionally, Chinese culture dictates that organs should be buried and cremated in order for the individual to be reincarnated as a whole which has led to a dearth of bodies being donated. Therefore, China has resorted to harvesting organs from the bodies of prisoners for the use of organ transplants. According to an organ trafficking paper written by Budiani-Saberi and Delmonico, 11,000 transplants were performed in china using the organs of executed prisoners in 2006.|$|R
