5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began <b>to</b> <b>stir.</b>|$|E

5|$|Muramasa {{takes place}} on Honshu, the main island of the Japanese archipelago, with its overall style and setting drawing heavily upon Japanese {{folklore}} and mythology. It {{is set in the}} Genroku period, itself within the larger Edo period, during the reign of the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. Tsunayoshi's thirst for power has created conflict around ownership of the Demon Blades, samurai swords forged by the legendary swordsmith Muramasa Sengo that crave blood when drawn and bring madness and death to those foolish enough to draw them. Due to the chaos generated by this, the Demon Blades' powers begin summoning demons from Hell, along with causing ancient gods <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> from long slumber.|$|E

5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot that the author, Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E
5|$|The acute rice {{shortage}} prevailing in {{the state}} became an election issue with the DMK promising to supply three padis (approx. 4.5kg) of rice for 1 Rupee in its election manifesto. The DMK capitalised on the rice shortage as well as widespread discontent with the Bhaktavatsalam administration. Slogans like Kamarajar Annachi kadalaiparuppu vilai ennachu (Elder Brother (Annachi is a title historically been {{used to refer to}} a person of Kamaraj's caste) Kamaraj, what happened to the price of chana dal?), Bhaktavatsalam annachi arisi vilai ennachu (lit.

5|$|While Beauchamp's primary motive {{in killing}} Sharp was {{to defend the}} honor of his wife, {{speculation}} raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was {{a leader of the}} New Court party during the Old Court – New Court controversy in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a mulatto, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E

After the sesshin was concluded, he received dharma transmission (inka) from two masters, Keumbong and Keum'oh. He then went to see Kobong, who confirmed Seungsahn's enlightenment on January 25, 1949 and gave him dharma transmission as well. Seung Sahn {{is the only person}} Kobong gave Dharma transmission to.

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
5|$|Parkman also {{believed}} that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans {{in order to make}} trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying <b>to</b> <b>stir</b> up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.|$|E
50|$|Tower mills, {{often called}} {{vertical}} mills, stirred mills or regrind mills, are {{a more efficient}} means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, {{and can be used}} after ball mills in a grinding process. Like ball mills, grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added <b>to</b> <b>stirred</b> mills <b>to</b> help grind ore, however these mills contain a large screw mounted vertically to lift and grind material. In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding mills. Stirred mills are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry. There are several advantages to the tower mill: low noise, efficient energy usage, and low operating costs.|$|R
