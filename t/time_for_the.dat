5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire game or {{they may have to}} make a certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was then declared at this <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Yasawa Group, northern Viti Levu, Vanua Levu {{as well as}} smaller islands located nearby. Later that day, as Daman reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning. Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then later that day downgraded all the warnings that were still in effect for Fiji to gale force as Daman was weakening.|$|E
5|$|A new club named Andover Lions F.C. {{was formed}} two weeks later.

5|$|After {{missing the}} Australian {{victory in the}} Second Test due to injury, Meckiff {{returned}} for the Third Test and he was again attacked, taking 1/74 from 13 overs in the first innings, his sole victim being Conrad Hunte. He then broke down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1–1.

5|$|After {{the loss}} of Invincible, the two {{surviving}} ships had an uneventful <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the war conducting patrols of the North Sea, as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. They were put into reserve in early 1919 and sold for scrapping on 1 December 1921.|$|E
5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was partly as a deception measure, and partly because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and his players broke an agreement to return home in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it. To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake {{tends to}} be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce. However, using a chunky-style apple sauce {{can result in a}} cake with less moisture, {{compared}} to using standard apple sauce.

5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1991–92 season meant {{there was to be}} no demotion.|$|E

5|$|Bondi Junction had {{originally}} been intended only as an intermediate turnback station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction Turnback project saw a new rail crossover was built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.|$|E
