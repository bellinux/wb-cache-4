2500|$|In particular, Adorno despised {{jazz and}} popular music, viewing {{it as part}} of the culture industry, that {{contributes}} to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and [...] "agreeable". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing 'reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.' ...|$|E
2500|$|At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: [...] "Let me say this. Let me say {{something}} {{that may not be}} great politics. But I think the secretary is right. And that is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues that are [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|E
2500|$|Adorno's {{reputation}} as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death. [...] His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him {{to fall out of}} favour. [...] The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be [...] "preposterously over-rated." [...] The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book The Philosophy of New Music as [...] "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." [...] Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing [...] "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing [...] "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." [...] Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. [...] He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: [...] "I {{have never been able to}} bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." [...] On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno's In Search of Wagner, where Žižek attributes an [...] "emancipatory impulse" [...] to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands [...] "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study." ...|$|E

60|$|But the {{argument}} drawn from that comparison between our own conduct {{when we were}} creating our debt, and {{the conduct of the}} Americans while they have been creating their debt--during the twelve months from April 1, 1861, to March 31, 1862, let us say--is hardly a fair argument. We, at any rate, knew how to tax ourselves--if only the taxes might be forthcoming. We were already well used to the work; and a minister with a willing House of Commons had all his material ready to his hand. It has not been so in the United States. The difficulty has not been with the people who should pay the taxes, but with the minister and the Congress which {{did not know how to}} levy them. Certainly not as yet have those who are now criticising the doings on the other side of the water a right to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the carrying out of this war. No sign has as yet been shown of an unwillingness on the part of the people to be taxed. But wherever a sign could be given, it has been given on the other side. The separate States have taxed themselves very heavily for the support of the families of the absent soldiers. The extra allowances made to maimed men, amounting generally to twenty-four shillings a month, have been paid by the States themselves, and have been paid almost with too much alacrity.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> less apt than others to profit by experience, because the bustle of their lives keeps {{breaking}} the thread of that attention which is the material of memory, till no one has patience or leisure to spin from it a continuous thread of thought. We suspect {{that this is not}} more true of us than of other nations,--than it is of all people who read newspapers. Great events are perhaps not more common than they used to be, but a vastly greater number of trivial incidents are now recorded, and this dust of time gets in our eyes. The telegraph strips history of everything down to the bare fact, but it does not observe the true proportions of things, and we must make an effort to recover them. In brevity and cynicism it is a mechanical Tacitus, giving no less space to the movements of Sala than of Sherman, as impartial a leveller as death. It announces with equal sangfroid the surrender of Kirby Smith and the capture of a fresh rebel governor, reducing us to the stature at which posterity shall reckon us. Eminent contemporaneousness may see here how much space will be allotted to it in the historical compends and biographical dictionaries of the next generation. In artless irony the telegraph is unequalled among the satirists of this generation. But this short-hand diarist confounds all distinctions of great and little, and roils the memory with minute particles of what is oddly enough called intelligence. We read in successive paragraphs the appointment of a Provisional Governor of North Carolina, whose fitness or want of it may be the turning-point of our future history, and the nomination of a minister, who will at most only bewilder some foreign court with a more desperately helpless French than his predecessor. The conspiracy trial at Washington, whose result will have absolutely no effect on the real affairs of the nation, occupies for the moment more of the public mind and thought than the question of reconstruction, which involves the life or death of the very principle we have been fighting for these four years.|$|E

50|$|In addition, an {{increasing}} difficulty for providing well-versed Presidents is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> {{in recent years}} are, in increasing numbers, more distrustful of their government and longterm, career politicians.

50|$|The OWI {{suffered}} from conflicting aims and poor management. For instance, Elmer Davis, {{who wanted to}} “see <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> truthfully informed,” clashed with the military that withheld information for “public safety”. Further, OWI employees grew evermore dissatisfied with “what they regarded as a {{turn away from the}} fundamental, complex issues of the war in favor of manipulation and stylized exhortation”. On April 14, 1943, several OWI writers resigned from office and released a scathing statement to the press explaining how they no longer felt they could give an objective picture of the war because “high-pressure promoters who prefer slick salesmanship to honest information” dictated OWI decision-making. President Roosevelt’s “wait-and-see” attitude and wavering public support for OWI damaged public opinion of the agency.|$|E
2500|$|Carter {{was widely}} {{blamed for the}} return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that were last seen just after the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
