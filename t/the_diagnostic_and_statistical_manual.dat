5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.

5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

Among these is a larger number of disorders recognized by <b>the</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Manual; that <b>the</b> greater number of treatments available incentives physicians to look for symptoms of disease; and that changes in federal disability regulations have encouraged more people to seek disability benefits.|$|R
