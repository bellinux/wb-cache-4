5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett hit 115 in a rain-affected {{match that}} ended in a draw. Over the next month, he {{struggled}} in the county matches, scoring only 30 runs in total. The Australians were to be frustrated {{in the next three}} Tests. In the Second Test at Lord’s, Hassett made 104, top-scoring in Australia’s 346 despite being hindered by a bandaged right arm and cramps. England took a 26-run first innings lead, but Australia replied with 368. Hassett’s bowlers reduced England to 3/12 but <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> on to deny Australia victory. The Third Test was another wet affair. Hassett made 26 as Australia scored 318 and took a 42-run first innings lead, but they then collapsed to be 8/35. Australia was saved from defeat by the rain, which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible.|$|E
25|$|When ACT UP staged {{its first}} {{demonstration}} two weeks later, {{two hundred and}} fifty people descended on Wall Street to protest the relationship between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Burroughs Wellcome, the maker of AZT, charging the pharmaceutical manufacturer with profiteering. <b>They</b> <b>hung</b> an effigy of FDA Commissioner Frank Young in front of Trinity Church and tied up traffic for hours. Petrelis was one of seventeen demonstrators arrested for acts of civil disobedience.|$|E
25|$|By 1845, {{all that}} was left of the Stourbridge Lion was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry's owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who {{recognized}} the boiler's value as a piece of history, and reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (equal to $ today) in 1874. The owners weren't able to find a buyer so <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> onto it themselves.|$|E

25|$|Basel then faced Vitória de Guimarães of Portugal in the Third Qualifying Round. The {{first leg}} at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques on 13 August {{ended in a}} 0–0 draw. The second leg took place on 27 August at St. Jakob-Park, where Valentin Stocker gave Basel an early lead on 11 minutes before João Alves was fouled in the penalty area by François Marque and João Fajardo {{dispatched}} the spot-kick, just four minutes later to draw Vitória level. In the second half, the away side started well but Eren Derdiyok gave FCB a 2–1 lead which <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> on to, {{to qualify for the}} Champions League Group Stages.|$|E
25|$|The Nuggets duo of Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson got Denver {{off to a}} fast start, winning Game 1 {{and taking}} home-court {{advantage}} away from Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Despite the early letdown, the Spurs showed their championship mettle and bounced back for a 97-88 win in Game 2. In the pivotal Game 3, the Nuggets built an eight-point first-quarter lead before Manu Ginóbili's eight second-quarter points put San Antonio up 43-40 at halftime. A back-and-forth contest turned in the final 2:24 of the third quarter: Michael Finley hit two 3-pointers, and Robert Horry later hit a 3 that gave the Spurs a 75-67 lead {{at the end of}} the quarter. <b>They</b> <b>hung</b> on for a 96-91 win.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgarian {{army was}} well armed {{according}} to the Avar model: the soldiers had a sabre or a sword, a long spear and a bow with an arrow-quiver on the back. On the saddle <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> a round shield, a mace and a lasso, which the Bulgarians called arkani. On their decorated belts the soldiers carried the most necessary objects such as flints and steel, a knife, a cup and a needle case. The heavy cavalry was supplied with metal armour and helmets. The horses were also armoured. Armour was of two types— chain-mail and plate armour. The commanders had belts with golden or silver buckles which corresponded to their rank and title.|$|E

25|$|In February 2008, five campaigners {{from the}} Plane Stupid group gained {{admittance}} {{to the building}} as visitors and then moved {{up to the roof}} to demonstrate against the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport; from there <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> two banners they had smuggled past security. MPs and security experts found it worrying that the protesters made it to the roof in spite of the heightened security measures, and the prosecution at the activists' trial argued that they may have received help from a House of Lords employee. In October 2009, at least forty Greenpeace activists climbed to the roof of Westminster Hall to call for the adoption of policies combating climate change. Some of them climbed down after nearly five hours, while the rest spent the night on the roof.|$|E

The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring. As they took them off, Melina suggestively rubbed their abs while removing the title belts from their pants, where <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> in an exaggerated phallic fashion. Melina has a signature entrance which involves her doing a split on the ring apron—from the floor—then bending forward and crawling under the bottom rope.|$|E

500|$|On 29 October 1955, a {{group of}} nine {{students}} from University College Dublin obtained keys from the Pillar's custodian and locked themselves inside, {{with an assortment of}} equipment including flame throwers. From the gallery <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> a poster of Kevin Barry, a Dublin Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer executed by the British during the War of Independence. A crowd gathered below, and began to sing the Irish rebel song [...] "Kevin Barry". Eventually members of the Gardaí (Irish police) broke into the Pillar and ended the demonstration. No action was taken against the students, whose principal purpose, the Gardaí claimed, was publicity.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers. Before <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> up, Rogers warned him, [...] "your tomorrow {{will not be the}} same". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was about to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E

It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe.

500|$|From small {{clubs and}} hotels in London with {{little room for}} Jagger to move around to selling out stadiums worldwide, Rolling Stones tours have {{significantly}} changed over the decades. Setups for the band started off simplistic compared to what they later became in the band's career. with pyrotechnics, giant screens, and elaborate stage designs. By the Rolling Stones American tour of 1969, the band began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California. They were also using more equipment, such as lighting rigs and better sound equipment compared to the clubs. The 1969 tour is considered a [...] "great watershed tour" [...] by Mick Jagger {{due to the fact}} that they [...] "started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights". During the 1972 tour, the Stones developed a [...] "complex light show" [...] in which <b>they</b> <b>hung</b> up giant mirrors and bounced the light off them.|$|E

2500|$|Giants {{fans were}} enraged. For a {{football}} team to lose in that situation was unprecedented.
