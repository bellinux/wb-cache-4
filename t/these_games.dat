5000|$|The [...]450 Rigby was {{designed}} primarily to take heavy, thick skinned, dangerous game species. Due to the cartridge’s performance, {{it would be}} considered a better cartridge for <b>these</b> <b>game</b> species such as African elephant, Cape buffalo, rhinoceros and perhaps hippopotamus than the usual standby cartridges used on <b>these</b> <b>game</b> such as the [...]458 Winchester Magnum or even the [...]458 Lott cartridges especially if one was to use handloaded ammunition. When hunting <b>these</b> <b>game</b> species a bullet of a tough construction is required especially at the velocities the [...]450 Rigby is capable of attaining. It is important to tailor the performance to the velocity rating of the bullet with regard to this cartridge as it provides a step up in performance over the cartridges the [...]458 caliber (11.43 mm) bullets are manufactured for. This is especially true for soft-nosed bullets as they can open up too rapidly at velocities the [...]450 Rigby can attain. When hunting <b>these</b> <b>game</b> species only bullets weighing 450 - 600 gr g of a tougher construction should be used.|$|R
