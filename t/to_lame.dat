5|$|In early September Marquis went <b>to</b> <b>Lame</b> Deer for the Cheyenne annual fair. There, Willis Rowland {{helped him}} compile {{a list of}} elderly Cheyennes. Although the Custer {{battlefield}} was on the Crow Reservation, the Crow {{had been on the}} US side during the Great Sioux War of 1876, of which the Custer battle was a part, and so would have no eyewitnesses to the battle, everybody fighting with Custer having been killed. Back in Lodge Grass, Marquis made two important contacts. In November, he had his first meeting with Thomas H. Leforge. Leforge lived among the Crow and had been a scout and interpreter for General Gibbon in the 1876 war. Leforge would be the subject of the first book Marquis succeeded in publishing, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian. The second contact was William H. White, who was with the Second Cavalry under Gibbon. White would be the subject of Custer, Cavalry & Crows.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Lame Beaver discovers {{a strange}} rock in a creek in the mountains. It is {{actually}} gold, but the Arapaho chief knows nothing of its value. He makes {{it into a}} bullet for his new rifle. Pasquinel and his new bride Lise set up a proper household in St. Louis, but the fur trader feels out of place with the aristocratic society in which she lives. The citizens of St. Louis regard Indians as inferior, and hold {{that they must be}} assimilated into the white world, a view opposed by the more knowledgeable voyageur. He and McKeag eventually pack up and head westward <b>to</b> <b>Lame</b> Beaver's village. In the meantime, Lame Beaver leads his braves in a raid against the Pawnee, killing their chief using one of the golden bullets. But the Pawnee soon rally and the brave Arapaho is slain. Clay Basket is devastated when, with her widowed mother forsaken and her own fiance Pasquinel gone, the rest of the tribe ransacks their teepee. The old woman has to live out in the cold because no male family member is around to take her in.|$|E

500|$|Salon.com writer Heather Havrilesky {{called the}} episode an [...] "instant classic", and {{particularly}} praised the guest performance of Fred Armisen. She said the episode [...] "benefits from the show's writers' increasing habit of giving everything from political scandals <b>to</b> <b>lame</b> local events the Onion treatment". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said it was}} [...] "another strong one", and said the Leslie character is growing less clueless and more three-dimensional. Robert Philpot of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said he believed the show still too closely resembled The Office, but that [...] "Sister City" [...] "showed that Parks and Recreation can equal The Office for comic discomfort". Fowler of IGN said the anti-American sentiment demonstrated by the Venezuelan delegation [...] "was a funny twist that didn't completely wear itself out, although it came close". Fowler particularly praised Armisen, who he said risked overshadowing the regular cast, and the sardonic comedy of Plaza. Not all reviews were positive. The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce, who said he felt the second season had been excellent so far, described [...] "Sister City" [...] as [...] "easily the weakest episode of the season, maybe the series". Pierce called the political overtones [...] "ham-handed", the humor was too over-the-top, and the episode suffered from the absence {{of most of the}} supporting cast.|$|E
500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, {{and that she had}} told him <b>to</b> <b>lame</b> John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|E

2500|$|On {{their way}} back <b>to</b> <b>Lame</b> Beaver's Arapaho village, Pasquinel spots the same pirates who robbed him a year before. Using McKeag as bait, he lures the pirates in and fires at them. Pawnee warriors aid him as well, killing {{the rest of the}} pirates in {{retribution}} for their braves' deaths. McKeag is angered that Pasquinel would use such underhanded tactics, but it's just business for the voyageur. In a later encounter, a couple of Utes [...] "coup" [...] the white traders. Pasquinel warns McKeag not to harm them, and just fires over their assailant's heads to scare them off. McKeag tries shooting them and is lanced in the shoulder with a spear. Pasquinel manages to get the wounded McKeag <b>to</b> <b>Lame</b> Beaver's village, where the Scotsman recovers from his injuries. McKeag falls in love with Lame Beaver's beautiful daughter Clay Basket (Barbara Carrera), and she returns the Scotsman's love.|$|E
2500|$|The Twentieth Amendment (1933) {{changes the}} date on which a new President, Vice President and Congress take office, thus {{shortening}} the time between Election Day {{and the beginning of}} Presidential, Vice Presidential and Congressional terms. Originally, the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December unless otherwise provided by law. [...] This meant that, when a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a [...] "lame duck" [...] Congress convening in the interim. [...] By moving the beginning of the president's new term from March 4 to January 20 (and in the case of Congress, to January 3), proponents hoped to put an end <b>to</b> <b>lame</b> duck sessions, while allowing for a speedier transition for the new administration and legislators.|$|E
