5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult <b>to</b> <b>ignite,</b> large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E
5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult <b>to</b> <b>ignite,</b> but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.|$|E

5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate in all their nakedness {{the current state of}} mind and the new elements of struggle, which were <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> a fierce war that can end only with the fall of that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> fuel under the engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature) treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637, the ox bladder {{described}} by Jiao Yu is {{replaced with a}} lacquer bag and a cord pulled from a hidden ambusher located on the nearby shore, which would release a flint steel–wheel firing mechanism <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> the fuse of the naval mine.|$|E

5|$|The {{case had}} all the {{elements}} <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the poor girl, the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the detective work by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of the events), and Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement. As a consequence, the case created its own small industry.|$|E
5|$|X-Men had {{its premiere}} at Ellis Island on July 12, 2000, {{two days before}} a wide opening in 3,025theaters in North America. It would also debut in Australia that weekend to take {{advantage}} of the school holidays, while most other territories would get the film in August. Marvel Studios was depending on X-Mens success <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> other franchise properties (Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Daredevil).|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5000|$|The Diesel {{cycle is}} a {{combustion}} process of a reciprocating internal combustion engine. In it, fuel is ignited by heat generated during the compression of {{air in the}} combustion chamber, into which fuel is then injected. This is in contrast <b>to</b> <b>igniting</b> the fuel-air mixture with a spark plug as in the Otto cycle (four-stroke/petrol) engine. Diesel engines are used in aircraft, automobiles, power generation, diesel-electric locomotives, and both surface ships and submarines.|$|R

5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and would be used <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sega {{redesigned}} the Mark III {{for release}} in North America as the Sega Master System. This {{was followed by}} a European release the next year. Although the Master System was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by Nintendo. With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market, Sega's console R team, led by Masami Ishikawa and supervised by Hideki Sato, began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after that console launched.|$|E
5000|$|On July 6, 2013, Asiana Airlines Flight 214, a Boeing 777-200ER {{registered}} HL7742, crashed while landing. The {{tail section}} of the aircraft struck the seawall {{at the end of}} the runway and became detached from the airframe; the plane ended up 2,000 feet (600 meters) down the runway. Passengers and crew members evacuated before fire, due <b>to</b> <b>ignited</b> engine lubricating oil, destroyed the aircraft. There were three fatalities, making this the first fatal Boeing 777 crash.|$|R
25|$|While {{this seemed}} fine in theory, in {{practice}} it had multiple problems. The most prominent {{of all was}} that the arming method did not work as intended. In many cases pulling the loop was too difficult for one man to do and it required two men. For a lone soldier, the best method was to hold the grenade between the knees and pull on the loop with both hands. However, this often resulted in cutting the fingers in addition <b>to</b> <b>igniting</b> the fuse.|$|R
40|$|Employing the {{designer}} William Morris {{as a source}} of inspiration, this project seeks to explore the call for nature and beauty as a part of our lives. Moreover, it interweaves the necessity for experience of the sensual world (the five senses) with the cerebral world (a requisite <b>to</b> <b>igniting</b> the internal imagination) —a concept embodied {{in the form of the}} book. It advocates a redefining of the book as an imagination sculpture (the external and the internal) reflecting this new definition...|$|R
5|$|Skirmishes between Gabbar's {{gang and}} Jai-Veeru finally {{result in the}} capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai {{was wounded in the}} gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition. Meanwhile, Jai, who is {{continuing}} the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range.|$|E
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw and the other <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars {{as well as other}} conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Triethylborane is a {{substance}} which ignites the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. It {{was also used}} <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> the F-1 Engines on the Saturn V Rocket utilized by NASA's Apollo and Skylab programs from 1967 until 1973. Triethylborane is suitable for this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially {{the fact that it}} burns with a very high temperature. Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Model engine {{glow plugs}} {{are also used}} as {{re-usable}} igniters in theatrical pyrotechnics and the special effects industry <b>to</b> remotely <b>ignite</b> pyrotechnic devices using flash and smoke composition powders.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s several small fires also {{erupted in the}} Kings Park bushland due <b>to</b> people <b>igniting</b> sparklers at the event. This led to the {{eventual}} banning of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{definition of}} flash point refers <b>to</b> the <b>igniting</b> of a volatile material {{at the lowest}} temperature at which it can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air.|$|R
5|$|V for Vendetta is a 2005 dystopian {{political}} thriller film {{directed by}} James McTeigue and written by The Wachowski Brothers, {{based on the}} 1988 DC/Vertigo Comics limited series {{of the same name}} by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. The film is set in an alternative future where a neo-fascist regime has subjugated the United Kingdom. Hugo Weaving portrays V, an anarchist freedom fighter who attempts <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, and Natalie Portman plays Evey, a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission, while Stephen Rea portrays the detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained {{a large amount of}} flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough <b>to</b> <b>ignite</b> carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Unpopular tariffs {{are known}} <b>to</b> have <b>ignited</b> social unrest, {{for example the}} 1905 meat riots in Chile that {{developed}} in protest against tariffs applied to the cattle imports from Argentina.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} start the ramjets, a small 2 hp {{auxiliary}} power unit set the main rotor in motion. At a rotor-speed of 70 rpm, the ramjets were <b>to</b> be <b>ignited.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{upper layer}} gases are {{elevated}} in temperature {{and have the}} ability to radiate heat downward onto the tops of contents throughout the compartment. Fire investigators describe this consistent damage to tops of contents as radiant heat damage being caused by the upper layer. Correspondingly, this heat source is often attributed <b>to</b> <b>igniting</b> contents throughout the compartment, especially those items located relatively high in elevation around the compartment (e.g. curtains). Fire investigators commonly use the lack of thermal damage behind or under contents, known as protected areas, as evidence that the damage was caused by an upper layer.|$|R
