5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> the Northern Patagonian Batholith. This structure, formed by plutonic rocks including granodiorite and tonalite, is crossed north-south by the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone {{and surrounded by}} metamorphic rocks west and volcanic rocks east of the batholith.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, the history of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was {{at war with the}} Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of <b>the</b> <b>region),</b> <b>is</b> responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, the {{population}} of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> 1,262,783 with 53.05 per cent females.

5|$|Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay {{is one of}} California's most ecologically {{important}} habitats, providing key {{ecosystem services}} such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result {{of millions of years}} of tectonic plate movements. Because the Bay Area is crossed by six major earthquake faults, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. The climate is temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. The Bay Area is host to seven professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in the Bay Area is mutlifaceted and involves numerous local and regional actors, each with wide-ranging and overlapping responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, viticultural {{boundaries}} of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine producing districts- The Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. This area covers 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that {{are home to}} 5,000 growers who make their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sell grapes. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> set to expand to include 359 villages in the near future.|$|E
5|$|In its {{southern}} range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the titanosaur Alamosaurus, the ceratopsians Torosaurus, Bravoceratops and Ojoceratops, hadrosaurs {{which consisted of}} a species of Edmontosaurus, Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus, the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta, the oviraptorid Ojoraptosaurus, possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia, and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to have been}} dominated by semi-arid inland plains, following the probable retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> {{occupied}} by Japanese troops. In 1945, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> liberated by <b>the</b> joint Filipino and American troops with Capiznon guerrillas.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
5|$|Northwest Argentina is {{predominantly}} dry, hot, and subtropical. Owing to its rugged and varied topography, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> climatically diverse, {{depending on the}} altitude, temperature and distribution of precipitation. Consequently, the vegetation will also differ. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region has five different climate types: semi–arid (BS), arid (BW), temperate without a dry season and temperate with a dry season (Cf and CW respectively), and, at the highest altitudes, an alpine.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located some {{distance}} from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E

5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Chiapas was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Mexican state of Chiapas. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> physically diverse, featuring a number of highland areas, including the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and the Montañas Centrales (Central Highlands), a southern littoral plain known as Soconusco and a central depression formed by the drainage of the Grijalva River.|$|E
5|$|The {{amphibians}} of the Western Ghats are {{diverse and}} unique, {{with more than}} 80% of the 179 amphibian species being endemic to the rainforests of the mountains. The endangered purple frog was discovered in 2003. Four new species of frogs belonging to the genera Rhacophorus, Polypedates, Philautus and Bufo were described from the Western Ghats in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> also home to many caecilian species.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> {{home to a}} Neanderthal culture such as {{has been}} found at the Shanidar Cave. <b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> host to <b>the</b> Jarmo culture circa 7000BC.

5|$|The {{dominant}} language of <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> Mayali, a dialect of Bininj Gun-Wok traditionally {{associated with the}} region surrounding Maningrida, in Western Arnhem Land. As it is a strong language with hundreds of speakers and {{a high rate of}} child acquisition, members of the Wagiman ethnic group gradually ceased teaching the Wagiman language to their children. As a result, many Wagiman people speak Mayali, while only a handful of elders, possibly no more than six, speak Wagiman.|$|E
5|$|The five {{best known}} appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly {{known as the}} Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbières AOC, Faugères, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast {{majority}} of Languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500. However, the appellation system in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. One recent change is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon.|$|E
5|$|The {{most populous}} {{community}} in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> Pasadena (though Houston {{is a much}} larger city, the portion within this region is smaller than Pasadena).

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> almost uninhabited, {{and there}} was only a {{military}} colony until 1897, with the creation of a postal office in <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Given <b>the</b> little attention of the political authorities, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> very predated by foreigners, mainly Argentines.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> not known, however later {{research suggests that}} the North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, and it is likely that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>region</b> <b>is</b> {{best known}} for its Pinot noir, and also {{produces}} large amounts of Pinot gris, Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, and Riesling.
