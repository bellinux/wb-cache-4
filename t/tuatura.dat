Jeremy Wakefield is a young New Zealander who can see through time {{with the help of}} a third eye. He explained that with two eyes, we can see three dimensions and with three eyes through four dimensions. The fourth dimension is time.

After aiding the Super Friends fight against a time menace, <b>Tuatura</b> becomes a member of the Global Guardians.|$|E
