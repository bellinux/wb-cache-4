40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} improvement of denim fabric appearance by reducing the residual <b>torque</b> of weft <b>yarns.</b> In this paper, 100 % cotton low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns</b> of linear density 84 tex and 58 tex with different twist levels were produced by a new method of producing low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns</b> on a modified ring spinning machine. The results from the experiments show that the low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns</b> possess lower yarn snarling turns. Based on the mechanism analysis of 'small snake' pattern, the low <b>torque</b> ring <b>yarns</b> were applied to the denim fabric to improve fabric smoothness appearance. The experimental study demonstrates that the 'small snake' pattern of the denim fabrics has been greatly decreased by using the low residual <b>torque</b> ring <b>yarns</b> as weft yarns. Objective measurements of the low stress mechanical and surface properties of denim fabrics using low <b>torque</b> and conventional <b>yarns</b> were conducted. The {{results show that the}} denim fabric using the low <b>torque</b> ring <b>yarns</b> as weft yarns presents a smoother and more even surface. Moreover, a multiple comparisons LSD test of fabric properties indicates that there is no significant difference on tensile strength and tearing strength between fabric samples using the low <b>torque</b> ring <b>yarns</b> and conventional ring yarns with normal twist level as weft yarns, respectively. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that the 'small snake' pattern of the fabric decreased with the reduction of weft yarn snarling. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comparative}} study on the structural characteristics of three-dimensional fiber configurations in low torque and ring spun yarns. Three-dimensional configurations of tracer fibers in {{the two types of}} yarns were measured by a continuous measurement system. Critical parameters were obtained, including the occurrence frequencies of unique features, the radial position, fiber spatial orientation angle, migration frequency, and amplitude. Results reveal that nearly half of the fiber specimens in low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns</b> followed a deformed non-concentric conical helix of which the size of helical loops varies significantly and the axis of the helix does not coincide with the yarn axis. Local reversion phenomena appear on many fiber segments. In addition, most fibers in low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns</b> are located close to the yarn center, and alter their radial position in a yarn with larger amplitude. Those features offer an explanation for the excellent physical properties of low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns,</b> that is, low twist, high strength, and low residual torque.

40|$|The <b>torque</b> in single-spun <b>yarns</b> is an {{inherent}} {{property of the}} twisting and bending of staple fibres during the formation of yarn combined with the effect of applied tension on the yarn. The consequences of <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> are well known and are widely observed as yarn instability, e. g., yarn rotation under tension; local snarling and entanglement at low loads, and as distortion in fabric, i. e., edge-curl and skewing in knitted fabric. In this paper, a method for predicting the <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> based on the {{radial basis function networks}} is presented and evaluated. This method uses a 'universal approximator' based on neural network methodology to minimize noise during training of the network and to approximate the <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> {{as a function of the}} geometrical and physical parameters of yarns (twist, linear density) and the applied load. The current method is an integral radial basis function network-based approach suitable for textile engineering and gives very good prediction of <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> across a range of yarn structural parameters and test conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{low torque}} {{spinning}} method has been recently developed by integrating the ring spinning process with false twisting techniques. As {{a result of}} false twist and true twist, a novel single <b>yarn</b> of low <b>torque</b> and soft handle is generated. Based on the similar spinning principle, this paper proposed a 2 -step spinning method, which is composed of twisting-anduntwisting operation and {{can be considered as}} a variant of the low torque spinning method. The proposed spinning method separates the false twisting process into twisting and untwisting processes which are combined in one step in the low torque spinning method. In this paper, physical properties of yarns produced by the proposed spinning method were evaluated and compared with the conventional yarns. Influences of various spinning parameters on the properties of 2 -step yarns were also examined. Furthermore, a systematic study of the physical properties of the 2 -step yarns and resultant fabrics with respect to the conventional and low torque ones was carried out. The experimental results showed that the 2 -step yarns exhibit slightly higher tenacity, lower wet snarl and much less hairiness than the conventional yarns, which, however, are inferior to the low <b>torque</b> <b>yarns,</b> particularly the evenness. The fabrics made by the 2 -step yarns show the softest handle feeling, best airpermeability and moderate spirality angle with acceptable pilling resistance. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and torque or twist-liveliness is created. The <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> causes <b>yarn</b> instability, manifested as snarling or entanglements, and this instability must be controlled during manufacturing processes. Generally, the <b>torque</b> depends on <b>yarn</b> geometric {{factors such as}} the yarn twist, linear density and the fibre properties. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold yarn. This twisting or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free. In the present paper, the stability of plied textile yarns will be evaluated using the Topological Conservation law (Fuller, F. B., 1971, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 68, 815 – 819.) developed to study the post-buckling behaviour of twisted rods by Van der Heijden et al. (Int. J. Mech. Sci., 45, 161 – 196, 2003). The present work considers the equilibrium configuration of a series of multi-ply twisted yarns (2, 4, and 6 strands) of finite length. Several structural and mechanical properties are highlighted: (i) the influence of structural properties (the number of strands, the strand linear density and strand twist) and the ratio of the torsional and bending stiffnesses of the strands on the balance point in multi-ply yarns. The topological invariant of the twisted yarn (link) is used to calculate the ply and strand properties (writhe) and compared with experimental results obtained at CSIRO. The inter-strand pressure between strands of a multi-ply yarn, a feature of interest for fibre interactions in yarn structures, is also calculated at the balance situation across a range of structural and mechanical conditions...|$|R

40|$|A new {{knitted fabric}} {{mechanical}} model was developed using the energy model of knitted loop which {{was described in}} a previous paper [Textile Res. J. 73 (8), 739 - 748 (2003) ]. It was assumed that {{the shape of the}} yarn after knitting was curved and had non-linear mechanical properties. In developing the model, the effect of residual <b>torque</b> on <b>yarn</b> was considered. The loops were allowed to rotate such that the geometry of each loop was no longer symmetrical. The new fabric model allowed predictions of both fabric dimensions and wale spirality. Experimental results showed that there was excellent agreement between the calculated and measured values for both course spacing and spirality. For the first time, wale spirality was predicted within a theoretical framework. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{analysis of the}} mechanical governing equations applying to the torsional behaviour of multi-ply yarns under tension has been carried out. This analysis clearly shows {{that there are two}} components, a geometric component that determines the slope or gradient of the torque due to tension and a component that determines the <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> at zero applied tension (intrinsic torque) that depends on the fibre number, fibre moduli and diameter as well as the strand structural geometry. The effect of the ratio of the ply twist to the spinning twist on the two components of <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> has been numerically analysed for two-, three- and four-ply yarns prepared from singles 31 yarns spun with different spinning twists and for two different fibre diameters. Other comparisons are made for two-ply yarns prepared from 40 and 80 tex singles yarn. The model allows the effects of the various yarn and fibre parameters to be assessed and compared with experimental data. Experimental torque data for a range of two-ply yarns plied at different percentages of the singles spinning twist and also with different yarn histories and test environments are consistent with the trends identified by the model...|$|R

Yarn structure can be improved and <b>yarn</b> residual <b>torque</b> can be reduced significantly with an attachment installed on the conventional ring spinning frame. During an experiment, a fabric sample was produced by using the Nu-Torque yarns as weft yarns, to evaluate the effects of weft <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> on the 'small snake' pattern of denim fabrics.

Its incorporation into the ring spinning process without the need of an additional step is seen as its main advantage. It also requires only the attachment of a modification device to a conventional ring frame. The operating principle of TFS ring spinning is demonstrated. The efficiency of the modification process can be monitored by measuring the 'wet snarling' properties of the modified yarns produced. The modified yarn's achievement of a 38 % reduction in spirality of a circular knit fabric as compared to its ring-spun counterpart is noted. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Staple fibre yarns vary quite {{markedly}} in {{linear density}} (tex) along their length {{and the degree}} to which twist redistributes from thick to thin places will affect the strength, torque and extension behaviour of the yarn. Theory suggests that twist along worsted yarns should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean <b>torque</b> of worsted <b>yarns</b> reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun marl yarns, down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level worsted yarns that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6. The results and theory provide a guide as to the effect the observed large variations in linear density will have on yarn properties such as tenacity and torque. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} helix with variable radius is developed to analyze geometric and mechanical properties of a migrating fiber. The factors concerned include the frequency and amplitude of fiber migration {{as well as the}} equivalent radial position and equivalent helix height of the fiber. This treatment permits the application of experimentally determined migration patterns defined by those factors. The derived properties are the curvature and torsion components of the migrating fibers, bending moments, torque, strain energy distribution, and total strain energy. The terminal force and couple are calculated as functions of the length of the helix axis. A critical migration amplitude is identified where the axial component of the couple and transverse component of the force change their direction. The implication of these behaviors for yarn properties such as total <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> and local pressure distribution is also revealed. Cylindrical and sinuous helices are compared, with the effects of the amplitude and frequency of fiber migration quantitatively determined. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Slender yarn {{structure}} {{made from}} natural fibers, nano-fibers, carbon nanotubes or {{other types of}} fibrous materials is all formed by twisting an assembly of short or long fibers and its performance is significantly influenced by the physical behavior of these fibers in the slender yarn forming region - a small triangle area called spinning triangle. In this paper, a new generalized FEM model of spinning triangle has been developed to theoretically analyze the fiber structural and mechanical performance in fabrication of these slender yarn structures. In this proposed model, a geometrical model of spinning triangle is developed and the initial conditions are formulated together with algorithms for fiber buckling. Compared with the earlier models, some important parameters ignored previously such as the inclined angle of spinning tension and fiber torsional strains are considered. Fiber tensions predicted by the model are in good agreements with earlier models while the predicted <b>torque</b> of slender <b>yarns</b> is generally more close to experimental measurements.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the spinning triangle influences the distribution of fiber tension in the spinning triangle and fiber tensile stresses within the yarn and, thus, affects the component of <b>yarn</b> <b>torque</b> due to these stresses. In this study, a modified energy approach was adopted to study the distribution of fiber tension in the staple spinning triangle. The spinning triangle had an asymmetric geometry, unlike that studied by other researchers. A shape parameter {{was introduced in the}} analysis. The principle of minimum potential energy was applied to analyze three cases, that is, spinning triangle with uniformly distributed fibers, spinning triangle with fiber substrands and spinning triangle with buckled fibers. The effects of shape of spinning triangle on the fiber tension distribution at the spinning triangle were investigated. The results showed that the tension distribution of fibers at the spinning triangle became more uniform with the increase of the symmetry of the spinning triangle. In addition, as yarn twist increased, more tension of outer fibers was created and more compressive force developed on the central fibers in the spinning triangle. Compared with fiber tension distribution at the spinning triangle without fiber buckling, the fiber tensions distributed at the spinning triangle exhibited different shapes and had lower values with fiber buckling.

With an output of 32. 9 million tons in 2009, spun yarns satisfy more than half the needs of the global textiles and clothing industry. The present study is devoted to developing computational and digital methods and systems for the accurate and efficient analysis of three predominant aspects of spun yarns: yarn formation, internal structure and surface appearance. In this study, a new generalized theoretical model has been developed by using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the theoretical and numerical analysis of yarn formation in spinning triangle. In this proposed model, the initial conditions are formulated together with an algorithm for fiber buckling. Compared with the earlier models, some important parameters ignored previously, such as inclined angle of spinning tension, frictional contact of fibers with bottom roller and fiber torsional strains, are considered. Numerical simulations were then carried out to explore the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of ring spinning triangle and various spinning parameters. Further comparison results showed that fiber tensions predicted by the proposed model are in good agreements with earlier models while the calculated <b>torque</b> of <b>yarns</b> is generally closer to experimental measurements. Moreover, a dynamic model of spinning triangle has been further developed in this study based on the above static FEM model with consideration of the dynamic characteristics of fiber inertia and damping for a more complete and accurate description. By this model, the dynamic behavior of fibers in spinning triangle, such as the natural frequency, mode shape, resonant response, harmonic analysis and response under a time-varying tension, has been originally studied. The results showed that dynamic parameters have a great influence on the amplitude and attenuation of the response of constituent fibers in spinning triangle. Tracer fiber measurement has been widely used for analysis of yarn internal structure by tracing the fiber path in a transparent liquid. Currently, the image mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images largely involve manual operation. It is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent computer method has been developed for automatic mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images. In this method, an extended QRS complex detection method is developed for tracer fiber detection. A decision function, integrating several matching functions extracted from tracer fiber and gradient image, is proposed for image mosaic. An objective method is then proposed to evaluate the qualities of image mosaic and segmentation of the proposed method. Fifty series of tracer fiber images (total 872 images) with five different yarn counts (10 Ne~ 60 Ne) were prepared and used for a full evaluation of the proposed image processing method with respect to conventional manual method. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method works well in mosaic and segmentation for tracer fiber images and presents a much higher efficiency than the conventional method. For yarn surface evaluation, an intelligent computer method has been developed to analyze yarn blackboard image and objectively evaluate yarn quality using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The evaluation method for yarn surface quality currently in use is mainly based on manual inspection. Although some works have been done on digital yarn analysis in order to resolve the limitations of human visual inspection, none of them can fully imitate human behavior in the inspection of yarn quality on a blackboard according to ASTM D 2255 standard. In the proposed method, a multi-scale attention model is proposed and developed, which can fully imitate human attention at different observation distances for the whole and detailed yarn information. A Spectral Residual method is then extended to establish a general benchmark for the comparison among different grade yarns. In the developed system, Fourier transform is employed to separate yarn diameter and hairs, and image conspicuity is obtained by the multi-scale attention model. Total sixteen features, obtained from yarn diameter, hairiness and image conspicuity, are extracted to present the yarn surface characteristics and then used to classify and grade yarn surface qualities using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Two kinds of PNNs, i. e. global and individual PNNs, and two types of classification, i. e. eight-grade and five-grade classifications, are designed and developed for various yarn quality classification purposes. For the evaluation of the proposed method, a database was constructed with 296 yarn board images, covering eight yarn counts (7 Ne~ 80 Ne) and different grades. Experimental results showed that the accuracy for eight-and five-grade global PNNs are 92. 23 % and 93. 58 %, respectively, demonstrating a good classification performance of the proposed digital method in yarn surface grading. Finally, with the above developed computer methods, two intelligent digital systems have been developed for the computerized analysis and evaluation of yarn internal structure and surface appearance, respectively. The systems were designed for controlling and visualizing the whole process of yarn measurement and analysis, covering image acquisition, image processing and data analysis with interactive and user-friendly interface. Both digital systems are potential for application in textile laboratories and spinning mills for yarn structure and surface analyses. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.
