40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of high-speed mobile communications, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has reinforced the <b>tidal</b> <b>traffic</b> phenomenon, which induces spatio-temporal disequilibrium in the network traffic load. The main reason for <b>tidal</b> <b>traffic</b> is the large-scale population migration between business areas {{during the day and}} residential areas during the night. Traffic grooming provides an effective solution to aggregate multiple fine-grained IP traffic flows into the optical transport layer by flexibly provisioning lightpaths over the physical topology. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive study on energy efficiency and network performance enhancement in the presence of <b>tidal</b> <b>traffic.</b> We propose and leverage the concept of stateful grooming to apply differentiated provisioning policies based on the state of network nodes. We formulate and solve the node-state-decision optimization problem, which can decide the specific state of network nodes when a certain traffic profile is given, considering the trade-off between energy efficiency and blocking performance with a multi-objective integer linear program (MOILP). Then, we propose an online traffic-aware intelligent differentiated allocation of lightpaths (TIDAL) algorithm, based on stateful grooming and the MOILP, to accommodate the dynamic <b>tidal</b> <b>traffic.</b> Our illustrative numerical results show that the proposed method can achieve a significant performance improvement in an energy-efficient way...|$|E

Based on the {{analysis}} of setting principles of tidal lane, this paper describes the traffic and technical feasibility on setting tidal lane aat Xizhimen Outer Street between Chedaogou Bridge and Sijiqing Bridge, and then put forward a package on setting of tidal lane and control approaches of segment and endpoint. Through {{an analysis of the}} package, we expect to relieving road network pressure from <b>tidal</b> <b>traffic</b> and achieving the purpose of easing traffic congestion. ...|$|E

40|$|Johar Market {{region is}} one of {{shopping}} facility regions in Semarang. The existence of Johar Market serves public in trade sector and influences Semarang economic activity. However, there are now various problems occurred in this market that will certainly influenc the consumer's perception. The research aims to identify and to analyze the service improvement of market facilities in Johar Market region based on consumer's satisfaction level and to direct the service quality improvement of the market facilities. This research uses qualitative explanatory analysis that is to describe the existing conditions and activities in Johar Market region and qualitative comparative analysis {{that is used to}} analyze the service improvement of the market facilities. The result shows that generally the consumers consider that Johar market facilities have not yet accommodated their needs and interests. The consumers dissatisfy with bad air circulation and illumination, pedestrian's circulation, and supporting infrastructure. Their perceptions are worsen by the street vendors disturbance, <b>tidal</b> flooding problems, <b>traffic</b> jam, in-disciplined public transportation, unavailability of pedestrians, lack of vegetation, and environmental chaos. Thus the consumers demand an improvement to give satisfaction during shopping. Based on some necessities for facility services at Johar Market region, it is recommended to discipline and relocate the street vendors, re-converse the square to be public space, manage Johar Market region without changing its characteristics as historical region, create it to be shopping tourism region, and improve the supporting infrastructure and commodity which will attract community and stakeholder participation in the ethic to develop...|$|R
