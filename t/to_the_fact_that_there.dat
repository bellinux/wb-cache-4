5|$|Several details {{contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are only}} a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are wrought iron items from China dating to that period {{and there is no}} documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

25|$|Mesoamerican {{cultures}} {{that lived in}} the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Northampton {{had become}} a major centre of {{footwear}} and leather manufacture. In 1801, the population was 7,020; it more than doubled to 15,351 in 1831, attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was great demand for footwear caused by the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A third of the adult males alone were shoemakers at the time.

25|$|In 2012, the Anzac Test {{was held}} in New Zealand {{for the first time}} since 1998, which was the Kiwis last win in the fixture. Home {{advantage}} made no difference for the Kiwis as Sheens' Kangaroos won the match by eight points. The Kangaroos took on the Kiwis one more time later in the year, this time in Townsville. In front of a sold-out crowd, the Kangaroos won the test-match with another eight point victory. There was no tournament this year due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a World Cup next year for the teams to prepare for.|$|E
25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she did when she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E
5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. This may be due both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swedes for military protection.|$|R
50|$|The National Gallery of B&H {{was closed}} in September 2011 {{for almost a}} year due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{authorities}} were neglecting <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> resolve its status which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gallery was unable to appoint new director.

50|$|The {{rejection}} was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demand had insufficient details regarding <b>the</b> methodology, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it {{is unlikely}} that cell differentiation occurs during an incubation period so short (from 40 minutes to 2 hours) and that the appearance of the nerve cells in the cultivation might be the result of cytotoxic changes.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, but not because of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was that the place was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not stick out from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did and still do. (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had once been such a site there.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, {{that there are}} also {{critical}} voices from environmental organisations for example. That is in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are European Organic Regulations such as (EC) No 834/2007 or the new draft from 2014 but no comparable regulations for Integrated Farming. Whereas organic farming and the “Bio-Siegel” in Germany for example are legally protected, EU Commission has not yet considered to start working on a comparable framework or blueprint for Integrated Farming. When products are marketed as “Controlled Integrated Produce”, according control mechanisms and quality-labels are not based on national or European directives but are established and handled by private organisations and quality schemes such as LEAF Marque.|$|E

25|$|Shallow water {{blackout}} – {{caused by}} hyperventilation prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing. Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E
