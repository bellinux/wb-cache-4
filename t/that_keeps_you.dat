Tellingly, none of them really address the fundamental gripes that dragged the game down in the first place." [...] He was critical of the graphics, arguing [...] "the game looks like a port from the word go.

He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs {{on the back of}} your neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence". Matt Hall noted the ability of the group for [...] "trotting out jolly tunes about mental breakdown, love bordering on obsession and severely dislocated relationships." [...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> listening again and again".|$|E
