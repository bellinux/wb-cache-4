25|$|About 80 {{percent of}} {{patients}} are adolescents when they first experience KLS. On some occasions though, its first occurrence comes in childhood or adulthood. In most adolescent-onset patients, symptoms cease {{by the time they}} are 30 years old.

Unusually young or old patients and those who experience hypersexuality tend to have a more severe course. Patients who initially have frequent attacks generally see the disease cease earlier than others. The condition spontaneously resolves, and the patient is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cured</b> if there have been no symptoms for six years.|$|E
