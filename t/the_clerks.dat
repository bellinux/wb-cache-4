5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about other}} {{subjects}} besides revenues also {{is contained in}} the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls also allow {{the identification of the}} custodians of royal lands and castles. <b>The</b> <b>clerks</b> writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|The Inns of Chancery or Hospida Cancellarie were a {{group of}} {{buildings}} and legal institutions in London initially attached to the Inns of Court and used as offices for <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of chancery, from which they drew their name. Existing from at least 1344, the Inns gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors (as the Inns of Court were to barristers) and a place of initial training for barristers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> County <b>Clerk</b> {{is elected}} for a {{four-year}} term and {{is responsible for}} keeping records of births, deaths, assumed names, co-partnerships, and issuing and filing marriage licenses. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Clerk's</b> office processes gun permits and notary bonds. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> also serves as <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Board of Commissioners, the Board of Canvassers, the Gun Board, and is <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Circuit Court. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> {{is also a member}} of the Plat Board and Election Commission. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> also serves as an officiant for wedding ceremonies.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Parliaments is <b>the</b> chief <b>clerk</b> and {{officer of}} the House of Lords (but is {{not a member of}} the House itself). <b>The</b> <b>Clerk,</b> who is {{appointed}} by the Crown, advises the presiding officer on the rules of the House, signs orders and official communications, endorses bills, and is the keeper of the official records of both Houses of Parliament. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Parliaments is responsible for arranging by-elections of hereditary peers when necessary. The deputies of <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Parliaments (<b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> Assistant and <b>the</b> Reading <b>Clerk)</b> are appointed by the Lord Speaker, subject to the House's approval.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> House of Commons {{advises the}} Speaker of the House of Commons and Members of Parliament {{on matters of}} {{parliamentary}} procedure.

5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} a theological or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.|$|E
5|$|On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the {{landmark}} case of Obergefell v. Hodges, , holding {{that the fundamental}} right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage licenses for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage licenses, the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such licenses, and <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing licenses due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses immediately.|$|E

5|$|The only clue {{found at}} the scene is a Lucky Boy {{employee}} button. Mulder and Scully check all of the employees and discover that one of <b>the</b> <b>clerks,</b> Derwood Spinks, is missing his button. Scully suspects Spinks after it is discovered he has a criminal record. Mulder, however, believes that the victim's brain was removed by a proboscis, and suspects another employee, Rob Roberts, of committing the murder. Rob, who is actually a mutant human who wears a disguise to hide his true physical body, subsists on brains in order to survive. When Rob's landlady, Sylvia Jassey, is trailed by a private investigator (Steve Kiziak), Rob kills him and eats in order to placate his hunger, which begins to {{get more and more}} uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of the Court.|$|E

5000|$|In 1858 Campbell was {{designated}} as <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> General Assembly and on 22 December 1868, {{on the recommendation}} of Premier Edward Stafford, he {{was designated}} as <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments. <b>The</b> title of <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments is traditionally conferred on <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> of <b>the</b> upper house in a Westminster parliamentary system but Stafford advised the Governor to appoint Campbell to this office as he was far more experienced than <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Legislative Council. The Legislative Council refused to recognise Campbell as anything more than acting in the role of <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments, stating that he was not correctly appointed (the Council was not consulted and the appointment was not Gazetted) and that his duties were never defined. A compromise resolution to this impasse was eventually reached with the passing of <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments Act, 1872, which provided that Campbell would continue to be <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments {{for as long as he}} held <b>the</b> office of <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> House of Representatives; after which subsequent appointments would be made [...] "in accordance with the law and usage of the Imperial Parliament". Accordingly, Leonard Stowe, who was appointed <b>Clerk</b> of <b>the</b> Legislative Council in 1865, was appointed as <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Parliaments when Campbell retired in 1889.|$|R

5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{was founded}} in the early 13th century, and {{dedicated}} to Thomas Becket. The founder, William de Courtney, was a grandson of Reginald Fitzurse, one of Becket's murderers. In 1849 a reliquary was found in St Paul's Church, Kewstoke that was believed to have come originally from the priory and to contain the blood of Thomas Becket. It is {{believed that it was}} moved to St Paul's for safe keeping {{at the time of the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries and is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The first building had been completed by 1242 as it is described in a letter to Jocelin of Wells. The foundation was confirmed by Edward II in 1325. It was home to a small community of Victorine Canons. The Victorine order were founded at the Abbey of St. Victor, Paris and founded St Augustine's Abbey in Bristol which became Bristol Cathedral. Members of the priory were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and self-sufficiency so that <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> who had taken holy orders worked on the farm. The priory also provided the clergy for the local parish Church of St Paul, Kewstoke.|$|E

In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune.

25|$|Gerard was {{promoted}} in 1581 to be Master of the Rolls, the chief administrative {{post in the}} Court of Chancery and second most senior judge in the land.

The posts of <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of the petty bag, the examiners and <b>the</b> <b>clerks</b> of the rolls chapel, usher, crier and doorkeeper, his three secretaries and numerous minor posts all fell within his patronage, so {{he was able to}} make considerable extra profits from the sale of offices.|$|E
