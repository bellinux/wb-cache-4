5|$|By the 1880s the {{influence}} of the Sheffield FA started <b>to</b> <b>wane.</b> Internal troubles began to surface with disputes between the SFA and a new rival association, Hallamshire F.A. The former, led by Charles Clegg, also fought a losing battle against the onset of professionalism. By the middle of the decade several local clubs, including Sheffield and Hallam F.C., were in financial trouble.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's public {{popularity}} as a virtuoso began <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> as did {{the number}} of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has been mostly positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements. However, some found fault with the show's pacing, {{believing that the}} storyline quality begins <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> {{after the first few}} episodes. Sunrise produced a spin-off television series titled , which aired in Japan in 1999. Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel {{in the form of a}} single-episode (OVA) called Sword of Wind, but production never began.|$|E

5|$|During {{that same}} year, {{a series of}} {{scalding}} cases, including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the hot spring, prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be cautious to hot mineral springs. As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay, and the RSAF redevelopment, public interest began <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> {{and the number of}} visitors dwindled.|$|E
5|$|Five large stelae {{were raised}} in 741, {{although}} {{the name of the}} king responsible is illegible on all of them and he has been labelled as Ruler Y. Calakmul's presence in the wider Maya area continued <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> with two of the city's major allies suffering defeats at the hands of Tikal. El Peru was defeated in 743 and Naranjo a year later and this resulted in the final collapse of Calakmul's once powerful alliance network, while Tikal underwent a resurgence in its power.|$|E
5|$|In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp was in {{the middle}} of a bitter {{political}} battle known as the Old Court-New Court controversy. He identified with the New Court, or Relief party, which promoted a legislative agenda favorable to debtors. In opposition was the Old Court, or Anti-Relief party, which worked to secure the rights of creditors to collect debts. Sharp had served as the state's attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party's power was beginning <b>to</b> <b>wane.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be disconnected from his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 8th century, the {{dominant}} Anglo-Saxon ruler was King Æthelbald of Mercia, who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River Humber. Æthelbald was one of a number of strong Mercian kings who ruled from the mid-7th century to the early 9th, and it was not until the reign of Egbert of Wessex in the 9th century that Mercian power began <b>to</b> <b>wane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although {{in stark contrast to}} the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal with the realities of postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Minas Geraes {{arrival in}} Brazil, the country's {{prosperity}} began <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> and a severe depression hit the Brazilian economy.

25|$|The Vanir are attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from earlier}} traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. The Vanir are only attested in these Old Norse sources. Vanir is sometimes anglicized <b>to</b> <b>Wanes</b> (singular Wane).|$|R
50|$|The term Vanatrú is coined after Ásatrú, {{implying}} a {{focus on}} the Wanes (or Vanir; a second tribe of gods in Germanic paganism) rather than the Anses.

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began <b>to</b> <b>wane.</b> Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E
5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during the primary, and after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disappointment}} {{of the previous}} season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; {{in one of the}} closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.|$|E

50|$|Bouma cycles {{begin with}} an erosional contact of a coarse lower bed of pebble to granule {{conglomerate}} in a sandy matrix, and grade up through coarse then medium plane parallel sandstone; through cross-bedded sandstone; rippled cross-bedded sand/silty sand, and finally laminar siltstone and shale. This vertical succession of sedimentary structures, bedding, and changing lithology is representative of strong <b>to</b> <b>waning</b> flow regime currents and their corresponding sedimentation.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of her debut studio album, Breaking Night (1989), La India went on to produce When the Night is Over (1991), a {{collaboration}} between her then-husband Little Louie Vega and Marc Anthony. Both albums were recorded {{at the time when}} freestyle music's popularity was beginning <b>to</b> <b>wane,</b> and neither was a commercial success. India and Vega left Atlantic Records, as India wanted to pursue her singing career performing in Spanish. Three years later, American musician Eddie Palmieri, who had heard her singing on the radio, wrote and produced India's first Spanish-language record titled Llegó la India, via Eddie Palmieri (1992). Although it was a commercial success, her high-pitched vocals were criticized.|$|E

However, his own form began <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> and he was dropped from the team mid-way through the season. In 1948–49, Harvey remained outside the first-choice team, and played in only two first-class matches against Tasmania when Victoria fielded a second-string team. He retired {{at the end of}} the season, having played only 22 first-class matches in an interrupted career. Harvey captained his state five times during the post-war phase of his career, standing in when regular captain Lindsay Hassett was away on national duty.|$|E
5|$|Ketèlbey's {{popularity}} began <b>to</b> <b>wane</b> {{during the}} Second World War and his originality also declined; {{many of his}} post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC. In 1949 {{he moved to the}} Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes, Bells Across the Meadows was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time and the last night of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death—the first time his music had been included in the festival's finale.|$|E
