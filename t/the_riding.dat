5|$|Federally, Dawson Creek {{is located}} in the Prince Georgeâ€”Peace River riding. <b>The</b> <b>riding</b> is {{represented}} in the Canadian House of Commons by Conservative Bob Zimmer. Bob Zimmer was elected to this seat in 2011 after Jay Hill retired. Before Hill, who was first elected in 1993, <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> was represented by Progressive Conservative Frank Oberle. Oberle served as its Member of Parliament for 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he had no}} {{interest}} in politics at first, Dawson ran in the 1935 election as a Social Credit candidate in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> of Little Bow, at the urging of a citizens' group. He defeated United Farmers of Alberta candidate and former speaker Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. Dawson was re-elected seven consecutive times and held his seat for twenty-eight years.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for the horses used in Vienna. Breeding became very selective, only {{allowing}} stallions that had proved themselves at <b>the</b> <b>Riding</b> School {{to stand at}} stud, and only breeding mares who had passed rigorous performance testing.|$|E
25|$|Riders {{take a seat}} {{in one of the}} 15 {{carriages}} which hold 2 riders each (for a {{total of}} 30 riders). There is no seat belt or restraint system on <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> only a cage to hold on to during <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> as when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is in operation, gravity will keep the rider in place. Once <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators give <b>the</b> all clear, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> begins to spin in a circle constantly picking up speed. It can take about 20 to 25 seconds for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> to reach its top speed and lift off of the ground. After <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> lifts off <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> keeps rising eventually coming to an almost-vertical position. A few seconds later, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> begins to descend back to <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>rides</b> braking system is activated and <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> comes to a complete stop by the time it reaches <b>the</b> ground. One <b>ride</b> cycle is about 1 minute and 53 seconds.|$|R
50|$|During the {{duration}} of <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> changes speeds. When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is fluctuating in its wavelike manner, the person will feel like <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is not going that fast. However, when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is almost over, the person will feel forces on their body, and get pushed toward {{the outside of the}} cars. This happens when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> starts lowering to the ground in a non-wavelike manner. When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> moves in this way, it acts like a Himalaya / Musik Express ride.|$|R
25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operator was {{not paying attention}} and started <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> without putting <b>the</b> restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators. One of the passengers stood up, trying to get <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operator's attention. Soon after this, one of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators realized what was going on, and stopped <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> same <b>ride</b> operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> went through <b>the</b> layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operated normally {{for the rest of}} the day.|$|R
5|$|Charles May {{was also}} the uncle of famed aviator and flying ace Wop May, the latter being a son of his brother, Alexander Esson May. Alexander May was a former mayor of Carberry, Manitoba, {{postmaster}} of Edmonton, {{as well as an}} unsuccessful Liberal Candidate in the Canadian federal election, 1917, in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> of Edmonton East.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West Gate. In 1533, Canterbury reacted with concern to the news of Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in Kent; repairs {{were made to the}} walls, guns and ammunition mobilised, and <b>the</b> <b>Riding</b> Gate was blocked up. Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2007, Liberal MP Stephen Owen {{announced}} he would resign his seat of Vancouver Quadra to accept a position at the University of British Columbia, his resignation effective July 27, 2007. Owen was replaced in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> by former BC Provincial Liberal MLA Joyce Murray, after a by-election on March 17, 2008.|$|E
50|$|Tidal Wave is a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{is located}} in the Movie District portion of <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>ride's</b> theme is related to a {{tropical}} environment featuring several palms and trees. The entrance to <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is next to The Riddler's Revenge which is near to JB's Smokehouse BBQ. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> is open from the spring season to late September. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> temporarily closes in early October for Magic Mountain's annual Fright Fest event; <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> line is used for a maze. During the winter months, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is closed to drain the water and clean <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> along with <b>the</b> splash area. The entrance to the Flash Pass is located at the right side exit of <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> has two large boats which seat a maximum of 20 riders. Both of the boats are typically used every day.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{destroyed}} part of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in 1949 and {{the structure}} required major repairs. Replacement timber for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was bought from the dismantled pier at Lowestoft and <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> re-opened in 1950. Fire again destroyed parts of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in 1957.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> guests proceed past an {{observation}} deck for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> and past <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> former gift shop where they arrive back in Chinatown.|$|R
5|$|On September 20, 2006 Liberal MP Joe Fontana (London North Centre) {{resigned}} {{to run in}} the London mayoralty election. Fontana was replaced in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> by Liberal Glen Pearson after a by-election on November 27, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's {{relationship}} with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas {{argued that there}} was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote. In 1908, Labour candidate Donald McNabb was elected in a Lethbridge by-election; <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> had previously been held by a Liberal. McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).|$|E
5|$|The {{separate}} Lieutenancy for <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> {{was established}} after the Restoration, and the ridings each had separate Quarter Sessions. For statistical purposes in the 19th century an East Riding of Yorkshire registration county was designated, {{consisting of the}} entirety of the Poor Law Unions of Beverley, Bridlington, Driffield, Howden, Hull, Patrington, Pocklington, Sculcoates, Skirlaugh and York.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{operator}} {{is located}} in the center of <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> Part of <b>the</b> operator's duty is to control lighting and music in addition to <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> itself. Some variants include closed-circuit television cameras, allowing waiting riders and passersby to observe <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in action.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> {{was first}} opened during the 2003 season, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> {{attracted}} lots of guest and {{had almost no}} problems. As of {{the last couple of}} years, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> has been hampered with so many problems that it has been almost impossible to say when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> would be open. Canada's Wonderland has not stated exactly what is causing all the problems with <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 2012 and 2014, Slammer at Thorpe Park {{went through}} major downtime. All signage for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was removed {{at the end}} of 2012 which gave the {{impression}} that Thorpe Park weren't planning to open <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> anytime soon. For Fright Nights in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was completely removed from the actual park map which suggested <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> was going to close. However, {{at the start of the}} 2014 season, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> could be seen testing with sand filled dummies which suggested <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> would open again.|$|R
5|$|The two-story {{interior}} {{space on the}} first floor was originally used for carriages and then for automobiles, and now is used as an indoor exercising ring for the horses occupying the stalls below. In the end pavilions, there is a reception area, tack room, and small apartment designed to be occupied by <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> instructor.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than a dozen golf clubs in <b>the</b> <b>Riding</b> {{including}} the cliff-top course at Flamborough. The Royal Yorkshire Yacht Club is based at Bridlington, and flying and gliding take place from Pocklington airfield and Eddsfield airfield.|$|E
5|$|Cross ran as a Liberal in the 1925 federal {{election}} in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> of Athabaska, and defeated Donald Ferdinand Kellner, the Progressive incumbent from Edmonton East. Stewart, {{who had also}} left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent Edmonton West. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross sat in the Canadian House of Commons throughout the King-Byng Affair. In the ensuing 1926 election, Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner. Charles Wilson Cross {{died of a heart}} attack June 2, 1928, in Calgary.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> up to {{two people}} sit in one of 20 gondolas {{arranged}} in a circle, one in front of <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> moves clockwise, dispelling a slight amount of centrifugal force. A hydraulically powered arm underneath <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> then raises and tilts the frame so that <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is rotating at 87Â° from the horizontal, transforming <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> from a horizontal experience to a nearly vertical one.|$|R
5000|$|On March 16, 2012, around 1:00 pm, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> malfunctioned, {{causing it}} to freeze in <b>the</b> air. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> held 12 people, {{all of which were}} okay. It took ride {{developers}} about 15-20 minutes until they were able unfreeze <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> bringing all passengers safely down. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> passengers included four children and 8 adults. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> continued to occasionally freeze in air throughout the first week of operation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> park's dark <b>ride,</b> [...] "The Haunted House", {{was built}} by Bill Tracy in 1964 as a 1-level {{attraction}} on a lot facing the boardwalk strip. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was later expanded on when nearby Playland Park closed, leaving their own Tracy dark ride, [...] "Ghost Ship", up for grabs. Trimper's incorporated the tricks from <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> by adding a second level to <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> making it twice as long. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was originally believed to have opened in 1962, but after the recent discovery of correspondence linked to <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> its actual opening year was discovered to be two years later. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{was said to be}} Granville Trimper's favorite.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these large tracts of land into private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which continued to exist in <b>the</b> <b>Riding</b> until the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|One day later, on February 22, veteran Liberal MP {{and former}} Liberal Party of Canada interim leader Bill Graham {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection in the next federal election. On June 19, 2007, Graham announced he would be resigning his Toronto Centre seat effective July 2, 2007, to allow former Ontario New Democratic Party Premier and Liberal Party leadership candidate Bob Rae to run in <b>the</b> <b>riding.</b> Rae {{went on to win the}} Liberal stronghold riding in a March 17, 2008 byelection.|$|E
5|$|The Theatre Royal, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences {{from around the country}} to see its veteran star, Berwick Kaler. The Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to <b>the</b> <b>Riding</b> Lights Theatre Company, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances.|$|E
25|$|Starfish â€“ A {{circular}} Chance Trabant ride {{located near}} Ski Stadium. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was removed after two accidents sent {{people to the}} hospital after being thrown from <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> area is now <b>the</b> Air Penguins <b>ride</b> in Seaside Junction.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{has been}} used in {{television}} shows and advertisements. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was featured in a Specsavers advertisement when two elderly people <b>rode</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> after mistaking <b>the</b> train for a park bench.|$|R
500|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> {{opening it}} had several {{modifications}} and renovations, which included reprofiling parts of <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> shortening <b>the</b> seven-car trains to six-car trains, and performing maintenance {{on the wooden}} track. Six Flags Over Texas performed over [...] of trackwork on <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in <b>the</b> 2008â€“2009 offseason, with the ultimate aim of improving <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> smoothness. Although <b>the</b> maintenance did improve <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> park officials needed a more permanent solution. Initial speculation indicated <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> would be removed entirely from the park; however, Six Flags Over Texas denied any intention or consideration to do so. In March 2009, the park announced the closure of Texas Giant prior to a $10 million renovation. Following Fright Fest for that year, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> closed on November 1, 2009.|$|R
5|$|The {{economy is}} mainly based on {{agriculture}} and this, along with tourism, {{has contributed to}} the rural and seaside character of <b>the</b> <b>Riding.</b> These aspects are also reflected in the places of interest to visitors and major landmarks, which include historic buildings, nature reserves and the Yorkshire Wolds Way long-distance footpath. The open and maritime aspects and lack of major urban developments have also led to the county being allocated relatively high targets for the generation of energy from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{results for}} the race showed MacDowall won big {{in most of the}} polls, winning four out of five. Porter's support was concentrated in The Ridge where he won his only poll. MacDowall swept {{the south end of the}} district winning a shut out in the MÃ©tis communities of Duck Lake and St. Laurent de Grandin. Along with the shut out he held strong support in the rest of <b>the</b> <b>riding,</b> with his biggest single vote tally of votes coming form within the town of Prince Albert.|$|E
5|$|A {{county council}} for the East Riding of Yorkshire {{was set up}} in 1889, {{covering}} an administrative county which did not cover the county borough of Hull, but otherwise had the same boundaries as the historic riding. Both the administrative county and the historic Lieutenancy were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974, with most of <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> going to form the northern part of Humberside. The creation of this cross-Humber authority was unpopular and this culminated in the local government review in the 1990s, which saw Humberside abolished and the northern part form two unitary authorities. The East Riding district was formed on 1 April 1996. The ceremonial county, the area in which the Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire represents the Crown, was re-established the same day, covering Hull as well as the district.|$|E
5000|$|Riders {{take a seat}} in one {{of twelve}} {{carriages}} laid out to form a perfect circle {{around the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> Each carriage holds four people. There is no seat belt or restraint system on <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> only a cage to hold on to while <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is in motion. As <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> reaches full speed, gravity keeps the riders in place even when <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> is on a 90-degree angle. It takes about 16 seconds for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> to reach full speed before [...] "launching" [...] off the ground and takes just over 30 seconds to get into a vertical position (90-degree angle). <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> remains in <b>the</b> vertical position for about 10 - 15 seconds before returning down into the loading (horizontal) position.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> is {{surrounded}} by buildings resembling a traditional Arabic market town, while <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> itself is built into a pit. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was re-branded with a new colour scheme and logo in 2000.|$|R
5|$|The {{opening of}} <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> at Universal Studios Hollywood was an {{immediate}} success, with record attendance over the Memorial Day weekend. A 15 percent rise in attendance in 2012 was attributed to <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> opening. Within days of <b>the</b> <b>ride's</b> opening executives decided to install <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> at Universal Studios Florida with construction beginning almost immediately.|$|R
