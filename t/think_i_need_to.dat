The moment you expect something, you never get it.|$|R

Do not give way to them, my boy. Above all, set your face against what is the curse of our times: over-indulgence in wine. It is the ruin of thousands. Do not think it is manly to be vicious because you see others are. Always live, if you can, so that if you kept a true diary you could hand it to me to read without a blush on your cheek; and always bear in mind, that though I shall not be there to see you, a higher and purer eye will be upon you. You will try; won't you, Ralph?" ...|$|E

[...] Berenyi said, [...] "We started by writing crappy riot grrl anthems... which was probably charming in a juvenile way.

5000|$|.....we {{have arrived}} at the {{conclusion}} that these jets may, they may, be erupting from pockets of liquid water near, {{under the surface of}} Enceladus.

And I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our Solar system, whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere, would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
