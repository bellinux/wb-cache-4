25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird).

The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E
25|$|The size {{of ships}} visiting in the Finnish {{harbours}} had grown {{by the end}} of the 19th century, and in order to be able to dock those ships, the dock had to be extended. In 1903 the dock was extended to 96 metres, in 1910 to 100.6 metres and in 1912 to 106.7 metres. After the last enlargement, the company was able to dock the largest ships which visited <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Finnish harbours. As the dry dock alone was not enough to meet the demand, the company considered building another similar one or a floating dry dock. The first option was ruled out due to cost reasons, and the second one due to lack of suitable place next to the area. Therefore the company ended up to replace an 1886-built cradle by a larger one with 1,500 tonnes capacity. The 1907–1908 built new cradle was a significant investment, costing nearly 350,000 marks. Ship repair capabilities were further enhanced by introduction of welding in 1906 and investments on machinery, including two large lathes in 1908.|$|E
