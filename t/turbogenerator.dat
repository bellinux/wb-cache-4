The Kharkhovskii <b>Turbogenerator</b> Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941.

The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of these programs were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated water reserve tank, hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the rotational momentum of the <b>turbogenerator</b> rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E

After the Selby Coalfield was discovered in 1967 the Board would build three large power stations to use its coal. These were an expansion of the station at Ferrybridge, a new station at Eggborough, and the biggest at Drax.|$|E

2500|$|The turbine {{generator}} {{consists of a}} series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator.

The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and [...] long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced.
