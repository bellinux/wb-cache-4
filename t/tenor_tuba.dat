5|$|A {{comparable}} chamber {{work for}} an even more unusual set of instruments, the Capriccio for piano left hand, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and <b>tenor</b> <b>tuba,</b> was written for pianist Otakar Hollmann, who lost {{the use of his}} right hand during World War I. After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world.|$|E
25|$|In all {{of these}} cases, the composer's desired effect was that of tenor-voiced, valved brass {{instrument}} – and {{in many of these}} cases the euphonium is substituted for the called-for instrument, either because the instrument is obsolete (French C tuba), is unavailable (<b>tenor</b> <b>tuba),</b> or may be undesirable (Wagner tuba).|$|E
25|$|The {{euphonium}} is not traditionally an orchestral {{instrument and}} has not been common in symphony orchestras. However, there are a few works from the late Romantic period, in which composers wrote a part for <b>tenor</b> <b>tuba,</b> all of which are played on the euphonium: most notably Gustav Holst's Planets Suite and Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss. In addition, the euphonium is sometimes used in older orchestral works as a replacement for its predecessors, such as the ophicleide, or, less correctly, the bass trumpet or the Wagner tuba, both of which are significantly different instruments, and still in use today.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{source of}} confusion {{is that the}} instruments are invariably designated in orchestral scores simply as tubas, sometimes leaving it unclear whether the score means true bass tubas or Wagner tubas. (For example, orchestras sometimes assume the two <b>tenor</b> <b>tubas</b> in Janáček's Sinfonietta are Wagner tubas when the score means euphoniums).|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{deficiencies}} of the ophicleide {{gave rise to}} both the euphonium and the tuba in the mid-nineteenth century, the tuba has long since been accepted as an orchestral instrument, while the euphonium never has been. [...] Though the euphonium was embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have generally not taken advantage of its capabilities. [...] Nevertheless, there are several orchestral works, a few {{of which are in}} the standard repertoire, in which composers have called for a <b>tenor</b> <b>tuba,</b> a German Tenorhorn¹, a Wagner tuba, or a French tuba in C.|$|E
50|$|Instruments: Threefold woodwind (flutes, oboes, B flat clarinets, bassoons); brass: 8 horns in F (7th/8th also in B flat; horns 4-8 {{alternate}} with Wagner tubas: 2 <b>tenor</b> <b>tubas</b> in B {{flat and}} 2 bass tubas in F), 3 trumpets in F, alto, tenor and bass trombones, contrabass tuba; timpani; strings (violin I / II, viola, cello, double-bass).|$|R
50|$|Richard Wagner (1813-1883) contributed {{greatly to}} the {{advancement}} of winds in the orchestra, which inevitably advanced the growth of wind bands. Wagner utilized brass in new ways, even prompting the development of new instruments such as the <b>tenor</b> <b>tubas</b> ("Wagner tubas") and the slide contrabass trombone. One of his greatest contributions to the repertoire was his Trauermusik, composed in 1844 for winds.|$|R

2500|$|Ferdinand Sommer's {{original}} {{name for}} the instrument was the euphonion. It is sometimes called the <b>tenor</b> <b>tuba</b> in B, although this can also refer to other varieties of tuba. Names in other languages, as included in scores, can be ambiguous as well. They include French basse, saxhorn basse, and tuba basse; German Baryton, Tenorbass, and Tenorbasshorn; Italian baritono, bombardino, eufonio, and flicorno basso. The most common German name, Baryton, may also have caused the American {{use of the term}} [...] "baritone" [...] for the instrument with the influx of German musicians to the United States in the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Chief {{among these}} {{examples}} are the tone poems Don Quixote (1897) and Ein Heldenleben (1898) by Richard Strauss, which were originally scored for Wagner tuba, but after their performance on Wagner tuba proved unsatisfactory, were rescored for euphonium with Strauss's approval. [...] In the first {{movement of his}} Seventh Symphony (1906), Gustav Mahler wrote an extremely prominent solo for Tenorhorn¹. [...] Gustav Holst used a <b>tenor</b> <b>tuba</b> in three movements (Mars, Jupiter, and Uranus) of his suite The Planets (1914–16). Finally, [...] Leoš Janáček's most famous piece Sinfonietta employs two euphonium parts. Another popular piece by Janáček, Capriccio, employs a prominent euphonium part throughout. [...] Today, all of these parts are customarily played on euphonium, and {{in each of these}} cases, the instrument called for is used in both a soloistic role and written to function as part of the brass section.|$|E
