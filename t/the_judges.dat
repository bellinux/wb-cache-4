50|$|In serious {{criminal}} cases (such as murder) appearing before the High Court, two assessors may be appointed to assist <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> Assessors are usually advocates or retired magistrates. They sit with <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> during <b>the</b> court case {{and listen to}} all the evidence presented to the court. At {{the end of the}} court case they give <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> their opinion. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> does not have to listen to the assessors' opinions but it usually helps <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> to make a decision. The assessors may also only make decisions on facts, not on the law, which is solely the authority of <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b>|$|R

5|$|World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by judges and {{attendees}} of the World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees {{of the current}} and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, with the two most-nominated selected, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors, {{as well as other}} fantasy professionals and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties if <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> are deadlocked. The awards administration is a subgroup of the World Fantasy Convention Board, which selects sites for upcoming World Fantasy Conventions. Both the board and <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> panel are largely made up of professionals in the field of fantasy. <b>The</b> <b>judges</b> for the 2014 awards, for example, were authors Andy Duncan, Kij Johnson, Oliver Johnson, and Liz Williams, and editor John Klima.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> is considered a short-barreled shotgun under California state law, which has a broader definition of [...] "short-barreled shotgun," [...] and <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> is thus illegal to possess in that state.|$|R

5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
