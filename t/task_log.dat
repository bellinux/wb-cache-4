40|$|A sensor {{taken by}} itself, with no {{indication}} {{of what it is}} sensing, with what unit of measurement and where, would keep working without anybody being able to interpret its output. The sensor needs to be "contextualised". In this thesis we propose a sensor data modeling based on the Linked Data principles. We support its uptake by releasing LD 4 Sensors, a Web application that facilitates manual (GUI) and automated (REST API) sensor annotation, storage and retrieval using our data model. A side gain of this approach consists of automating the (currently manual) setup of several sensor settings, which will be presented in a demonstrative application and architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of using our data model to improve sensor relevancy and enrich Web data, within two different applications. First, we use our data model to improve the relevancy prediction of sensors during Daily Activity <b>Logging</b> <b>tasks.</b> Currently, <b>Task</b> <b>Logging</b> is performed by classifying the previously collected sensor readings in order to identify which task/s they were measuring. This approach has two downsides. First, the task identification happens after all the data has been recorded. Second, selecting which of the available sensors to query is difficult. Usually, sensors are selected according to their energy consumption or location. However, a more fine-grained selection would improve the system efficiency by reducing the amount of data to record an process while at the same time, saving energy. As the amount of Internet-connected objects increases and as we move towards ubiquitous computing web, the selection of on-demand information sources has become a significant requirement. In this thesis, I demonstrate that using our model based on Semantic Technologies and Distributional Semantic techniques we can identify which sensors to use during <b>Task</b> <b>Logging</b> while predicting the task being sensed in real-time. I compare my results with the other state-of-the-art <b>Task</b> <b>Logging</b> techniques showing the improvement. Second, we use our data model to enrich Web content in order to bridge the traditional Web and the Sensor Web. Traditional Web content is long-lived, as it most of the times lacks of real-time information. Sensors deployed pervasively throughout Smart Cities have the potential to be the source of such real-time information. However, querying all the sensor data sources is costly for they are distributed and live streaming high volumes of data. We realised the G-Sensing application that, as a Mozilla Firefox add-on, displays sensors data related to Google search results that represent real places. We demonstrate the feasibility and extensibility of our approach and the advantages it brings to the final user...|$|R

This is surprising as one would have expected that, after some 30 years of research commercial applications of interactive design or manufacturing planning and analysis would be widespread throughout the product design domain.

40|$|International audienceAlthough a broad {{literature}} exists {{concerning the}} development of conceptual understanding of force and other topics within mechanics, {{little is known about}} the role and development of students' talk about the subject. The paper presents an in-depth investigation of students' talk whilst being introduced to the concept of force. The main research goal was to investigate and understand how students develop an understanding of the concept of force and how they use and understand the term 'force'. Therefore we make relation to the research ﬁeld of students' preconceptions and the ﬁeld of second language learning. Two classes of N= 47 students were video-taped during a time period of nine lessons, each transcribed and analysed using a category system. Additional data was obtained via written <b>tasks,</b> <b>logs</b> kept by the students, and tests. The detailed analysis of the talk and the results of the tests indicate that students are facing difﬁculties in using the term 'force' scientiﬁcally similar to those in a foreign language instruction. Vygotsky (1962) already recognised a relationship between learning in science and learning a language. In this paper important aspects of this relationship are discussed based upon empirical data. We conclude that in some respects it might be useful to make reference to the research related to language learning when thinking about improving science education. In particular, according to Selinker's concept of interlanguage describing language learning processes within language instruction (Selinker, 1972), the language used by the students during physics lessons can be viewed as a 'scientiﬁc interlanguage'...|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 3, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 52 - 53) JIRA is a bug, issue and project tracking software developed by Atlassian Software Systems. JIRA is very popular, being used in over 11, 500 software development and research organizations worldwide. JIRA is used by software developers and managers to track tasks and bug fixes. A JIRA installation provides a web-based system where users may log on to create <b>tasks,</b> assign <b>tasks,</b> <b>log</b> work and comment on tasks, vote for new features and so on. However a perceived limitation is that only one issue can be updated at a time. The user also has to visit a separate web page to perform each function like editing the task, progressing the task along pre-defined workflows, editing the task, etc. While this may be acceptable for junior developers who may work on {{just one or two}} tasks at a time, the complexity fairly explodes in the case of project managers and other administrators who may be tracking scores or hundreds of tasks at a time. The time spent in visiting many web pages to update a single task, and then repeating the process for every task that needs attention, simply becomes too much of a hassle. To address this perceived shortcoming, we propose a desktop client to JIRA that allows concurrent access to many tasks at the same time. A two-dimensional grid view allows simultaneous access to all the desired attributes of a group of tasks. The time saved and the ease of updating many tasks at one go improves the productivity of each user and by enabling comparative editing, reduces the error rate. All this translates into huge savings for the enterprise. The design is kept as intuitive and close to the original JIRA design as possible, in order to flatten out the learning curve for users...|$|R

40|$|Performing {{everyday}} manipulation tasks successfully {{depends on}} the ability of autonomous robots to appropriately account for the physical behavior of task-related objects. Meaning that robots have to predict and consider the physical effects of their possible actions to take. In this work we investigate a simulation-based approach to naive physics temporal projection in the context of autonomous robot everyday manipulation. We identify the abstractions underlying typical first-order axiomatizations as the key obstacles for making valid naive physics predictions. We propose that temporal projection for naive physics problems should not be performed based on abstractions but rather based on detailed physical simulations. This idea is realized as a temporal projection system for autonomous manipulation robots that translates naive physics problems into parametrized physical simulation <b>tasks,</b> that <b>logs</b> the data structures and states traversed in simulation, and translates the logged data back into symbolic time-interval-based first-order representations.

It is commonly found that distributions that seem to be log normal over a broad range (say to the 95 th percentile of a population) change to an inverse fractional power (Pareto) distribution for the last few percentile. Annual income distributions are examples with this structure. The very wealthy generally achieve their superwealth through amplification processes that are not available to most.
