5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey {{on the morning of}} July 2, 1881.|$|E

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E

The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E

When Polk arrived in Washington, D.C. he roomed in Benjamin Burch's boarding house with some other Tennessee representatives, including Sam Houston. Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> elected by the popular vote.

500|$|His first {{incursion}} {{into the}} legislative realm occurred {{shortly after he}} assumed office, during the Senate debates over titles {{for the president and}} executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length.

500|$|The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, {{was not as}} {{aggressive}} in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. [...] It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> impeached. [...] Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore, next in line to the presidency {{in the absence of}} a vice president. [...] Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital. Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. [...] Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.|$|E

Adams played {{an active role in the}} Senate's deliberations, particularly during his first term. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently lectured the body on procedural and policy matters. At the start of Washington's presidency, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government.

2500|$|The {{issue of}} whether the President has power to speak up {{publicly}} on issues {{that he may have}} with the Government without Cabinet approval surfaced during the 2011 presidential election.

Similarly, another candidate, Tan Jee Say, promised to be the [...] "conscience of the people" [...] and commented that for controversial issues such as the building of casinos the President's views should be taken into consideration and that he should be allowed to air them in public. Candidate Tan Cheng Bock expressed his opinion in a Facebook posting that read: [...] "he president must be seen not as a figurehead but as somebody the people can look to for support for some of the issues, national problems and so on....

2500|$|Walton {{also played}} a {{significant}} role in choosing the location for Kennedy's burial. While many in the media, Kennedy's family, and the Kennedy administration believed that Kennedy would be buried in the family plot in Brookline, Massachusetts, Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert McNamara believed he should be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In a driving rain, McNamara visited the site early in the morning on Saturday, November 24. After reviewing three sites (one of which was the lawn below Arlington House) with cemetery superintendent John C. Metzler, Sr., McNamara returned around mid-morning with Robert Kennedy, Kennedy's sisters Jean Smith and Pat Lawford, and Walton. After reviewing all three sites, the group agreed on the Arlington House lawn. Walton was one of the first to speak in favor of the lawn site, and pointed to a site higher up the hill where he thought the grave should be. During a third trip that afternoon, McNamara and Walton accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to the site. Walton again pointed to where <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> buried, and others noted that Walton had instinctively chosen a plot along the axis between Arlington House and the Lincoln Memorial. Walton's reckoning was so good, his preferred site was only [...] off the axis line.|$|E

60|$|But how am I {{to excuse}} the Constitution on those points {{as to which}} it has, as I have said, fallen through, in respect to which it has shown itself to be inefficient by the {{weakness}} of its own words? Seeing that all the executive power is intrusted to the President, it is especially necessary that the choice of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> guarded by constitutional enactments; that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> chosen {{in such a manner}} as may seem best to the concentrated wisdom of the country. The President is placed in his seat for four years. For that term he is irremovable. He acts without any majority in either of the legislative houses. He must state reasons for his conduct, but he is not responsible for those reasons. His own judgment is his sole guide. No desire of the people can turn him out; nor need he fear any clamor from the press. If an officer so high in power be needed, at any rate the choice of such an officer should be made with the greatest care. The Constitution has decreed how such care should be exercised, but the Constitution {{has not been able to}} maintain its own decree. The constituted electors of the President have become a mere name; and that officer is chosen by popular election, in opposition to the intention of those who framed the Constitution. The effect of this may be seen in the characters of the men so chosen. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, the two Adamses, and Jackson were the owners of names that have become known in history. They were men who have left their marks behind them. Those in Europe who have read of anything, have read of them. Americans, whether as Republicans they admire Washington and the Adamses, or as Democrats hold by Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson, do not at any rate blush for their old Presidents. But who has heard of Polk, of Pierce, of Buchanan? What American is proud of them? In the old days the name of a future President might be surmised. He would probably be a man honored in the nation; but who now can make a guess as to the next President? In one respect a guess may be made with some safety. The next President will be a man whose name has as yet offended no one by its prominence. But one requisite is essential for a President; he must be a man whom none as yet have delighted to honor.|$|E
