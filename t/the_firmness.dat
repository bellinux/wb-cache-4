5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test <b>the</b> <b>firmness</b> of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test <b>the</b> <b>firmness.</b>|$|E

25|$|Corsets {{are held}} {{together}} by lacing, usually (though not always) at the back. Tightening or loosening the lacing produces corresponding changes in <b>the</b> <b>firmness</b> of the corset. Depending on the desired effect and time period, corsets can be laced from the top down, from the bottom up, or both {{up from the bottom}} and down from the top, using two laces that meet in the middle. In the Victorian heyday of corsets, a well-to-do woman's corset laces would be tightened by her maid, and a gentleman's by his valet. However, Victorian corsets also had a buttoned or hooked front opening called a busk. If the corset was worn loosely, it was possible to leave the lacing as adjusted and take the corset on and off using the front opening. (If the corset is worn snugly, this method will damage the busk if the lacing is not significantly loosened beforehand). Self-lacing is very difficult with tightlacing - also called waist training - which strives for the utmost possible reduction of the waist. The type of corset and bodice lacing became a refined mark of class; women who could not afford servants often wore front-laced bodices.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Xylanase {{activity}} in Namwa banana pulp was measured {{at different stages}} of ripening determined as <b>the</b> texture <b>firmness.</b> <b>The</b> maximum specific activity of crude enzyme was found to be 0. 66 unit/mg protein at <b>the</b> texture <b>firmness</b> of 210 cN and xylanase from this stage of ripening was purified. Purification of xylanase was achieved through precipitation with 80 % saturated ammonium sulfate followed by consecutive chromatography of CM-cellulose and Sephadex G- 50 columns. The purification was 14. 7 fold and the purified enzyme showed no cellulase activity. The enzyme separated by SDS-PAGE showed a single band with the estimated molecular mass of 19 kDa which was close to the 21 kDa as estimated by Sephadex G- 50. The enzyme had a broad range of pH and temperature optima of 5. 0 - 5. 5 and 45 °C- 50 °C, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Fruit {{firmness}} {{constitutes an}} important textural property {{and is one}} of the key parameters for estimating ripening and shelf life, which has a major impact on commercialization. In order to decipher the mechanisms related to firmness of apples (Malus × domestica Borkh.), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) was used to compare the total proteome of high and low firmness phenotypes from apple hypanthia of a 'Golden Delicious' × 'Dietrich' population. A total of 36 differentially regulated protein spots were positively identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and then validated against the Malus expressed sequence tags (EST) database. The findings of this study indicated a lower expression of ethylene biosynthesis related proteins in <b>the</b> high <b>firmness</b> phenotype, which could be linked to the slowing down of the ripening and softening processes. The reduced accumulation of proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis juxtaposed to the upregulation of a transposase and a GTP-binding protein in <b>the</b> high <b>firmness</b> phenotype. <b>The</b> results also showed higher expression of cytoskeleton proteins in <b>the</b> high <b>firmness</b> phenotype compared to <b>the</b> low <b>firmness</b> phenotype, which play a role in maintaining cell structure and possibly fruit integrity. Finally, a number of proteins involved in detoxification and defense were expressed in fruit hypanthium. This proteomic study provides a contribution towards a better understanding of regulatory networks involved in fruit hypanthium firmness and/or softening, which could be instrumental in the development of improved fruit quality. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

2500|$|To block balls that {{a pitcher}} throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that {{are said to}} be [...] "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself {{directly}} {{in the path of the}} ball. Once in position, he drops to his knees, places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and leans forward to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to [...] "keep the ball in front of him" [...] than to make a catch with his mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, <b>the</b> <b>firmness</b> of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.|$|E
