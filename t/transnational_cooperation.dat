It presented the United States and Europe as engaged in a silent economic war, in which Europe appeared to be completely outclassed on all fronts: management techniques, technological tools, and research capacity. Servan-Schreiber saw in this thesis {{the potential for a}} seminal book. He fleshed it out with reading keys and concrete proposals for a counter-offensive. The result was his international best-seller Le Défi Américain ("The American Challenge", 1967). It sold 600,000 copies in France, unprecedented for a political essay, and was translated into 15 languages.

The characteristic of our study is that it comprises a six country comparison. We are able to show significant differences between the countries with respect to the degrees of person- as well as organization-oriented trust.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} dynamic {{development}} of <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> in the East Asia Pacific {{and its relation}} to the East Asian integration process. It is generally agreed that regional integration has become an irresistible global trend. Nevertheless, while regionalism has succeeded in establishing the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement, no theory is yet profound enough to promote an effective cooperation mechanism in the East Asia Pacific. In respond to that, this empirical thesis is dedicated to exploring the problems and prospects that help explain why East Asian integration is different from other regions, as well as whether or not <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation,</b> focusing on intensive economic interaction at the local level without heavy political commitment, can be an alternative path for region-building in the East Asia Pacific. This thesis is based on case studies and the comparative methodology. A fieldwork research based on in-depth interviews was designed for further data collection. The research started by tracing out the development of contemporary integration theories including regionalisation, regionalism, new regionalism, and open regionalism; and their application in East Asia. It then evaluated the conditions underlying the <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> for integration. The introduction in the first chapter lays out a basic framework for research and the main questions for analysis: what accounts for the establishment and transformation of <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> in the East Asia Pacific? In addition to that, to what extent can <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> contribute to regional integration in the East Asia Pacific? In order to build up a comprehensive understanding of <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> in the East Asia Pacific, three cases were selected for further study, including the Singapore-Johor-Riau Growth Triangle, the Tumen River Area Development Programme, and the Southern China Sub-regional Economic Zone. Since the Southern China Sub-regional Economic Zone was the most prosperous project among these three cases, it was significant to conduct fieldwork research in this area to get a full picture of how micro-regionalism, a policy-driven force, interacted with micro-regionalisation, a market-led, in a sub-regional economic zone. Moreover, what was the extent of these two forces in sub-regional cooperation and their interrelations with regional integration in East Asia? This research introduces EGPIB factors (Economic complementarity, Geographical proximity, Political commitment and Policy coordination, Infrastructure development, and Business networks), as well as the theories used to examine the transformation of the cases. This thesis can contribute {{to the understanding of the}} establishment and the development of the <b>transnational</b> sub-regional <b>cooperation</b> in the East Asia Pacific. It contends that, firstly, economic complementarity, among five factors, is the most important determinant for forming a sub-regional economic zone. Secondly, micro-regionalisation and micro-regionalism are both important in maintaining a growing sub-regional economic zone. However, they weight differently in the course of a sub-regional cooperation project. And thirdly, a sub-regional economic zone which closely follows the flying geese pattern is more likely to grow. ...|$|R

By promoting the favorable regime of <b>transnational</b> regional <b>cooperation,</b> both sides become more effective in managing such common problems as mutual security, political, economic and environmental challenges; illegal immigration; drug- and human-trafficking; etc. What is needed for the successful development of TRC in Eurasian context? What factors make a crucial impact {{on the development of}} regional cooperation, whether it is further "inclusion" or "exclusion" of the regions from cooperation with European neighbors? Is it the geopolitical location of the regions that makes regional cooperation more feasible or are there other factors that influence the success of this process? How might the regulatory and administrative tools of central government facilitate or complicate this process? To answer these questions, the study attempts to re-conceptualize the theories of integration, Europeanization, and regionalism. Then, it addresses the role of ethnicity, economical development, and geopolitical factors in the establishment and development of <b>transnational</b> regional <b>cooperation.</b> It also investigates the importance of "domestic-policy factors" (reforms in the federal governments) in the development of TRC.

40|$|The project {{addresses}} transnational corperations {{and their}} affairs regarding the Zambian copper mines after the privatization from 1997 - 2000. As {{we have had}} prejustices concerning the transnational corperations huge profit compared to the zambian state tax income on cobber, the project is drafted with a critical hermeneutic perspective. To understand the greater picture a selection of three different views on the issue have been chosen. The three perspectives include a liberalistic and marxistic economic point of view combined with Joseph Stiglitz’ theory as a critical mainstream economist. The positioning of the three perspectives greatly varies in a scale related context. The project is therefore formed throughout a dialectic point of view {{due to the fact}} that we analyze the issue in the different contexts to perceive a new and holistic understanding compared to our former view. The liberalistic analysis concludes that Zambia should have a positive perspective on the transnational corperations because of the economic growth it contributes. The marxistic analysis however sees the companies as a factor only amplifying the inequality between first and third world countries already present. Our middle perspective, Joseph Stiglitz, argues that the <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperations</b> investing in the zambian cobber mines can be an advantage under the conditions that national as well as international regulations og accounting rules are introduced. The three perspectives are then compared and discussed whether which from our point of view is the right decision for the Zambian government. Due to our dialectic approach and thereby achievement of new knowledge we can conclude that the situation is more complex than first assumed. Therefore is it not appropriate to postulate that transnational corporations have a purely negative influence. By contrary we now consider, based on our analyses and discussion, transnational corporations as a potential win for Zambia due to capital inflows and new technology. This however demands an accounting transparency from the <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperations</b> to avoid transfer mis-pricing. This is due to the low tax income the cobber provides for the Zambian government and therefore a national or international regulation on for example the transparency of accounting would greatly increase the Zambian income on cobber taxes. Furthermore a reduction or abolition of EU’s protective tariffs could provide Zambia with the opportunity of upscaling their industrial sector and thereby retain more parts of the value chain within theirs frontiers...|$|R
