5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain {{the basis for the}} modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong and {{damaging}} aftershocks persisted for about three-and-a-half months. The {{largest in the}} sequence came on May 8. The event caused additional destruction to the northeast of the initial meizoseismal area. Qatur, which had been nearly destroyed by the mainshock, took another serious hit. Other villages (Chaliyan, Givaran, Mir 'Umar, and Ravyan) also experienced major destruction. Shikaryazi was a village in the southeast region <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been seriously affected by the mainshock, but experienced heavy damage during the May 8 event. This shock resulted in four additional deaths.|$|E

5|$|After its release, The Complete Studio Albums (1983–2008) {{received}} mixed reception from reviewers, who complimented {{the overall}} packaging {{of the box}} set, but hoped that the record label would have included Madonna's other popular songs <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been on the original studio albums. The box set charted in multiple nations including Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. It entered the top-ten of the Japanese Oricon album chart. The same week, MDNA was also present in the top-ten, making Madonna the first female artist from a Western country to have two albums in the chart's top-ten.|$|E

Even before the discovery of its cause, the presence of the syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed.

5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, considered and rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking {{possession of the}} now-evacuated city of Athens. The Allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely, the Allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee {{the security of the}} Peloponnese. The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies, marking {{a turning point in the}} conflict.|$|E

With Orr, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1970 and 1972, and lost in the 1974 Final. In both victories, Orr scored the clinching goal and was named the playoff MVP. In the final achievement of his career, he was the MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup international hockey tournament. In 1976, Orr left Boston {{as a free agent}} to join the Black Hawks, but repeated injuries had effectively destroyed his left knee, and he retired in 1978 at age 30.|$|E

5|$|Lithuania regained its {{independence}} on February 16, 1918 {{and the old}} fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision.

In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of new military technologies, its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches were filled with scrap iron.|$|E

The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty. Matthias authorized his new vassal's son Stephen Tomašević to take possession of the parts of Serbia <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been occupied by the Ottomans.|$|E
