Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in {{the figure of a}} cross, but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.|$|E
25|$|For the repair, the CAIB {{determined}} that the astronauts would have to use tools and small pieces of titanium, or other metal, scavenged from the crew cabin. These metals would help protect the wing structure and would be held in place during re-entry by a water-filled bag that had turned into ice in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> space. The ice and metal would help restore wing leading edge geometry, preventing a turbulent airflow over the wing and therefore keeping heating and burn-through levels low enough for the crew to survive re-entry and bail out before landing. The CAIB could not determine whether a patched-up left wing would have survived even a modified re-entry, {{and concluded that the}} rescue option would have had a considerably higher chance of bringing Columbias crew back alive.|$|E

25|$|Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) are {{spare parts}} {{that can be}} readily {{replaced}} when a unit either passes its design life or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Many are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs) or share larger platforms called External Stowage Platforms which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> space require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections (LAN) and telemetry to connect experiments.

500|$|Andrée {{assured the}} {{audience}} that Arctic summer weather was uniquely suitable for ballooning. The midnight sun would enable observations round the clock, halving the voyage time required, and do away with all need for anchoring at night, which might otherwise be a dangerous business. Neither would the balloon's buoyancy be adversely affected by <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> night. The drag-rope steering technique was particularly well adapted for a region where the ground, consisting of ice, was [...] "low in friction and free of vegetation". He said that the minimal precipitation in the area posed no threat of weighing down the balloon. If some rain or snow did fall on the balloon, Andrée argued, [...] "precipitation at above-zero temperatures will melt, and precipitation at below-zero temperatures will blow off, for the balloon will be travelling more slowly than the wind." [...] The audience was convinced by these arguments, so disconnected were they from {{the realities of the}} Arctic summer storms, fogs, high humidity, and ever-present threat of ice formation. The academy approved Andrée's expense calculation of 130,800kronor in all, corresponding in today's money to just under a million U.S. dollars, of which the single largest sum, 36,000kronor, was for the balloon. With this endorsement, there was a rush to support his project, headed by King Oscar II, who personally contributed 30,000kronor, and Alfred Nobel, the dynamite magnate and founder of the Nobel Prize.|$|E

2500|$|ZEBs harvest {{available}} energy {{to meet their}} electricity and heating or cooling needs. In the case of individual houses, various microgeneration technologies {{may be used to}} provide heat and electricity to the building, [...] using solar cells or wind turbines for electricity, and biofuels or solar thermal collectors linked to a seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) for space heating. An STES can also be used for summer cooling by storing <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> winter underground. To cope with fluctuations in demand, zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the electricity grid, export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus, and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced. Other buildings may be fully autonomous.|$|E

The actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process. At its peak, a typical thunderstorm produces three or more strikes to the Earth per minute. Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses, resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere. However, it can also occur during dust storms, forest fires, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, and even in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>of</b> winter, where the lightning is known as thundersnow.
