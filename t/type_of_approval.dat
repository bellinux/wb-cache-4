40|$|BACKGROUND: The use {{of health}} data for public health, surveillance, quality {{improvement}} and research {{is crucial to}} improve health systems and health care. However, bodies responsible for privacy and ethics often limit access to routinely collected health data. Ethical approvals, issues around protecting privacy and data access are often dealt with by different layers of regulations, making approval processes appear disjointed. OBJECTIVE: To create a comprehensive framework for defining the ethical and privacy status of a project and for providing guidance on data access. METHOD: The framework comprises principles and related questions. The core of the framework will be built using standard terminology definitions such as ethics-related controlled vocabularies and regional directives. It is built in this way to reduce ambiguity between different definitions. The framework is extensible: principles can be retired or added to, as can their related questions. Responses to these questions should allow data processors to define ethical issues, privacy risk and other unintended consequences. RESULTS: The framework contains three steps: (1) identifying possible ethical and privacy principles relevant to the project; (2) providing ethics and privacy guidance questions that inform the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> needed; and (3) assessing case-specific ethics and privacy issues. The outputs from this process should inform whether the balance between public interests and privacy breach and any ethical considerations are tipped in favour of societal benefits. If they are then this should be the basis on which data access is permitted. Tightly linking ethical principles to governance and data access may help maintain public trust...|$|E

40|$|Europe is {{changing}} its regulation on the noise emitted by vehicles because the European community realized that noise levels on streets and in buildings {{are higher than}} expected. There are many possible reasons for this public health problem, among others: {{the growth of the}} vehicle fleet and the inefficiency of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> method. In response to this problem, the ISO 362 - 1 has been revised, and now vehicles are tested under less severe conditions but, {{in the light of the}} driving habits in the urban centres, experts say this new procedure is more realistic than the previous one. However, on critical analysis, one can find some points, such as the lack of importance given to the engine cooling system and the way in which urban buses are assessed in the same way as delivery trucks, among other points that may annul the effect of this new European proposal. Vehicle manufacturers hope that ISO 362 - 1 will be adopted by as many countries as possible around the world, in order to reduce development costs, but some weak points may make its acceptance by other countries ’ governments difficult. Many countries around the world are facing the same environmental problem faced by Europe, and they need to improve their legislation on vehicle noise control, but some experts are not fully convinced as to the environmental benefits of this new method and tend to adopt other methods, considered more effective, which can be a problem for vehicle manufacturers, due to the final costs of vehicles.

Below {{the picture is}} an explanation of how King got the determination and drive to become a track athlete who won three Southwest Conference championships and earned all-American honors. Caption reads: DARRYL “DOC” KING, ‘ 79 	In athletics as well as life, overcoming hurdles has presented Darryl “Doc” King with a challenge from which he could not walk away. 	“If you say I can’t do something, I’m going to prove to you that I can,” said King, a standout in the 110 -meter high hurdels at Rice from 1975 - 79. 	King has certainly proved many of his critics wrong en route to winning three consecutive Southwest Conference championships, earning all-America honors and becoming the first black track athlete ever to {{be inducted into the}} Rice Athletic Hall of Fame. 	King’s first, and perhaps toughest critic, was his father Robert. A hard-working man not prone to shower praise liberally, Robert King instilled in Darryl and his brother Derek a steely sense of determination. “He was tough taskmaster,” King remembers. “We never got the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> that we thought we deserved. Whatever we did, he always thought we could do better. ” 	King seemed destined to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his brother to Seton Hall University until, quite by accident, first-year assistant track coach Steve Straub came to visit on a winter afternoon in 1974. Straub had journeyed from Houston to Moorestown, N. J. to recruit another athlete when he learned of King’s potential from his high school coach. After a brief conversation, Straub offered him a scholarship and King, eager to get the best business education he could, readily accepted without ever visiting the Houston campus. 	The trip to Houston the following summer was the first time the 18 -year old King had ever been on an airplane. More than 2, 000 miles removed from friends and family, King felt isolated. He soon met former standout hurdler and Rice head coach (and current athletic director) Bobby May. While May, the 1964 NCAA champion in King’s event, was impressed with his new recruit, King was awed by his coach and surroundings. “I though I’ll never be able to measure up,” he remembered. 	A multi-sport star in high school, King had difficulty giving up football and basketball to concentrate solely on track. He joined the school’s intramural leagues, a fact which didn’t sit well with his coaches. The coaches were even more upset when they learned their prize hurdler had suffered a broken leg playing intramural football. He was ordered to stay away from the intramural playing fields. 	But King, never one to back down from a challenge, was back playing just a few weeks after having the cast removed from his leg. Straub noticed him one day and arranged a meeting with King and his father that would change the course of the hurdler’s career. 	“He was pretty tough on me,” King said of his dad’a words that fall weekend during his sophomore year. “After that I was determined to make my athletic career memorable. ” 	With a newfound sense of discipline and dedication King set out to leave his imprint on Rice track and field history. He stunned the field later that spring to win the first of his three consecutive Southwest Conference championships. The next year King was again an underdog at the conference meet despite being the defending champion. Again he proved the critics wrong, winning his second title. 	A fierce competitor who was at his best in the big meets, he repeated the feat as a senior and earned all-America honors after finishing fourth in the NCAA Championships in a field that included future Olymipians Renaldo NeHemiah and Greg Foster. His SWC winning time of 13 years later. 	King’s determination was equally evident in the classroom, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts in economics and managerial studies in just four years. 	After graduation, King turned his energies to coaching, spending two seasons as a assistant coach with the University of Arkansas before entering private business. Today, King works for Unisys Corporation in King of Prussia, Pa. and has begun a marketing service and consulting business known as King Enterprise. 	He was married in 1981 and he and wife Sheila have two children – Dara, six, and Danice, three. Rice Athletic Hall of Fam...|$|E

30|$|The two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> project <b>approval</b> {{procedures}} {{have much in}} common.

This means that all aspects of the projects were examined by different administration departments (such as the nature conservation authority, the water authority and the building authority) during the approval process. They also have a toleration effect. After the approval was granted, any demands to omit the project or to remove or modify the facilities are ruled out. The differences between the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> project <b>approval</b> procedures are, for example, that an authorisation process according to the Federal Immission Control Act has to be completed after seven resp. 3  months, whereas there is no strict time limit for planning permission procedures. They merely have to be completed “in a timely manner”. In planning permission procedures, the authorities regularly examine the necessity of the project.

We identify two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> processes and call them traditional and contemporary. The traditional process is shown to have certain advantages (projects are approved) and obvious deficiencies (poor evaluation of impacts). The contemporary process is discussed in detail and is shown to be flawed also.

The second limit: Contemporary project <b>approvals</b> require assessments <b>of</b> impacts with greater accuracy than we can provide with present technology. This is a the result of uncertainties in our data, models and computations. The third limit: Because of the uncertainties in our studies, modelling and design, project assessment becomes necessarily a combination of objective input (hard numbers) and subjective input (experience). Since the public and legal processes do not understand or have little tolerance for uncertainties and subjective decisions, projects can easily be delayed, postponed or cancelled, because it appears as if the project has not been studied sufficiently...|$|R
