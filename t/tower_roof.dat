[...] The church was given a grant by the Welsh Assembly Government of £20,570 in May 2004. This was to repair the leadwork, the rainwater goods, repointing and limewashing of the <b>tower</b> <b>roof</b> and the superstructure of the building. Another building in Penmon, the Priory House (which is set around the cloister court of the church), received £21,600. This was to repair the chimneys, the walls, the windows and the roof of the house.|$|E

The site was now unmanned, however, and had fallen into decay since the construction work by Tovey. The writer John Troutbeck, commenting {{at the end of}} the century, remarked on the tower having a [...] "special bomb proof" [...] roof, topped with [...] high parapets. He noted, that although there while still some old iron artillery guns present, the site was still ungarrisoned and in a state of disrepair.|$|E

500|$|The {{church has}} a plain, simple Decorated-style exterior, {{apart from the}} tower which is Early English style. The nave and chancel are in a single chamber, {{separated}} by a narrow step instead of a chancel arch. [...] The tower stands at {{the western end of}} the church, and contains a ring of four bells hung for change ringing. The tenor (largest) bell dates from 1908, the others from 1913; all were cast by John Taylor & Co. The church is built of rubble with ashlar dressings. The roof of the main body is tiled; during the 14thcentury it had a thatched roof, but this was replaced in about 1400. [...] The <b>tower</b> <b>roof</b> is a shingled octagonal cap.|$|E

2500|$|The Kanagawa Prefectural office {{competition}} specifications {{were for}} a building {{which had to}} be clearly visible, and identifiable from ships approaching the entrance of the harbour. The end result included definitive architectural features such as an eclectic Beaux-Arts and five-story pagoda styled high tower with a Japonesque Emperor's Crown styled roof. The use of scratched tiles were adopted from Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel, and the flowering motifs used throughout the building are based on the features of Byodō-in temple.The building's tower is referred to as [...] "King's Tower", and complements the domed temple-bell-shaped <b>tower</b> <b>roof</b> of the Yokohama Customs Building called [...] "Queen's Tower".

50|$|A passage {{connecting}} the tower with the mainland {{was built in}} 1806, and guns were installed on the <b>tower's</b> <b>roof</b> until 1862. It was subsequently used as a semaphore station, but it was eventually abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{no public}} access to the bellringers' chamber, the belfry or the <b>tower</b> <b>roof.</b> In the tower's bell chamber there are six bells, {{variously}} described as [...] "nicely-toned" [...] and [...] "richly-toned," [...] which have been hung for full circle ringing. They were cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1886. The name of the company, Mears and Stainbank, is cast into the bells, along {{with the names of}} Henry and Ellen Williams the donors, and their children. The diameters of the bells, from smallest to tenor, are: (1) Joshua 28.25in., (2) John 30.75in., (3) Annie 33.25in., (4) Mary 34.75in., (5) Ellen 37in. and (6) Henry 42.75in. The round is D#, C#, B, A#, G#, F#. The tenor bell weighs [...] In the bell chamber is a wooden frame consisting of two tiers of three bells each. 1, 3 and 5 hang above 2, 4 and 6, such that 1 is above 2; 3 is above 4; 5 is above 6, putting the heavier bells upon one side, that is, the west side. They are hung thus: [...] "each bell hangs from its original wooden headstock though a restoration has seen the fitting of independent crown staples and ball bearings. The third has an SG clapper whilst those of the others are wrought iron. Traditional stays and sliders." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reality in}} the bell-chamber {{is a very small}} and roughly-finished room, only {{partially}} protected from gales by louvred, unglazed windows on all sides. A massive and braced hardwood frame fills the room completely from west to east. The frame is over [...] high and is smooth and polished to the touch. On the south and north sides there are narrow squeeze spaces of about [...] between the frame and the wall. There is no aid to access {{to the top of the}} frame. The wheels of the top tier of bells project above the frame. The frame exactly fits the room, and the bells exactly fit the frame, but only because their wheels are arranged in different directions to allow fit. Access to the roof would require a slim and agile climber who would then climb a ladder, and from the ladder lift and slide with one hand a very heavy insulated trapdoor. The trapdoor is weatherproofed by being shaped to overhang the lips on which it is seated. The survival of the frame and consequently the safety of the bells depends on the condition of this trapdoor and the roof. It is likely that the tower's floors were installed after hanging the bells: the frame could then be built in place, the bells winched from the floor of the tower, and the floors would then be put in. Winching the bells up through the tower would require a massive beam across the <b>tower</b> <b>roof</b> to support the pulley; no such beam exists now.|$|E
