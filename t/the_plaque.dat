5|$|In 1939, {{the group}} E Clampus Vitus {{commissioned}} and dedicated a plaque commemorating Emperor Norton's {{call for the}} construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group's intention was that <b>the</b> <b>plaque</b> be placed on the newly opened San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge itself. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however; and, sometime shortly after World War II, <b>the</b> <b>plaque</b> was installed at the Cliff House. In the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>plaque</b> was moved to the Transbay Terminal.

5|$|After Rhodesia's {{reconstitution}} as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's government disowned {{many old}} monuments making {{reference to the}} fallen of the World Wars, including the Hull memorial at Shangani.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether {{in cases of}} variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), <b>the</b> florid-type <b>plaques</b> are derived from <b>the</b> diffuse <b>plaques</b> or whether <b>the</b> 2 <b>plaque</b> types develop independently. Material: Blocks of frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal neocortex and cerebellar cortex from 11 cases of vCJD. Method: The density, distribution and spatial pattern of the florid and diffuse plaques were determined in each brain region using spatial pattern analysis. Results: The density of <b>the</b> diffuse <b>plaques</b> was significantly {{greater than that of}} <b>the</b> florid <b>plaques</b> in most areas. The ratio of the diffuse to florid plaques varied between brain regions and was maximal in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The densities of the florid and diffuse plaques were positively correlated in the parietal cortex, occipital cortex, the inferior temporal gyrus and <b>the</b> dentate gyrus. <b>Plaque</b> densities were not related to disease duration. In the cerebral cortex, <b>the</b> diffuse <b>plaques</b> were more commonly evenly distributed or occurred in large clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia mater compared with <b>the</b> florid <b>plaques</b> which occurred more frequently in regularly distributed clusters. Conclusion: <b>The</b> florid <b>plaques</b> may not be derived from <b>the</b> diffuse <b>plaques,</b> <b>the</b> 2 <b>plaque</b> types appearing to develop independently with unique factors involved in their pathogenesis...|$|R

5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed <b>the</b> <b>plaque</b> attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, <b>the</b> <b>plaque</b> was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E

The seal can also be seen on the railway bridge at St John's Street.|$|E

5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of <b>the</b> <b>plaque,</b> which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
