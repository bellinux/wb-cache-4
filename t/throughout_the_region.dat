5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest.

Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E
