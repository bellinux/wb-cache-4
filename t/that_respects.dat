5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of graph theory, a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> their structure. More concretely, it {{is a function}} between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

25|$|The 'ASEAN Way' {{refers to}} a {{methodology}} or approach to solving issues <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> the cultural norms of Southeast Asia. Masilamani and Peterson summarise it as: A working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilize compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritizes a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view. Members avoid embarrassment {{that may lead to}} further conflict.|$|E
25|$|Some minarchists {{argue that}} a state is inevitable, thus believing anarchy to be futile. Minarchists justify the {{necessity}} of the state {{on the grounds that}} private defence agencies and courts could be biased by unevenly representing the interests of higher paying clients. Robert Nozick, who publicized the idea of a minimal state in Anarchy, State, and Utopia, argued that a night-watchman state provides a framework that allows for any political system <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> fundamental individual rights, and therefore morally justifies the existence of a State.|$|E
25|$|To {{become a}} member, a country {{must meet the}} Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen.

Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria {{is the responsibility of the}} European Council. No member state has yet left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.

25|$|Willow {{chooses to}} attend college with Buffy in Sunnydale {{although}} she is accepted to prestigious schools elsewhere. Her relationships with Buffy and Xander become strained {{as they try to}} find their place following high school. Willow becomes much more confident in college, finally finding a place <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> her intellect, while Buffy has difficulty in classes and Xander does not attend school. Willow's relationship with Oz continues until a female werewolf appears on the scene, aggressively pursuing him, and he leaves town to learn how to control the wolf within. She becomes depressed and explores magic more deeply, often with powerful but inconsistent results. She joins the campus Wicca group, meeting Tara Maclay, eventually falling in love with and choosing to be with her even when Oz returns to Sunnydale after apparently getting his lycanthropic tendencies under control.|$|E
25|$|As {{an attempt}} to correct some of the error due to a non-zero , the usage of local linear {{weighted}} regression with ABC to reduce the variance of the posterior estimates has been suggested. The method assigns weights to the parameters according to how well simulated summaries adhere to the observed ones and performs linear regression between the summaries and the weighted parameters {{in the vicinity of}} observed summaries. The obtained regression coefficients are used to correct sampled parameters in the direction of observed summaries. An improvement was suggested in the form of nonlinear regression using a feed-forward neural network model. However, {{it has been shown that}} the posterior distributions obtained with these approaches are not always consistent with the prior distribution, which did lead to a reformulation of the regression adjustment <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> the prior distribution.|$|E
25|$|All these {{regional}} {{varieties of}} the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called occitan larg (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> and admits soft regional adaptations (which {{are based on}} the convergence of previous regional koinés). So Occitan can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians, grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of diglossia, some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} a {{peaceful}} community of nations had been proposed {{as far back as}} 1795, when Immanuel Kant's [...] outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued {{for the establishment of a}} peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war. [...] This period also saw the development of international law, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. As historians William H. Harbaugh and Ronald E. Powaski point out, Theodore Roosevelt was the first American President to call for an international league.

Rating it {{four out of five}} stars, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy complimented the vocal mix on the album, adding that [...] "Cheek to Cheek may not be the glittering spectacle we've come to expect from Lady Gaga, but with Tony Bennett's guidance the pair have delivered an authentic and solid jazz record <b>that</b> <b>respects</b> the genre's generous history. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars and praised Gaga's vocals. Dolan felt the album [...] "proves she can be a sophisticated lady". Charles J. Gan from Associated Press also praised Bennett and Gaga's singing, writing that [...] "Had she been born in an earlier era, Gaga would have been right at home in an MGM musical". Idolator's Bianca Gracie described the album as [...] "a refreshing listen that highlights the undeniable talent of both Bennett and Gaga and how well they work together". Writing for the National Post, Mike Doherty observed that Gaga took [...] "liberties with the beat, bends notes, purrs and whoops away" [...] with the vocals, while Bennett was able to complement with his characteristic [...] "dapper approach".|$|E
