5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809). However, Johnson was still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> copies {{of it in the}} 1790s and consistently listed it in the advertisements for her other works.

The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley {{was found to have}} planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E

5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} {{kept him from}} military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les mêmes, which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E

5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist {{opinions}} had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{makes her}} way back to Ricardo, who {{explains}} that the Working Joes, the station's service androids, abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits. He also tells her that Samuels is attempting to interface with the station's controlling artificial intelligence, APOLLO, to cease the rampage. However, APOLLO's defensive countermeasures electrocute Samuels shortly after he managed to open a path for Ripley into APOLLO's control core. Upon reaching APOLLO, Ripley discovers that Seegson, who has been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> off Sevastopol for years, has finally found a buyer: Weyland-Yutani, who instructed APOLLO to protect the alien. When Ripley tells APOLLO that the creature is no longer aboard the station and demands to cease all activity, it refuses due to an unidentified presence within the station's reactor. Ripley arrives there and discovers that it has been converted into an alien nest. She then initiates a reactor purge to destroy the nest, but some aliens manage to escape and begin to overrun Sevastopol. Ripley learns from Ricardo that Taylor was sent by Weyland-Yutani to retrieve the alien, and that she freed Marlow in exchange for the location of LV-426. However, Marlow double-crosses her and takes her hostage aboard the Anesidora.|$|E
