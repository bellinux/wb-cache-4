5|$|Samarium-149 {{has high}} {{cross-section}} for neutron capture (41,000barns) {{and is therefore}} used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000barns, {{it is on the}} order of hundreds of barns for 150Sm, 152Sm, and 153Sm, and is 6,800barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium. Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after xenon-135.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Y Lyncis is {{a popular}} target among amateur astronomers, {{as it is a}} semiregular {{variable}} ranging in brightness from magnitude 6.2 to 8.9. These shifts in brightness are complex, with a shorter period of 110 days due to the star's pulsations, and a longer period of 1400 days possibly due to the star's rotation or regular cycles in its convection. A red supergiant, it has an estimated diameter around 580 times that of the Sun, is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive, and has a luminosity around 25,000 times that of the Sun. 1 Lyncis and UX Lyncis are red giants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> semiregular variables with complex fluctuations in brightness.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
