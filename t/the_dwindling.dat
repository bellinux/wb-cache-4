5|$|As many {{newspapers}} {{belonging to}} <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> Communist Party, Arbeideren would {{cease to exist}} {{before the end of}} the 1920s. It was still published six times a week, but had to give up its printing press in 1929, switching to Samtrykk in Oslo. The last ever issue of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad was published on 4 October 1929.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{many local}} {{businesses}} collapsed, several railroads went bankrupt, and numerous small rural banks folded. Manufacturing {{came to an}} abrupt halt or was severely cut back due <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> demand for products. The Depression continued to negatively affect Indiana until the buildup for World War II. The effects continued to be felt for many years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E

5|$|Conservation is also {{facilitated}} by the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG), an association of nearly 40zoos and related organizations, including the Duke Lemur Center, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and the Saint Louis Zoological Park. This international NGO supports Madagascar's Parc Ivoloina, helps protect Betampona Reserve and other protected areas, and promotes field research, breeding programs, conservation planning, and education in zoos. One of their major projects involved the release of captive black-and-white ruffed lemurs, designed to help restock <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> population within Betampona Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Brigade {{had just}} 33 tanks {{remaining}} after losing 20 tanks. This prompted Second Army command to transfer {{a battalion of}} 21 tanks on October 18 from the 2nd Infantry Division to the north to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> tank numbers in 16th Division's bridgehead. As the battalion moved south, {{a large number of}} Israeli aircraft attacked the formation, forcing it to undertake evasive maneuvers, turning eastwards and fanning out in the desert terrain, thereby avoiding losses. The battalion was then attached to the 21st Division.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{had contact}} with these societies, and {{established}} missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were {{the reasons for the}} eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Heraclius {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Turks, who took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> strength of the Persians to ravage their territories in the Caucasus. Late in 627, Heraclius launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia, where, despite the desertion of the Turkish contingent that had accompanied him, he defeated the Persians at the Battle of Nineveh. Continuing south along the Tigris, he sacked Khosrau's great palace at Dastagird and was only prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by {{the destruction of the}} bridges on the Nahrawan Canal. Khosrau was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavadh II, who at once sued for peace, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories.* GreatrexLieu (2002), II, 217227 Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dwindling</b> {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO to shift to the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The islands were officially the Kingdom of Hawaii but had {{generally}} {{been known as}} the Sandwich Islands since the 1778 visit of Captain James Cook. The estimated population of Native Hawaiians when Cook arrived was 800,000. With the arrival of whaling ships and missionaries in the early 19th century, the Native Hawaiians were exposed to diseases for which they had no immunity and began dying in large numbers. The official 1878 census showed only 44,088 individuals who claimed Hawaiian ethnicity. The sugar plantation work force in the islands and <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> population of the Hawaiian race had been KalƒÅkaua's ongoing concerns. On December 24, 1880, he signed an act of the legislative assembly acknowledging corruption in the immigration system and authorizing Minister of the Interior Henry A. P. Carter {{to take charge of}} licensing immigration brokers.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had turned back to the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of <b>the</b> <b>dwindling</b> convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
