25|$|Unlike its {{eventual}} successor, the D-1, the M-10 was {{not equipped}} with a muzzle brake. While softening recoil and thus allowing lighter carriage, a muzzle brake has the disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where they raise dust, revealing the gun position.|$|E
25|$|When {{the horse}} shortens its stride, it rebalances its weight toward the hindquarters. In the actual {{collected}} canter, the horse should carry {{the majority of}} its weight on the hind end, rather than the front end. The hindquarters will sink lower <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and the forehand will appear higher and lighter. The horse should maintain tempo, rhythm, and impulsion.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 8.4 mm. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> color of <b>the</b> forewings is whitish gray, although the costal edge is whitish <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> middle. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> color of <b>the</b> hindwings is white, the apex suffused with pale gray.|$|R

25|$|Unlike the F-25, the M-30 was not {{equipped}} with a muzzle brake. While softening recoil and thus allowing for a lighter carriage, the muzzle brake has a disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where they raise dust, revealing the gun's position. Another side-effect of a muzzle brake is the increased muzzle blast behind the gun, adversely affecting the working conditions of its crew.|$|E
25|$|The statue is cast {{in bronze}} and stands upon a square stone base with {{inscriptions}} on each side. The figure {{is that of}} a lone Confederate soldier, who stands facing south with his arms crossed. His wide-brimmed hat is clasped in his right hand and he is looking down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with a somber expression on his face. The soldier is facing south, {{the general direction of the}} battlefields of the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Temperature effect: A fog can {{be caused}} by a {{temperature}} inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-19 mm. The forewings become broader <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> apex. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> {{color is}} pale ochreous, with brown scales scattered sparsely beyond {{two thirds of}} the length. There are two dark-brown discal spots, a small one in the middle and a large one at end of the cell. The hindwings are grayish yellow.|$|R

25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E
500|$|On {{the side}} where the plane hit, the Pentagon is bordered by Interstate 395 and Washington Boulevard. Motorist Mary Lyman, {{who was on}} I-395, saw the {{airplane}} pass over at a [...] "steep angle <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and going fast" [...] and then saw the cloud of smoke from the Pentagon.

500|$|The {{hailstone}} {{will keep}} {{rising in the}} thunderstorm until its mass {{can no longer be}} supported by the updraft. [...] This may take at least 30 minutes based on the force of the updrafts in the hail-producing thunderstorm, whose top is usually greater than 10 km high. [...] It then falls <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> while continuing to grow, based on the same processes, until it leaves the cloud. It will later begin to melt as it passes into air above freezing temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 10-13 mm. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> color of <b>the</b> forewings is divided by a sinuate (wavy) longitudinal line running from the base to the termen. The dorsal area below this line is narrowly white, sending a pointed projection to the Cu fold at the basal one-fourth and another beyond the Cu {{at the end of}} the cell, each projection containing a conspicuous black spot. The remainder of the wing costad of the longitudinal line is brownish black or black, only slightly paler <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> costa. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> color of <b>the</b> hindwings is whitish gray, becoming slightly darker distally.|$|R
60|$|Virginia turned impatiently. The {{look she}} {{bestowed}} upon Miss Cluyme {{was not one}} of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.

500|$|The attitude/thrust {{control system}} {{consisted}} of a large ring situated outside of the main disk, shaped roughly like a rounded triangle with the flat surface on the [...] "inside." [...] Viewing the craft from the side, the control flap is almost invisible, appearing in its neutral position to blend into the profile. The pilot's controls moved the ring {{in relation to the}} rest of the craft, affecting the airflow moving outward from the center of the craft. Vertical lift could be increased by moving the entire ring down, which would produce more airflow over its upper surface, which would then bend down over this surface <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Tilting the ring resulted in asymmetric thrust for directional control.|$|E
500|$|Riders then {{arrive in}} an {{underground}} city named Draconian City, where they battle against Draconians and Archers. Nearing the finale, forward-facing riders see Stansein making his final appearance, following the train. Riders are then confronted by more Draconians and Archers before entering a gold-covered area where King Adelsten's crown is found. Soon after, Ormaar arrives and breathes fire <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> After a few seconds, the drop track releases the train into a [...] free fall, escaping from Ormaar. As the train leaves the drop track, the trains are rotated {{to their original}} positions {{and all of the}} riders' scores are displayed {{on both sides of the}} track. After turning left into the station, riders disembark and the next riders board. One cycle of the ride lasts approximately three-and-a-half minutes.|$|E
500|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight {{begins as}} the train turns {{to the right and}} begins to climb the [...] chain lift hill. After cresting the top of the lift hill, the train drops 100 feet (30m) to the right at 51 miles per hour (82km/h) [...] and prepares to enter the pretzel loop. In a pretzel loop, a train swoops up to a height of [...] before diving <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> looping back under the {{starting}} point.

500|$|The {{first officer}} {{said it was}} [...] "just like we lost lift." [...] As the captain {{attempted}} to level the wings, the crew used right rudder to manoeuvre the aircraft back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and avoid the water below. The accident report found that [...] "the first officer said that they seemed {{to agree that the}} airplane was not going to fly and that their control inputs were in unison." [...] Rachuba and Majure continued to try to hold the nose up to impact in a flat attitude, although Rachuba later stated that there were no [...] "heavy control inputs." [...] The final report further noted that [...] "first officer stated that he did not touch the power levers." [...] The first officer later told investigators that the flight crew's primary focus was to find a safe place to land.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} {{vertebrae}} differs between specimens. [...] E. regalis had thirteen neck vertebrae, eighteen back vertebrae, nine hip vertebrae, and {{an unknown number}} of tail vertebrae. [...] A specimen once identified as belonging to Anatosaurus edmontoni (now considered to be the same as E. regalis) is reported as having an additional back vertebra and 85tail vertebrae, with an undisclosed amount of restoration. Other hadrosaurids are only reported as having 50 to 70tail vertebrae, so this appears to have been an overestimate. The anterior back was curved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> with the neck flexed upward {{and the rest of the}} back and tail held horizontally. Most of the back and tail were lined by ossified tendons arranged in a latticework along the neural spines of the vertebrae. This condition has been described as making the back and at least part of the tail [...] "ramrod" [...] straight. The ossified tendons are interpreted as having strengthened the vertebral column against gravitational stress, incurred through being a large animal with a horizontal vertebral column otherwise supported mostly by the hind legs and hips.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|Open {{and closed}} electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) systems {{based on a}} spin coated {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) layer are presented. The PDMS layer acts as both insulation and hydrophobic material.
