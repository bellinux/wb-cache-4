5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion on <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese offensive, the Nguyen Hue Offensive of 1972 (called the Easter Offensive in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such offensive plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern offensive (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E

As with the judgement of Isaacs J in Whybrow (No 1), Higgins J argues from <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fundamental basis of the Australian legal system was that power was conferred on the Federal Parliament, not by the people of Australia but by the British parliament. Higgins J rejected <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties to the dispute needed to have taken a definite stand or made definite claims, but that an order or award could not be made except as against identified or identifiable parties.|$|E

Other Neoanalysts make the milder claim that the Homeric epics draw on legendary material which later crystallized into the Epic Cycle. This is an ongoing debate.|$|E

The partial order preference has also been determined under <b>the</b> <b>premises</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evaluation index are stochastic, intuitionistic fuzzy and ordinal and the pre-order preference structure is extended to partial order preferences. The combined multi-attribute decision-making model is developed with the uncertain weight of evaluation index, followed by the decision-making process and decision-making method. The feasibility and effectiveness of the approach proposed in this study are illustrated by case study...|$|R

25|$|Eventually, {{generative}} semantics spawned {{an alternative}} linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate {{the understanding of}} language together with the biological function of specific neural structures. Whereas generative semanticists function on <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures—and more significantly—that the cognitive abilities used to process this data {{are similar to those}} used in other non-linguistic tasks. Much of this work is published today under neurolinguistics.|$|E

There were also other debts that consisted of promissory notes issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on <b>the</b> <b>premise</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.|$|E
