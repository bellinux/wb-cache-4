5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute,</b> actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E

She then allows Fatboy to stay with her after Tamwar throws him out. Poppy is then devastated to learn that Fatboy shared a passionate kiss with Denise Fox (Diane Parish), after hearing the pair whispering about it. She then learns that Fatboy and Denise had slept together before he was even in a {{relationship with}} Poppy. This infuriates Poppy, who storms over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minute</b> Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so that they can have a fresh start. Fatboy refuses to move and says he wants to end their relationship. She packs her bags and leaves Walford for Hemel Hempstead, but not before posting a letter through Ian's letterbox, detailing about his fiancée's infidelity.|$|E

25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move.

25|$|Besides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often {{a single}} letter of Hamilton's {{occupied}} from fifty {{to a hundred}} or more closely written pages, all devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for {{it was one of}} the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to be satisfied with a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew it in all its details. Hamilton was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 15 October 1926 his HRH The Prince of Wales visited Halifax. It {{was another}} of several visits the Royal Family made to Halifax during Richardson's time in office. Richardson {{continued}} {{to establish his}} reputation of being a good Organiser and Planner. He prepared the Borough Police by devising a booklet of 28 pages. It shows, in detail, {{the route of the}} cars taking part, crowd control, Sergeants in charge of Sections, mounted police positions, roads to be blocked off and timings – <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b> Everyone taking part had a copy of the booklet so every Policeman on duty knew not only {{what they had to do}} but what other Policemen had to do as well. It had the signature of A.H. Richardson on the cover to prove it was genuine and all copies had to be returned immediately the visit was over. Copies were later sent to other Chief Constables as a template for any Royal Visit they might get.|$|E
500|$|Highly {{specialized}} {{for life}} in the deep sea, the frilled shark has a reduced, poorly calcified skeleton and an enormous liver filled with low-density lipids, allowing it to maintain {{its position in the}} water column with little effort. It {{is one of the few}} sharks with an [...] "open" [...] lateral line, in which the mechanoreceptive hair cells are positioned in grooves that are directly exposed to the surrounding seawater. This configuration is thought to be basal in sharks and may enhance its sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> movements of its prey. Many frilled sharks are found with the tips of their tails missing, probably from predatory attacks by other shark species. Parasites identified from this shark include a tapeworm in the genus Monorygma, the fluke Otodistomum veliporum, and the nematode Mooleptus rabuka.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of measurement reform in France {{was placed in}} the hands of the French Academy of Sciences who appointed a commission chaired by Jean-Charles de Borda. Borda could be said to have been a fanatic for decimalization: he had designed the repeating circle, a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in [...] "grades" [...] ( [...] of a quarter-circle) rather than degrees, with 100minutes to a grade and 100seconds to a minute. The instrument was manufactured by Étienne Lenoir. For Borda, the seconds pendulum was a poor choice for a standard because the second (as a unit of time) was insufficiently decimal: he preferred the new system of 10hours to the day, 100minutes to the hour and 100seconds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
500|$|The teleosts or Teleostei (Greek: teleios, [...] "complete" [...] + osteon, [...] "bone") {{are by far}} {{the largest}} infraclass in the class Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes, and make up 96% of all extant species of fish. This diverse group arose in the Triassic period, and members are {{arranged}} in about 40 orders and 448 families. Over 26,000 species have been described. Teleosts range from giant oarfish measuring [...] or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over , <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> male anglerfish Photocorynus spiniceps, just [...] long. Including not only torpedo-shaped fish built for speed, teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally, be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses. Teleosts dominate the seas from pole to pole and inhabit the ocean depths, estuaries, rivers, lakes and even swamps.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the group {{received}} {{a large sum}} of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers' income. This capital was used to rent houses, initially in Denver and later in Dallas. Applewhite and Nettles had about 40followers then and lived {{in two or three}} houses: the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers' lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a [...] "craft", they regimented the lives of their disciples <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b> Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted [...] "quality over quantity" [...] in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.|$|E

500|$|On {{the campus}} of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> after the team of {{physicists}} led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's Nuclear Energy was unveiled on the site of what was once the university's football field stands, in the rackets court beneath which the experiments had taken place. This 12-foot-tall piece {{in the middle of a}} large, open plaza is often thought to represent a mushroom cloud topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would [...] "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that they may have a feeling of being in a cathedral." [...] In Chicago, Illinois, Moore also commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named Man Enters the Cosmos (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the space exploration program.|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E

Peaking at number 20 in the US and number 30 in the UK. Lennon promoted the song by appearing on the BBC TV show Old Grey Whistle Test, which also featured an interview by Bob Harris. The show had Lennon singing live over the backing tracks of [...] "Stand by Me" [...] and [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'". Lennon also appeared on Salute to Sir Lew – The Master Showman singing live again over backing tracks, this time for three songs: [...] "Stand by Me", [...] "Slippin' and Slidin'" [...] and [...] "Imagine".
