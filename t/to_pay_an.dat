5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E

It was not announced until 18 August 1842, following Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II's ratifying the governorship, and requiring Brooke <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual sum of $2,500 to the Sultan.

Some Cuman groups, after their defeat of the Mongols, become willing to adopt Christianity. As early as 1227, one of the Cuman chieftains, Boricius subjected himself and his people to the future King Béla IV of Hungary, converted to Christianity and agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual tax and the tithe. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania, located in northeastern Wallachia and southwestern Moldavia, was established in 1228. A significant presence of the Vlachs within the newly established bishopric is documented in the correspondence between the Hungarian crown prince and Pope Gregory IX (1227–1241), as the pope complained about Orthodox prelates active among the local Vlachs.|$|E

5|$|Two ambassadors {{were sent}} by Emperor Maximilian: Croatian Antun Vrančić and Styrian Christoph Teuffenbach. They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well {{received}} by Sultan Selim II. An agreement {{ending the war}} between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568, after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (also known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović, being originally from Bosnia). The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568. Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight-year truce, although the agreement brought 25 years of (relative) peace between the Empires until the Long War. The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual tribute of 30,000 ducats.|$|E

5|$|Two armies were {{dispatched}} {{against the}} Song. One army captured {{the provincial capital}} of Taiyuan, while the other besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng. The Jurchens withdrew when the Song promised <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual indemnity. As the Song dynasty weakened, the Jin armies conducted a second siege against Kaifeng. The city was captured and looted, and the Song dynasty emperor, Emperor Qinzong, was imprisoned and taken north to Manchuria as a hostage. The remainder of the Song court retreated to southern China, beginning the Southern Song period of Chinese history. Two puppet governments, first the Da Chu dynasty and later the state of Qi, were established by the Jin as buffer states between the Song and Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.|$|E
5|$|Although France had not {{completely}} defeated Austria, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political {{toll on the}} Austrians. As {{a result of the}} treaty, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles, the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians, and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of her total population. Emperor Francis also agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon's brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions.. The Austrian defeat {{paved the way for the}} marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Dangerously, Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria as a future threat, but the Habsburgs were not as driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought.|$|E

5|$|As a consequence, Austria {{withdrew from}} the Coalition. Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal officials could not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take Ayutthaya, Tabinshwehti claimed to have regained control of the Tavoy frontier. Indeed, the Burmese chronicles claim the Siamese king had agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> annual tribute. Even if this claim was true, the Toungoo Dynasty's control over Tavoy lasted {{a little over a}} year in any case. Tabinshwehti was assassinated just a year after the Siamese {{campaign}} on 30 April 1550, and the empire he had built in the previous 16 years quickly collapsed, with each town claiming a king. Even after Bayinnaung had restored the kingdom in the following years, the frontier region was likely under overlapping spheres of influence. (During his 1554–1555 campaign against Upper Burma, his southernmost garrison was at Ye, not Tavoy.) It was only in 1562 that Bayinnaung made an emphatic claim on the region by setting up a Burmese garrison at Tavoy, in preparation for his invasion of Siam a year later.|$|E
