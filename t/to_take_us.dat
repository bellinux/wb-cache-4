5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

The younger, telegenic, and well-funded Romney ran as a businessman who stated he had created ten thousand jobs and as a Washington outsider with a solid family image and moderate stances on social issues. When Kennedy tried to tie Romney's policies to those of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Romney responded, [...] "Look, I was an independent {{during the time of}} Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> back to Reagan-Bush." [...] Romney stated, [...] "Ultimately, this is a campaign about change." ...|$|E
500|$|When she was {{six years}} old, Song moved with her mother to Los Angeles, California, to support her acting career; {{the rest of the}} family {{followed}} two years later. As a young girl, Song wanted to do ballet, while her younger brother wanted to take taekwondo. She said, [...] "My mom only wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> to one place," [...] so they settled on taekwondo. Although Song cried all the way through her first class, she now holds a black belt in taekwondo. Song was named an All-American Scholar in the ninth grade. She was homeschooled and earned a high school diploma at age 16, then took courses at a community college and online from the University of California, Berkeley, with a major in psychology and a minor in business.|$|E

U.S. President Barack Obama wrote, [...] "Roger was the movies... the unique power of the movies <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> somewhere magical... The movies won't be the same without Roger". Robert Redford called Ebert [...] "one of the great champions of freedom of artistic expression" [...] and said [...] "His personal passion for cinema was boundless, and that is sure to be his legacy for generations to come." [...] Oprah Winfrey called Ebert's death the [...] "end of an era", as did Steven Spielberg, who also said that Ebert's [...] "reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down.

500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked for a miracle. Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> by magic, he {{will not be able to}} do so with all people." [...] Traditions transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abbas briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details. Traditions transmitted on the authority of Abdullah bin Masud describe the incident as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, in a lot of ways, trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he knew everything, but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Bob Daily and directed by David Grossman. Filming for the episode began on July 11, 2011. The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Republic writer Ruth Franklin {{said that}} [...] "The show's method is <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>us</b> {{behind the scenes}} of the {{branding}} of American icons—Lucky Strike cigarettes, Hilton hotels, Life cereal—to show us not how the products themselves were created, but how their 'very sexy … very magical' images were dreamed up." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "In this way, we are all Don Drapers, obsessed with selling an image rather than tending to what lies underneath. Draper's fatal flaw is his lack of psychological awareness: He is at once perfectly tuned into the desires of America and entirely out of touch with his own character". One reviewer said that [...] "Identity is a key theme in Mad Men, and nobody is ever quite who they appear to be. Each one is filled with thwarted ambitions and frustrated dreams, none more so than Don Draper himself, whose closet, it's gradually revealed over Seasons 1 and 2, is filled with proverbial skeletons." ...|$|E

[...] Mark Kemp from Creative Loafing gave {{a positive}} review for her performance in Atlanta writing: [...] "Madonna has continued to grow, {{not just as a}} musical performer but as a musical stage actor, deconstructionist and reconstructionist. Her MDNA Tour is not a concert— it's a theater event, complete with concepts and routines that range from well-thought-out to somewhat abstruse. The singer is as committed as ever to making statements and being provocative— that's her stock-in-trade, after all— and her non-hit material is every bit as adventurous and challenging as any of her hits. More so, in many cases." ...|$|E
