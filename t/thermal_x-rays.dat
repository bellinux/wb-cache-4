5000|$|To {{maximize}} {{the production of}} x-rays, the W-71 {{is reported to have}} used a gold tamper, rather than the usual depleted uranium or lead. The lining normally serves the primary purpose of capturing x-ray energy within the bomb casing while the primary is exploding and triggering the secondary.

40|$|It {{was found}} that advection-dominated {{accretion}} flow (ADAF) +thin disk model calculations can reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of two low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), provided they are accreting at similar to 0. 01 - 0. 03 Eddington rates and the thin disks are truncated to ADAFs at similar to 100 R(S) (R(S) is the Schwarzschild radius) for M 81 and NGC 4579 (Quataert et al. 1999). However, the black hole masses adopted in their work are about one order of magnitude lower than recent measurements on these two sources. Adopting the well estimated black hole masses, our ADAF+thin disk model calculations can reproduce the observed SEDs of these two low-luminosity AGNs, if the black hole is accreting at 2. 5 x 10 (- 4) Eddington rates with the thin disk truncated at R(tr) = 120 R(S) for M 81 ((m) over dot = 3. 3 x 10 (- 3) and R(tr) = 80 R(S) are required for NGC 4579). The transition zones with temperature from the thin disk with similar to 10 (4) - 10 (5) to similar to 10 (9) - 10 (10) K in the ADAF will inevitably emit <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> lines, which provides a useful diagnosis of their physical properties.

40|$|Gamma-ray loud X-ray {{binaries}} are binary {{systems that}} show non-thermal broadband emission from radio to gamma rays. If the system comprises a massive star {{and a young}} non-accreting pulsar, their winds will collide producing broadband non-thermal emission, most likely originated in the shocked pulsar wind. <b>Thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission is expected from the shocked stellar wind, but until now it has neither been detected nor studied {{in the context of}} gamma-ray binaries. We present a semi-analytic model of the <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission from the shocked stellar wind in pulsar gamma-ray binaries, and find that the <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission increases monotonically with the pulsar spin-down luminosity, reaching luminosities of the order of 10 ^ 33 erg/s. The lack of thermal features in the X-ray spectrum of gamma-ray binaries can then be used to constrain the properties of the pulsar and stellar winds. By fitting the observed X-ray spectra of gamma-ray binaries with a source model composed of an absorbed non-thermal power law and the computed <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission, we are able to derive upper limits on the spin-down luminosity of the putative pulsar.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of X-ray {{emission}} from rotation-powered pulsars, which in general consist of one nonthermal component, two hard thermal components, and one soft thermal component. The nonthermal X-rays come from synchrotron radiation of e± pairs created in the strong magnetic field near the neutron star surface by curvature photons emitted by charged particles on their way from the outer gap to the neutron star surface. The first hard thermal X-ray component results from polar-cap heating by the return current in the polar gap. The second hard thermal X-ray component results from polar-cap heating by the return particles from the outer gap. Because of cyclotron resonance scattering, most of the hard <b>thermal</b> <b>X-rays</b> will be effectively reflected back to the stellar surface and eventually reemitted as soft <b>thermal</b> <b>X-rays.</b> However, some of the hard <b>thermal</b> <b>X-rays</b> can still escape along the open magnetic field lines, where the e+/e- pair density is low. Furthermore, the characteristic blackbody temperatures of the two hard X-ray components emitted from the polar-cap area inside the polar gap and the polar-cap area defined by the footprints of the outer-gap magnetic field lines are strongly affected by the surface magnetic field, which can be {{much larger than the}} dipolar field. In fact, the strong surface magnetic field can explain why the effective blackbody radiation area is nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than that deduced from the dipolar field for young pulsars (2 orders of magnitude less for old pulsars).

We have found an HI intensity depression in the velocity range between $- 46 $ and $- 28 $ km s$^{- 1 }$ toward the SNR, suggesting a cavity in the interstellar medium. The HI cavity coincides with the thermal and non-thermal emitting X-ray shell. The <b>thermal</b> <b>X-rays</b> are coincident with the edge of the HI distribution, which indicates a strong density gradient, while the non-thermal X-rays are found toward the less dense, inner part of the HI cavity. The most significant non-thermal X-rays are seen toward the southwestern part of the shell where the HI gas traces the dense and cold component. We also identified CO clouds which are likely interacting with the SNR shock waves in the same velocity range as the HI, although the CO clouds are distributed only in a limited part of the SNR shell. The most massive cloud is located in the southeastern part of the shell, showing detailed correspondence with the <b>thermal</b> <b>X-rays.</b> These CO clouds show an enhanced CO $J$ = 2 - 1 / 1 - 0 intensity ratio, suggesting heating/compression by the shock front.

It is found that the emission can explain early <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission recently found in some long gamma-ray bursts. The result implies that the difference of the circumstellar environment of long gamma-ray bursts can be probed by observing their early <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission.

40|$|The X-ray {{spectra of}} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can {{generally}} be described by an absorbed power law. The landmark discovery of <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission {{in addition to}} the power law in the unusual GRB 060218, followed by a similar discovery in GRB 100316 D, showed that during the first thousand seconds after trigger the soft X-ray spectra can be complex. Both the origin and prevalence of such spectral components still evade understanding, particularly after the discovery of <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission in the classical GRB 090618. Possibly most importantly, these three objects are all associated with optical supernovae (SNe), begging {{the question of whether the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> components could be a result of the GRB-SN connection, possibly in the shock breakout. We therefore performed a search for blackbody components in the early Swift X-ray spectra of 11 GRBs that have or may have associated optical SNe, accurately recovering the thermal components reported in the literature for GRBs 060218, 090618 and 100316 D. We present the discovery of a cooling blackbody in GRB 101219 B/SN 2010 ma, and in four further GRB-SNe we find an improvement in the fit with a blackbody which we deem possible blackbody candidates due to case-specific caveats. All the possible new blackbody components we report lie at the high end of the luminosity and radius distribution. GRB 101219 B appears to bridge the gap between the low-luminosity and the classical GRB-SNe with thermal emission, and following the blackbody evolution we derive an expansion velocity for this source of the order of 0. 4 c. We discuss potential origins for the <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> emission in our sample, including a cocoon model which we find can accommodate the more extreme physical parameters implied by many of our model fits.

40|$|The fluxes and {{spectra of}} the flare {{electrons}} measured on board Venera-I 3 and I 4 space probes are {{compared with the}} parameters of the hard (E sub x approximately 55 keV) and <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> bursts. The electron flux amplitude has been found to correlate with flare importance in the <b>thermal</b> <b>X-ray</b> range (r approximately 0. 8). The following two types of flare events have been found in the electron component of SCR. The electron flux increase is accompanied by a hard X-ray burst and the electron spectrum index in the approximately 25 to 200 keV energy range is gamma approximately 2 to 3. The electron flux increase is not accompanied by a hard X-ray burst and the electron spectrum is softer (Delta gamma approximately 0. 7 to 1. 0) ...|$|R
