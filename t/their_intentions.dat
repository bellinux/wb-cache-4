5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of <b>their</b> <b>intentions.</b> He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of <b>their</b> <b>intentions,</b> Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
5|$|Graham Cluley, a {{security}} expert for Sophos, argued that Anonymous' actions against child porn websites hosted on a darknet could be counterproductive, commenting that while <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> may be good, {{the removal of}} illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, {{speculation}} {{began on}} what Hunt would do past the expiration {{of his contract}} {{at the end of}} the 2009 season. With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt is expected to be the target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000. The Broncos however, were still expected to be a factor in his decision with the possibility of the captaincy a possible lure to remain with the Broncos.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> in this regard.|$|E

After her management team had expressed <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol struggles.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> not {{to renew}} their existing deal with Viacom. Since then, Viacom's deal with Netflix expired, and shows such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer were removed. On June 4, 2013, Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement which would move its programs, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com, Netflix's top competitor.

5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Those {{involved}} {{were taken}} before a tribunal in November 1913, where the leaders freely stated <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> of overthrowing the French colonial regime. Of the 111 people arrested, the tribunal convicted 104, of whom 63 received prison sentences. During the trial, some community leaders {{wrote to the}} Governor-General of Indochina, blaming French oppression of the populace through corvee labour and the confiscation of land, for the discontent {{that led to the}} uprising. The prosecutor also criticised the way in which colonial authorities operated.|$|E
5|$|When BSkyB publicised <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to {{take over}} Manchester United, {{supporters}} reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E

5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened {{what remained of the}} Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> {{to develop}} The Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct {{and write the}} screenplay.

The film will follow immediately {{from the end of}} The Incredibles with the Parrs facing the Underminer. The film will focus on Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl. Originally, The Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the releases, and currently The Incredibles 2 is set for release on June 15, 2018.|$|E
5|$|During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), {{some one}} hundred Russian ciphers were {{broken by a}} sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who {{included}} army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics — Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> and operational orders.|$|E

5|$|FBI agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and {{his partner}} of five years, Robert Danzig (Joe Flanigan), are {{pursuing}} an arms dealer; while Lee apprehends the man, his partner is killed by a second, mysterious man with translucent skin and seemingly superhuman abilities. The skin of Danzig's body also becomes translucent after he dies. When forensics comes on the scene, Olivia and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) appear and take the agent's body without revealing <b>their</b> <b>intentions.</b> Lincoln follows Olivia to the lab, where he is introduced to the Fringe division. Despite Olivia attempting to keep Lincoln away, he continues to follow the investigation as they discover another victim killed in a similar manner. From a witness, they learn about {{the appearance of the}} killer, but are unable to identify him by name.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than four}} years after his election, Metropolitan Jonah {{was asked by the}} Holy Synod, in a {{unanimous}} decision, to resign from his position. While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt prompted to release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about <b>their</b> <b>intentions.</b> The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle off {{the island}} of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman troops and 12 galleys {{attempted}} to seize a small Venetian galley squadron. Forewarned of <b>their</b> <b>intentions</b> Morosini reinforced it, and won a costly victory, {{which was to be}} Venice's last victory at sea in this war. Reinforced again with Papal and Hospitaller ships, the Venetians maintained a blockade of Canea, the Ottomans' main supply base, during summer. To secure their anchorage off St Todero island, the allied forces seized the fortress island of St Marina, a minor success which did not in the end prevent the Kapudan pasha's fleet, bearing fresh troops and supplies, from reaching Canea in September, after the Maltese–Papal squadron had departed.|$|E
