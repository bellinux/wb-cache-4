5|$|Two tramps, named Dusty and Weary, awake {{from their}} slumber in a hay stock and are {{overcome}} with thirst. The two drink from a horse trough and Dusty complains of toothache. The two go to <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> office {{only to be}} kicked out. When <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull teeth with pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive off again. The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E
5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of <b>the</b> <b>dentist.</b> Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince {{in mind when he}} saw him in the Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>dentist,</b> {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|The first Japanese {{mainstream}} {{film with}} nudity was Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh, (1964), and Takechi {{made the first}} big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream(白日夢), the same year. Like Women... Oh, Women!, Daydream was produced independently but Shochiku studios distributed the film. This time, the studio gave Takechi's film a major publicity campaign. Based on a 1926 short story by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, the film was a black comedy involving a series of sex scenes imagined by an artist under anesthesia in a dentist's office. After being drugged, the artist watches helplessly {{from the other side}} of a window as <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> tortures and performs a series of sexual acts on a female patient.|$|E

30|$|No {{less than}} 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> had {{patients}} who were {{admitted to the hospital}} or became homebound after receiving implant treatment at their clinic. Twenty-two percent of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> had been consulted about <b>the</b> implants. <b>Dentists</b> who continued to provide post-operative implant care through home-visit dental care accounted for approximately 80 %. On the other hand, however, 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> did not know the post-implantation status of their implant patients. Of the patients receiving home-visit dental care, approximately 3 % had implants (identified mainly by visual inspection). It was found that more than 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> offering implant treatment did not use the implant card, and even in cases where it was used, most of the cards were not in the standardized format.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} found that no less than 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> had {{patients}} who were {{admitted to the hospital}} or became bedridden at home after receiving implant treatment at their clinic and that 22 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> had been consulted about <b>the</b> implants. <b>Dentists</b> who had provided continued post-operative implant care through home-visit dental care accounted for approximately 80 %, whereas 40 % of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> did not know the post-implantation status of their implant patients. Moreover, because <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> who answered “I have no patients that were admitted to the hospital or became bedridden at home” (27 %) are likely to include those who were not aware of such patients, it can be inferred that a larger number of dentists do not know the status of their implant patients after placement of the implants, which suggests the need to facilitate an understanding of the post-implantation status of patients.|$|R
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} the voice of <b>the</b> <b>dentist,</b> Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline {{was supposed to be}} O. J. Simpson, but he turned it down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. <b>The</b> <b>dentist</b> will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E

5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E
5|$|While at <b>the</b> <b>dentist,</b> Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads {{an article}} about China's growing global power, and he decides that China must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael {{for a cup of}} coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E

Results showed that nine in ten (91. 2 %) dentists provide oral hygiene instructions to their patients. Majority (78. 1 %) of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> provide <b>the</b> oral hygiene instructions at the first and last dental visit. More than four-fifth (83. 3 %) of <b>the</b> <b>dentists</b> provide dietary advice to their parents and the majority (78. 1 %) provide it only at the first dental visit.

For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated <b>the</b> <b>dentist</b> (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit <b>the</b> <b>dentist.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{frequency}} of routine use of dental prophylaxis prior to visual inspection, in order to diagnose caries, by dentists with different lapses of time after graduating time.
