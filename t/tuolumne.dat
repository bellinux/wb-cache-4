5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} <b>Tuolumne</b> River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the <b>Tuolumne</b> River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Ayres {{returned}} in 1856 and visited <b>Tuolumne</b> Meadows in the area's high country. His highly detailed angularly exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were distributed nationally and an art exhibition of his drawings {{was held in}} New York City.|$|E
5|$|Paiutes {{were the}} primary {{inhabitants}} of the Yosemite area and the foothills to the east during the Mariposa and historic phases. The Central Sierra Miwoks lived along the drainage area of the <b>Tuolumne</b> and Stanislaus Rivers, while the Paiutes inhabited the upper drainage of the Merced and Chowchilla Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} three groves of ancient giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the <b>Tuolumne</b> Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume {{than any other}} {{and is one of}} the tallest and longest-lived.|$|E
5|$|Yosemite Valley is open year-round and {{numerous}} activities {{are available through}} the National Park Service, Yosemite Conservancy, and Delaware North at Yosemite, including nature walks, photography and art classes, stargazing programs, tours, bike rentals, rafting, mule and horseback rides, and rock climbing classes. Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, <b>Tuolumne,</b> or Merced Groves. Others like to drive or take a tour bus to Glacier Point (summer–fall) to see a spectacular view of Yosemite Valley and the high country, or drive along the scenic Tioga Road to <b>Tuolumne</b> Meadows (May–October) {{and go for a}} walk or hike.|$|E
5|$|The long horseback {{ride from}} Merced {{remained}} {{a deterrent to}} tourists. Three stagecoach roads {{were built in the}} mid-1870s to provide better access; Coulterville Road (June 1874), Big Oak Flat Road (July 1874), and the Wawona Road (July 1875). A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway, and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883, which roughly followed the Mono Trail to <b>Tuolumne</b> Meadows.|$|E
5|$|The park can {{be divided}} into 5 {{sections}} for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, <b>Tuolumne</b> Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the Park Service in Yosemite. Park rangers encourage visitors to experience portions of the park in addition to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the <b>Tuolumne</b> put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{was formed}} in 1916, and Yosemite was {{transferred}} to that agency's jurisdiction. <b>Tuolumne</b> Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916. Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the construction of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 {{through the efforts of}} Ansel Franklin Hall.In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many of the Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from Yosemite in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Macau was {{substituted}} for Shanghai, while cinematographer Douglas Slocombe caught fever from June 24 to July 7 {{and could not}} work. Ford returned on August 8. Despite the problems during filming, Spielberg was able to complete Temple of Doom on schedule and on budget, finishing principal photography on August 26. Various pick-ups took place afterwards. This included Snake River Canyon, in Idaho, Mammoth Mountain, <b>Tuolumne</b> and American River, Yosemite National Park, San Joaquin Valley, Hamilton Air Force Base and Arizona. Producer Frank Marshall directed a second unit in Florida in January 1984, using alligators to double as crocodiles. The mine chase {{was a combination of}} a roller coaster and scale models with dolls doubling for the actors. Minor stop motion was also used for the sequence. Visual effects supervisors Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and a crew at Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects work, while Skywalker Sound, headed by Ben Burtt, commissioned the sound design. Burtt recorded Willie Scott's scream and roller coasters at Disneyland Park in Anaheim for the mine cart scene.|$|E
5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the <b>Tuolumne</b> County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E
5|$|The United States Forest Service made {{it their}} highest {{priority}} {{fire at the}} time because of the threat to local communities and its proximity to Yosemite National Park. Though Giant Sequoia trees, {{some of the biggest}} and oldest living things on Earth, are very fire-tolerant and need fire to reproduce, concerns rose as the fire approached them. Park officials set sprinklers to help protect nearby Sequoia trees, but the sprinklers were later removed and careful low-intensity prescribed burns were used. Parts of the National Forest are used for grazing, and the blaze impacted 6 of 14 grazing allotments located within the fire perimeter where displaced cattle were scattered over a wide area. Smoke from the fire caused unhealthy air conditions in Reno, Nevada, and the Lake Tahoe area {{during the first week of}} the fire, forcing the cancellation of several outdoor events. School children were sent home due to smoky conditions as well. From Yosemite to the San Joaquin Valley, air quality reached unhealthy levels several times according to the National Weather Service. Berkeley <b>Tuolumne</b> Camp, a family camp operated by the city of Berkeley, established in 1922, was burned to the ground. Nearby Camp Tawonga suffered some damage, including the loss of three buildings. Camp Mather, operated by the city of San Francisco, suffered minor damage, as did the San Jose Camp run by the city of San Jose.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2013, the {{district}} covered parts of Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, <b>Tuolumne,</b> and Stanislaus counties.|$|E
25|$|Before damming, {{the valley}} floor {{contained}} abundant stands of black oaks, live oak, Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and silver fir bordering the meadows, with alder, willow, poplar and dogwood in the riparian zone along the <b>Tuolumne</b> River. The valley's abundant plants provided nourishment for mule deer, black bears and bighorn sheep. Due to large cataracts on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River upstream, Hetch Hetchy Valley {{may have been in}} the uppermost range for native rainbow trout in the river.|$|E
25|$|An {{abandoned}} HHRR {{bridge across}} the <b>Tuolumne</b> River was removed between 1967 and 1971 to clear the canyon {{for the expansion of}} Lake Don Pedro.|$|E
25|$|Vicinity {{watercourses}} {{include the}} Stanislaus River, the <b>Tuolumne</b> River and Dry Creek empties into the <b>Tuolumne</b> River. Area groundwater, {{which is the}} principal source of water supply in the city, has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Resovoir is now used to augment city water. In {{various parts of the}} city and its perimeter the following water pollutants have occurred from time to time: nitrates, dibromochloromethane, volatile organics, salinity, total dissolved solids and other pesticides. Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.|$|E
25|$|The Central Sierra Miwok {{inhabited}} the upper watersheds of the Stanislaus River and the <b>Tuolumne</b> River. They spoke Central Sierra Miwok, a {{language in the}} Utian linguistic group.|$|E
25|$|Interest {{in using}} the valley as a water source or {{reservoir}} dates {{back as far as}} the 1850s, when the <b>Tuolumne</b> Valley Water Company proposed developing water storage there for irrigation. By the 1880s, San Francisco was looking to Hetch Hetchy water as a fix for its outdated and unreliable water system. The city would try repeatedly to acquire water rights to Hetch Hetchy, including in 1901, 1903 and 1905, but was continually rebuffed because of conflicts with irrigation districts that had senior water rights on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River, and because of the valley's national park status.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, a {{subgroup}} of the Bonneville Expedition led by Joseph Reddeford Walker was sent westward {{to find an}} overland route to California. Eventually the party discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, ascending the Sierra Nevada, starting near present-day Bridgeport and descending between the <b>Tuolumne</b> and Merced River drainage. The group {{may have been the}} first non-indigenous people to see Yosemite Valley. The Walker party probably visited either the <b>Tuolumne</b> or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|While its cousin Yosemite Valley to {{the south}} had {{permanent}} Miwok settlements, Hetch Hetchy was only seasonally inhabited. This was likely because of Hetch Hetchy's narrow outlet, which in years of heavy snowmelt created a bottleneck in the <b>Tuolumne</b> River and the subsequent flooding of the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|Compared with Yosemite Valley, {{the walls}} of Hetch Hetchy are {{smoother}} and rounder because it was glaciated to a greater extent. This is because the <b>Tuolumne</b> catchment basin above Hetch Hetchy is almost three times {{as large as the}} catchment area of the Merced River above Yosemite, allowing a greater volume of ice to form.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club opposes dams it {{considers}} inappropriate, including some government-built dams in national parks. In the early 20th century, the organization {{fought against the}} damming and flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Despite this lobbying, Congress authorized the construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River. The Sierra Club continues to support removal of the dam.|$|E
25|$|On July 5, 1969, at 12:40a.m., a man {{phoned the}} Vallejo Police Department to report and claim {{responsibility}} for the attack. The caller also took credit for the murders of Jensen and Faraday six-and-a-half months earlier. The police traced the call to a phone booth {{at a gas station}} at Springs Road and <b>Tuolumne,</b> about three-tenths of a mile from Ferrin's home and only {{a few blocks from the}} Vallejo Police Department.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the city}} {{is located on the}} <b>Tuolumne</b> River and near the Stanislaus River, it has no {{operating}} port for oceangoing ships due to the shallow depths of these rivers, and also due to a small dam on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River near Highway 99. In Modesto there is also a small creek aptly named Dry Creek, which although badly polluted by agricultural runoff, is adjacent to several parks in Modesto. Most of the rivers and streams are otherwise not accessible to public use or view due to fences and private property rights. There are no public boat ramps or docks within the city limits. Although summertime brings high temperatures, swimming is prohibited by local ordinance in rivers, creeks, and the many irrigation canals. Rivers and lakes near Waterford are wide enough to be accessible for a kayak, or small motorboat, and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when hydroelectric power dams were installed upstream for valuable flood control, irrigation, and electric power generation. The nearest large open seaport is the Port of Stockton, used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.|$|E
25|$|Hetch Hetchy is {{the name}} of a valley, a {{reservoir}} and a water system in California in the United States. The glacial Hetch Hetchy Valley lies in the northwestern part of Yosemite National Park and is drained by the <b>Tuolumne</b> River. For thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the 1850s, the valley was inhabited by Native Americans who practiced subsistence hunting-gathering. During the late 19th century, the valley was renowned for its natural beauty – often compared to that of Yosemite Valley – but also targeted for the development of water supply for irrigation and municipal interests.|$|E
25|$|Modesto's {{population}} was over 1,000 residents in 1884. With fields of grain, a nearby <b>Tuolumne</b> River for grain barges, and railroad traffic, the town grew. Irrigation water came from dams {{installed in the}} foothills, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit and nut trees flourished. By 1900, Modesto's {{population was}} over 4,500. During World War II, the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US armed forces and Allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto's population grew about two percent per year to over 100,000 in 1980, and over 200,000 in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Water from Hetch Hetchy {{is some of}} {{the cleanest}} {{municipal}} water in the United States; San Francisco is one of six U.S. cities not required by law to filter its tap water, although the water is disinfected by ozonation and, since 2011, exposure to UV. The water quality is high because of the unique geology of the upper <b>Tuolumne</b> River drainage basin, which consists mostly of bare granite; as a result, the rivers feeding Hetch Hetchy Reservoir have extremely low loads of sediments and nutrients. The watershed is also strictly protected, so swimming and boating are prohibited at the reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it).|$|E
25|$|Seven major tributaries flow {{directly}} into the San Joaquin River, all of which run from the Sierra Nevada westwards into the main stem. In addition, some of the discharge of the Kings River also enters the San Joaquin directly (but seasonally) through a distributary. Of these, the <b>Tuolumne</b> River is the largest in any respect: longest, greatest drainage basin, and highest discharge. The Merced River is the second largest by length and drainage basin, but the Mokelumne River has a greater flow. Tributaries are listed below proceeding from the mouth upstream, with their respective main-stem length, watershed and discharge noted. Rivers of the Tulare Basin are noted below the San Joaquin's direct tributaries with their individual data. Most of the tributaries had much larger flows before irrigation diversions – for example, the Tuolumne's historic discharge was almost 48% higher than it is now.|$|E
500|$|Behind the dam, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir {{stretches}} for [...] {{along the}} <b>Tuolumne</b> River, submerging Hetch Hetchy Valley and the lowermost {{section of the}} Grand Canyon of the <b>Tuolumne.</b> At maximum capacity, the reservoir stores , covering [...] The dam and reservoir receive water from the upper [...] of the <b>Tuolumne</b> River watershed, and are supplied with water by Falls Creek, Tiltill Creek, and Rancheria Creek {{in addition to the}} main stem of the <b>Tuolumne.</b> Hetch Hetchy is accessed by the Evergreen/Hetch Hetchy Road, which runs [...] from Big Oak Flat along the <b>Tuolumne</b> River and terminates at the crest of the dam. The road is open seasonally as it is not plowed in the winter months.|$|E
500|$|New Don Pedro Dam, often known {{simply as}} Don Pedro Dam, is an earthen {{embankment}} dam across the <b>Tuolumne</b> River, about [...] northeast of La Grange, in <b>Tuolumne</b> County, California. The dam was completed in 1971, {{after four years of}} construction, to replace the 1924 concrete-arch Don Pedro Dam.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Tuolumne</b> and Merced River systems {{originate}} {{along the}} crest of the Sierra Nevada in the park and have carved river canyons [...] deep. The <b>Tuolumne</b> River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately [...] The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately [...]|$|E
500|$|During the Rim Fire, forest {{closures}} {{were put}} into effect and evacuation orders were issued by the <b>Tuolumne</b> and Mariposa County County Sheriff's Offices. Several thousand people [...] left their homes temporarily {{as a result of}} the evacuations. The Tioga Pass Road (Highway 120) was closed for a time. Highways 140 from Merced and 41 from Fresno remained open throughout the fire, providing access to the national park. Law Enforcement Command Posts were set up in the communities of Groveland and <b>Tuolumne</b> City, with hundreds of local and mutual aid Law Enforcement Officers from dozens of agencies responding to assist in evacuations, patrols, and road closures in the affected areas. The event is credited for being the single largest Law Enforcement mutual aid event in the history of the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid System. At the height of the danger, an estimated 15,000 residents were under evacuation order or advisory, with plans drafted by a Search & Rescue Incident Management Team to evacuate the communities of Groveland, Pine Mountain Lake, Big Oak Flat, <b>Tuolumne</b> City, <b>Tuolumne</b> Rancheria, Ponderosa Hills, Sherwood Forest, Sugar Pine, and Miwuk Village. Several commendations and citations were issued by the county and state for these efforts to the <b>Tuolumne</b> County Sheriff's SAR Team, Sheriff's SAR Field Training Officer Jonathan Rodriguez, and Sheriff's SAR Volunteer Tornado Paul.|$|E
500|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam is a [...] high {{concrete}} {{arch-gravity dam}} in <b>Tuolumne</b> County, California, in the United States. It impounds the <b>Tuolumne</b> River, forming the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir {{at the lower}} end of Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, about [...] east of San Francisco. The dam and reservoir are the source for the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which provides water for over two million people in San Francisco and other municipalities of the west Bay Area. The dam is named for engineer Michael O'Shaughnessy, who oversaw its construction.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{the city of}} San Francisco was rapidly {{outgrowing}} its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. The city looked east to the Sierra Nevada, where snowmelt fed the headwaters for many of California's largest rivers. In 1890, San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River, {{one of the largest}} southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply. In 1900, a United States Geological Survey (USGS) report also described the <b>Tuolumne</b> River as [...] "the best source of sustainable water for San Francisco". Although Phelan managed to secure water rights for the <b>Tuolumne</b> River in 1901, his appeals to the federal government for development of the Hetch Hetchy Valley were unsuccessful. But when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire razed the city, the dangerous inadequacies of the city's water supply system were brought to national light.|$|E
500|$|When {{the last}} glacial period or Ice Age arrived, {{a series of}} four {{tremendous}} valley glaciers filled the upper basin of the Merced River. These glaciers rose in branches upstream of Yosemite Valley, descending from the Merced River headwaters, Tenaya Canyon and Illilouette Creek. Tenaya Canyon was actually eroded even deeper by {{an arm of the}} <b>Tuolumne</b> Glacier, which formed the Grand Canyon of the <b>Tuolumne</b> and Hetch Hetchy Valley on the <b>Tuolumne</b> River in the north. Little Yosemite Valley formed {{as a result of the}} underlying rock being harder than that below the Giant Staircase, the cliff wall containing Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall. These three branches of each glacier combined to form one large glacier about [...] thick at maximum, stretching [...] downstream past the mouth of Yosemite Valley, well into Merced Canyon. These glaciers formed the granite cliffs that now constitute landmarks such as Half Dome, El Capitán, and Cloud's Rest.|$|E
