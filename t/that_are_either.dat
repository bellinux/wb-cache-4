South Streeterville currently has numerous skyscrapers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> proposed or already under construction such as a new tower at InterContinental Chicago and 500 North Lake Shore.|$|E

5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his slanted Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner. Earlier fonts that may have been cut by Garamond have been suggested but the attribution is less certain.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, homozygous for one gene variant, or homozygous for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> heterozygous for each gene variant or homozygous for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Many temnospondyls {{are much}} larger than living amphibians, and superficially {{resemble}} crocodiles. Others are smaller and resemble salamanders. Most have broad, flat heads <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>either</b> blunt (brevirostrine) or elongated (longirostrine). The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above, and are usually covered in pits and ridges. The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels, which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood (early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land, and these dermal bones {{may have been an}} early solution to the problem). Many temnospondyls also have canal-like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci. The sulci, which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets, are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water. As semiaquatic animals, most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot. Terrestrial temnospondyls have larger, thicker limbs, and some even have claws. One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl, Fayella, has relatively long limbs for its body, and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey.|$|E

A single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) configuration is considered, and the transition from low supersonic speeds to orbital speeds is studied for a single aerodynamic model (GHAME) and three engine models. Four optimization problems are solved using the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm for optimal control problems: (1) minimization {{of the weight of}} fuel consumed; (2) minimization of the peak dynamic pressure; (3) minimization of the peak heating rate; and (4) minimization of the peak tangential acceleration. The above optimization studies are carried out for different combinations of constraints, specifically: initial path inclination <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>either</b> free or given; dynamic pressure <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>either</b> free or bounded; and tangential acceleration <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>either</b> free or bounded...|$|R
