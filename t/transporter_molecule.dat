50|$|Schistosomes, {{another type}} of endoparasite, also live inside {{the body of the}} host but instead these parasites acquire their {{nutrients}} from host blood. Schistosomes are in direct contact with host blood, a rich source of amino acids, and they therefore do not require penetrative structures to reach host nutrients. Schistosomes take blood up through the negative pressure created by muscle contractions of their sucker and oesophagus. They obtain amino acids from host blood through a mechanism of haemoglobin degradation, which remains unresolved but is suggested to involve a series of proteases. Mechanisms to overcome blood clotting are also employed. Various studies have attempted to characterise the components of the schistosome tegument, including <b>transporter</b> <b>molecules</b> suggested to be involved in nutrient uptake.

However, the functional implication of this oligomerization remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the engineering of a Zn 2 + binding site at the predicted dimeric interface of the dopamine transporter (DAT) corresponding to the external end of transmembrane segment 6. Upon binding to this site, which involves a histidine inserted in position 310 (V 310 H) and the endogenous Cys 306 within the same DAT molecule, Zn 2 + potently inhibits [3 H]dopamine uptake.

However, to what degree local glutamate transporters affect these actions on a submicron scale remains poorly understood. Here we focus on hippocampal area CA 1, a common subject of synaptic physiology studies. First, we use a two-photon excitation technique to obtain an estimate of the apparent (macroscopic) extracellular diffusion coefficient for glutamate, ∼ 0. 32 μm 2 /ms. Second, we incorporate this measurement into a Monte Carlo model of the typical excitatory synapse and examine the influence of distributed glutamate <b>transporter</b> <b>molecules</b> on signal transmission. Combined with the results of whole-cell recordings, such simulations argue that, although glutamate transporters have little effect on the activation of synaptic α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, this does not rule out the occurrence of up to several dozens of transporters inside the cleft. We further evaluate how the expression pattern of <b>transporter</b> <b>molecules</b> (on the 10 – 100 nm scale) affects the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or metabotropic glutamate receptors in the synaptic vicinity. Finally, we extend our simulations to the macroscopic scale, estimating that synaptic activity sufficient to excite principal neurons could intermittently raise extracellular glutamate to ∼ 1 μM only at sparse (microns apart) hotspots. Greater rises of glutamate occur only when < 5 % of transporters are available (for instance, when an astrocyte fails). The results provide a quantitative framework for {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between glutamate transporters and glutamate receptor signaling...|$|R

The findings result from an analysis of unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulation trajectories (totaling> 14 μs) of the hDAT molecule immersed in lipid membrane environments with or without phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PIP 2) lipids. The N-terminal region of hDAT (N-term) is shown to have an essential mechanistic role in correlated rearrangements of specific structural motifs relevant to state-to-state transitions in the hDAT.

Furthermore, an involvement of efflux transporters such as P-glycoproteins, multidrug resistance associated protein 2, and breast cancer resistance protein as the intestinal absorption barrier and/or intestinal luminal secretion mechanisms has been demonstrated. However, {{although there are many}} suggestions for the contribution of uptake/influx transporters in intestinal absorption of drugs, information on the <b>transporter</b> <b>molecules</b> responsible for the intestinal absorptive process is limited. Among them, most studied absorptive drug transporter is peptide transporter PEPT 1. However, utilization of PEPT 1 for oral delivery of drugs may not be high due to the chemical structural requirement of PEPT 1 limited to peptide-mimetics. Recently, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family such as OATP 1 A 2 and OATP 2 B 1 has been suggested to mediate intestinal absorption of several drugs. Since OATPs exhibit species difference in expressed tissues and functional properties between human and animals, human studies are essential to clarify the intestinal absorption mechanisms of drugs via OATPs. Recent pharmacogenomic studies demonstrated that OATP 2 B 1 is involved in the drug absorption in human. In addition, information of drug-juice interaction in the intestine also uncovered the contribution of OATP 1 A 2 and OATP 2 B 1 in drug absorption. Since OATP 1 A 2 and OATP 2 B 1 exhibit broader substrate selectivity compared with PEPT 1, their potential to be applied for oral delivery should be high. In this review, current understanding of characteristics and contribution as the absorptive transporters of OATPs in small intestine in human is described. Now, it is getting clearer that OATPs have significant roles in intestinal absorption of drugs, therefore, there are higher possibility to utilize OATPs as the tools for oral delivery. © 2011 Elsevier B.

In psoriasis, two clinical subtypes analogous to the situation in diabetes type I with early onset and family history and type II with later onset and without family history have been described. We have previously shown that type I but not type II psoriasis is associated with the HLA-DRB 1 * 0701 / 2, -DQA 1 * 0201, -DQB 1 * 0303 haplotype.

S-IgA/SC, IgA 1 /SC and IgA 2 /SC ratios were calculated to assess the differential effects of stress on immunoglobulin transport versus availability. This study involved 113 university students, in part selected on high scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale and/or the Beck Depression Inventory. Stress levels were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Unstimulated saliva was collected and analysed for total S-IgA and its subclasses, as well as SC and total salivary protein. Multiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for gender, age, health behaviours, and concentration effects (total protein) revealed that higher perceived stress was associated {{with lower levels of}} IgA 1 but not IgA 2. Perceived stress, loneliness and depressive symptoms were all associated with lower IgA 1 /SC ratios. Surprisingly, higher SC levels were associated with loneliness and depressive symptoms, indicative of enhanced transport activity, which explained a lower IgA 1 /SC ratio (loneliness and depression) and IgA 2 /SC ratio (depression). This is the first study to investigate the effects of protracted psychological stress across S-IgA subclasses and its transporter SC. Psychological stress was negatively associated with secretory immunity, specifically IgA 1.

Resistance to this peptide and another toxic peptide derivative, {{which is based on}} a Thr-His-Thr-Nle-Glu-Gly backbone conjugated to butyl and benzyl groups (4 A 6), could be reversed by MRP 1 inhibitors. The reduced toxicity of 4 A 6 in MRP 1 -overexpressing cells was found to be associated with lower accumulation of a fluorescein-labeled derivative of this peptide. Glutathione (GSH) depletion had a clear effect on resistance to ALLN but hardly affected 4 A 6 resistance. In a limited structure-activity study using peptides that are analogous to 4 A 6, MRP 1 -overexpressing cells were found to be resistant to these peptides as well. Remarkably, when selecting A 2780 ovarian cancer cells for resistance to ALLN, {{even in the absence of}} Pgp blockers, resulting cell lines had up-regulated MRP 1, rather than any of the other currently known multidrug resistance transporter molecules including Pgp, MRP 2 (ABCC 2), MRP 3 (ABCC 3), MRP 5 (ABCCS), and the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG 2. ALLN-resistant, MRP 1 -overexpressing cells were found to be cross-resistant to 4 A 6 and the classical multidrug resistance drugs doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide.

By inserting {{a variety of different}} amino acid spacers between the two binding domains, we showed that retroviruses can potentially use the targeted cell surface receptor Pit- 2, the ecotropic retroviral receptor mCAT- 1, or both receptors cooperatively for entry into target cell (S.

An extreme example of receptor cooperativity was encountered when envelopes with specific proline-rich interdomain spacers (PRO spacers) were tested: both receptors had to be coexpressed at the surface of the targeted cells to cooperatively allow infection. Here, we characterized the role of PRO spacer in the cooperation of receptors. We have shown that the particular organization of the PRO spacer—a β-turn polyproline—was responsible for the cooperative effect. In the native configuration of the viruses, the structure masked the regions located downstream of the PRO spacer, thus the mCAT- 1 BD. After interaction with the targeted Pit- 2 receptor, the BD of the backbone envelope became accessible, and we demonstrated that interaction between the mCAT- 1 BD and the mCAT- 1 receptor is absolutely necessary.

Nramp 1 mRNA stability was greater in Nramp 1 (Gly 169) macrophages than in Nramp 1 (Asp 169) macrophages. The increase in Nramp 1 mRNA stability in resistant macrophages was inhibited by antioxidants and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, suggesting that Nramp 1 mRNA stability is regulated by an oxidant-generated signalling pathway that requires PKC activity. This was corroborated by treating Nramp 1 (Asp 169) macrophages with menadione, which generates reactive oxygen species within cells. Menadione increased Nramp 1 mRNA stability to the level observed in resistant macrophages; this increase was also inhibited by a PKC inhibitor.

Disrupting this complex abrogates the functional coupling of cAMP transporter activity to CFTR function. Mrp 4 knockout mice are more prone to CFTR-mediated secretory diarrhea. Our findings have important implications for disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and secretory diarrhea...|$|R
