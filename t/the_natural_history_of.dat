A calibration curve relating the degree of allele fragment sharing in individuals to relatedness in a captive pedigree of cheetahs is presented. This measurement has important applications for management of potential matings in captive management situations...|$|R

5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook <b>The</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Borneo shark.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time {{it had not been}} seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form {{about a quarter of}} his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|At present, the {{building}} houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum.

Its exhibits showcase <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> New Jersey; focusing geology, paleontology, and anthropology. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from Franklin and Ogdensburg, a mastodon from Salem County, a dinosaur trackway discovered in Towaco, and a Ptolemaic era Egyptian mummy.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks on <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the expedition, {{now known as}} The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence}} of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon <b>the</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
