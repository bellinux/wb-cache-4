5|$|In 1086, {{when the}} Domesday Book was compiled, England had a {{population}} of two million. About 10% lived in urban areas. By 1801, the population was 8.3million, and by 1901 30.5million. Due in particular to the economic prosperity of South East England, it has received many economic migrants from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom. There has been significant Irish migration. The proportion of ethnically European residents totals at 87.50%, including Germans and Poles.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire {{since the early}} 12th century, Oldham was recorded in 1212 as being one of five parts of the thegnage estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of King John by Roger de Montbegon and William de Nevill. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> this estate were Crompton, Glodwick, Sholver, and Werneth.

Five of the eight major national highways of Bangladesh start from the city. They are- N1, N2, N3, N5 and N8. Dhaka is also directly connected to two longest routes of Asian Highway Network- AH1 and AH2, {{as well as to}} AH41 route. Highway links to the Indian cities of Kolkata, Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong have been established by the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and private bus companies which also run regular international bus services to those cities from Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Madonna was {{shooting}} for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the song.|$|E

A torso and a pair each of arms and legs were found along Bahn Nai Trang Road, 9.7kilometres (6mi) away, five days later. The body parts were so badly decomposed that visual identification was impossible; Royal Thai Police used dental records to identify the skulls and forensic analysis concluded that the torso, arms, and legs {{were likely to be}} Sheila's. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Darin's body were never found.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper {{publishing}} in Mysore {{started in}} 1859 when Bhashyam Bhashyacharya began publishing a weekly newspaper in Kannada called the Mysooru Vrittanta Bodhini, {{the first of}} a number of weekly newspapers published in the following three decades. A well-known Mysore publisher during Wodeyar rule was M. Venkatakrishnaiah, known as the father of Kannada journalism, who started several news magazines. Many local newspapers are published in Mysore and carry news mostly related to the city and its surroundings, and national and regional dailies in English and Kannada are available, as in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the state. Sudharma, the only Indian daily newspaper in Sanskrit, is published in Mysore.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E

After killing Jaworski, Dexter drives to see Rita, but is sidetracked when he sees a refrigerated truck. Dexter follows the truck, and the driver throws a severed head at Dexter's car. When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the freezer, he finds <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|The Augustus {{opened in}} 2005 with 949 rooms, which were {{designed}} for more upscale luxury and service than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the resort. It is accessed through a private small lobby separate from the main Caesars' entrance. The rooms feature 9-foot ceilings with hotel chambers beginning at about , and going up to 2470 square feet for the largest suites. All feature spa tubs and televisions in the bathrooms. One {{of the highlights of}} the space is that the rooms view the Garden of the Gods pool area. On {{the second floor of the}} tower is a spa containing Roman baths of hot, cold and lukewarm pools; relaxing chaise longues sculpted of stone, which are underwater in the heated pool; and 51 separate therapy rooms. This tower, along with the Octavius Tower, forms a part of the 'Laurel Collection', Caesars boutique experience on the property. It features private elevator banks and exclusive Laurel Collection key cards.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure the mobility {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} again delayed by {{two weeks to}} January 25, 2013 in the United States and Canada. A {{statement}} from Paramount suggested that the film was delayed to enable it {{to be released in}} IMAX 3D format. In early January 2013, illegal copies of the film were discovered in a major anti-piracy bust. Prior to its North American premiere, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was first released in Russia on January 17, followed by the releases in Indonesia and the Philippines on January 23, and in several nations across Latin America and South-East Asia on January 24. On the same day (January 25) it was also released in more countries of Latin America, with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the world following between January 31 and mid-March 2013. The film was also released in the motion effects theaters using 4DX and D-Box motion enhancement technologies.

5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main cusps are about as high as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the crown, {{as they are in}} Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result of wear in adults. The two cusps on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps, is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior cusps, the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the back margin of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the back margin.|$|E
