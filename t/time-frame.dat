5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up a locomotive and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute <b>time-frame</b> Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that <b>time-frame.</b> He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s <b>time-frame</b> which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
5|$|The SSR Abkhazia was an {{ethnically diverse}} region. The {{demographics}} of Abkhazia shifted considerably {{in the decades}} following its annexation by Russia. Large numbers of ethnic Abkhaz had been deported {{in the late nineteenth}} century, with up to 100,000 expelled, mainly sent to the Ottoman Empire. The result was that by the time the SSR Abkhazia was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30% of the population (55,918), which numbered 201,016 according to the 1926 Soviet census, the only census conducted during the existence of the SSR Abkhazia. The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same <b>time-frame,</b> the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were Armenians (25,677, or 12.7%), Greeks (14,045, or 7%), and Russians (12,553, or 6.2%).|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} is the last in a four-part series Health Care Through the ‘Lens of Risk’, which focuses on risk categorisation, valuing, expecting and <b>time-framing,</b> respectively, and has been {{published}} in 2012 - 2013. The present editorial introduces the issue of <b>time-framing</b> in relation to an interview-based article, a guest editorial and six articles reporting findings from empirical research. The central argument of the editorial concerns the increasing abstractness of time within modernity, which renders risk thinking possible and exists alongside shifting subjectivities regarding time, as futures are increasingly reflected upon. The meaning given to contingent futures intensifies experiences of time {{in relation to the}} future and, therefore, the present. This argument is then problematised through reference to empirical studies of more passive attitudes to risk and where future considerations are avoided altogether. Different ways in which past, present and future are related to one another are also considered. We explore these themes before introducing the original research articles, interview-based article and guest editorial in this issue. Each original article explores <b>time-framing</b> within a different context including drinking alcohol away from licensed premises, expecting a baby as an older first-time mother, living with an advanced-stage cancer diagnosis, caring for a close-relative as a young person, long-term self-hurting and the journey towards a skin cancer diagnosis. Each of these contexts can be considered ‘risky’, partially depending on the <b>time-framing</b> invoked. The common theme linking these papers is the analysis of how futures are envisaged and how different approaches to <b>time-framing</b> are fundamental to perceptions and experiences of risk and uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new service discipline, called the Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) {{queueing}} discipline, {{that can provide}} throughput, delay, delay jitter, and loss free guarantees in a connection-oriented packet-switching network. Previously proposed solutions are based on either a <b>time-framing</b> strategy, or a sorted priority queue mechanism. <b>Time-framing</b> schemes suffer from the dependencies that they introduce between the queueing delay and the granularity of bandwidth allocation; sorted priority queue {{may be difficult to}} implement. The proposed RCSP queueing discipline avoids both <b>time-framing</b> and sorted priority queue; it achieves flexibility in the allocation of delay and bandwidth, as well as simplicity of implementation. The key idea is to separate rate-control and delay-control functions {{in the design of the}} server. Applying this separation of functions will result in a class of service disciplines, of which RCSP is an instance. This research was supported by the National Sci [...] ...|$|R

In the long-run (20 -year periods), however, inequality has {{a negative effect on}} growth in poor countries, and a positive effect in rich ones. Finally, in the 37 -year period (1970 - 2007) higher inequality is associated with a lower rate of growth. Thus, while some (but not much) inequality is good for growth, the negative effect of inequality on growth becomes dominant over longer <b>time-frames...</b>|$|R

We use conflict-based learning and illegal state learning across <b>time-frames.</b> We also address issues in efficiently bounding the search space in a single timeframe and across <b>time-frames.</b> We analyze each of these techniques experimentally and demonstrate the advantages of each technique. We compare performance against a commercial sequential ATPG engine and VIS [13] on a set of standard benchmarks. I...|$|R
