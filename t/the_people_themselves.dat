And these were the very same people that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> would have chosen, had the election been allowed to them: Bezalel, the son of Uri, of the tribe of Judah, the grandson of Miriam, the sister of Moses, and Oholiab, file son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.|$|E
25|$|The Indonesian {{government}} set up {{a special}} agency for Aceh reconstruction, the Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR) headed by Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, a former Indonesian Minister. This agency had ministry level of authority and incorporated officials, professionals and community leaders from all backgrounds. Most of the reconstruction work was performed by local people using a mix of traditional methods and partial prefabricated structures, with funding coming from many international organizations and individuals, governments, and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

Other programs and services offered through the Squamish Nation include strong cultural components in their Health, Lands, and Education departments.|$|E
25|$|The majlis is {{also the}} means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written {{that members of the}} majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough {{knowledge}} to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.|$|E
25|$|In May 1964, Chiume {{looked forward}} to Malawi being {{organised}} with no opposition at all and claimed {{that there was nothing}} wrong with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> was not a dictatorship. By the time that many of the ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long term members.|$|E

25|$|Flavius Josephus {{mentions}} that Abraham confronts Nimrod {{and tells him}} face-to-face to cease his idolatry, whereupon Nimrod orders him {{burned at the stake}}. Nimrod has his subjects gather enough wood so as to burn Abraham in the biggest fire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit and Abraham is thrown into it, Abraham walks out unscathed. In Islam, it is debated whether the decision to have Ibrahim burned at the stake came from Nimrod and the temple priests or whether <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> became vigilantes and hatched the plan to have him burned at the stake.|$|E

They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends {{on a wide range}} of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they are sure of what <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> want.|$|E

25|$|Structurally, {{there are}} three {{significant}} pieces to the narrative, which does not flow in a strictly biographical manner. The novel opens with a statement of veracity, where the author claims to be writing no fiction and no pedantic history. She claims to be an eyewitness and to be writing without any embellishment or theme, relying solely upon reality. What follows is a description of Surinam itself and the South American Indians there. She regards the locals as simple {{and living in a}} golden age (the presence of gold in the land being indicative of the epoch of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves).</b> It is only afterwards that the narrator provides the history of Oroonoko himself and the intrigues of both his grandfather and the slave captain, the captivity of Imoinda, and his own betrayal. The next section is in the narrator's present; Oroonoko and Imoinda are reunited, and Oroonoko and Imoinda meet the narrator and Trefry. The third section contains Oroonoko's rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E

Morrison, proposed that he may have been a charismatic public face acting as an advocate on the proposals of advisors, or <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves.</b> According to King, by increasing the power of the people, the Athenians left themselves with no authoritative leader.

500|$|Americans {{have four}} basic ways of solving {{problems}} that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector– the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector– the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association. [...] Voluntary action {{is the most powerful}} of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own– voluntary action is the people's action. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, [...] "The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people."

During {{the course of the}} hearing, Chief Engineer La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Clarke discover that Ardra has a cloaked ship nearby, that she is indeed using technology to simulate magic, and that she is a known criminal. Picard has an away team led by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) take control of Ardra's ship, giving Picard control of Ardra's [...] "powers". He demonstrates the fraud and she is taken into custody by local authorities.

500|$|This {{led to the}} {{building}} of the first council housing estate in Gateshead. Alderman Hodkin laid the foundation stone on 27 October 1920; as work commenced the Alderman demonstrated the authority's concerns, telling the local newspaper that: [...] "we can build houses, but we cannot build homes. Only <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> can do that and I hope that the spirit of ‘esprit de corps’ will prevail and this will be a model estate" [...] Demand was highthere were 427 applicants for the first twenty eight houses builtand the council built further tracts of housing in a broad triangle between Sodhouse Bank, Ermine Crescent and The Avenue, although central government withdrew its promised funding.

500|$|Günter Beck, a {{lecturer}} for the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, compared Lisa's {{role in the}} episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be [...] "on the brave moral decision {{to stand up for}} principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa’s bravery is the impulse for the state’s representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' — her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>themselves</b> and in the individual’s capacity to realize development and democracy." ...|$|E
