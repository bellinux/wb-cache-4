It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the Sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant radio sources. In particular, some quasars are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across Earth. The technique is called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level. At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are Earth's nutation, rotation, atmospheric refraction, <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement</b> and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the solar corona. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic spectrum, whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this source of error.|$|E

40|$|Topography of the Apennines chain {{resulted}} from the combined action of <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> (related to thrusting and high-angle faulting), large-scale uplift and surface processes. In such mountainous settings, where strong erosion is often responsible for incomplete stratigraphic records of surface evolution of thrust belts, geomorphological analysis helps quantify these processes and {{provide a framework for}} interpreting the geologic history of these regions. We studied a 400 km 2 area of the Central-Southern Apennines, covering Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions, by means of morphostructural analysis. This sector of the chain emerged during the Lower Pliocene and suffered a long-lasting erosion. Our study reveals a high relief landscape dominated by high-standing, resistant carbonates forming structure-controlled landforms (morphosculptures), and valleys underlain by erodible siliciclastics. Quaternary deposits are few and scattered, and they give poor constraints for the recognition of ancient base-levels. However, this study defines and identifies several upland erosional surfaces (paleosurfaces) that may be linked to ancient base-levels. On the basis of cross-cut relationships between paleosurfaces and structural landforms, we outlined a possible long-term geomorphological evolution of the study area. Most of the local <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> in this sector of the chain took place during Miocene and Pliocene, by means of thrusting and strike-slip faulting, whereas only localized extensional tectonics occurred during Quaternary times. Since the Pliocene, differential erosion promoted exhumation of carbonates and deep incision of pre-existing erosional surfaces. This strong erosion can be related to a regional base-level lowering promoted by large-scale uplift of the axial sector of the Central-Southern Apennines...|$|R

While it can be shown that these methods are potentially suitable, the ages obtained are often beyond the range of historically recorded earthquakes, and it cannot be proved that the observed and dated events are related to a seismic event. Particularly this is true for the caves in central Switzerland, where most ages in the Melchsee-Frutt region were beyond the limits of the U/Th method, or of late Pleistocene age in the Siebenhengste-Hohgant region. A direct comparison with known historical (or prehistoric) earthquakes was not possible. In contrast to central Switzerland, the results in the Basle region of northern Switzerland indicates cave and speleothem damages in one cave within the epicentral area of the 1356 Basle earthquake. 14 C datings allowed to directly relate the speleothem damages to this M 6. 5 earthquake. Further dating results from caves in northern Switzerland on speleothems and organic material in cave deposits supplied ages which indicate older events not related to the historical Basle earthquake. The detection of active fault displacements and prehistoric strong earthquakes can only be achieved by a very careful deciphering of the palaeo-environmental records and many more age determinations which allow to separate active <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> and seismic events from other events not related to tectonics, i. e. glaciations, creep of sediments, catastrophic floods etc...|$|R

While much effort {{has been devoted to}} the development of LEMs that simulate a wide range of processes, the numerical accuracy of these models has received less attention. Most LEMs use first-order accurate numerical methods that suffer from substantial numerical diffusion. Numerical diffusion particularly affects the solution of the advection equation and thus the simulation of retreating landforms such as cliffs and river knickpoints. This has potential consequences for the integrated response of the simulated landscape. Here we test a higher-order flux-limiting finite volume method that is total variation diminishing (TVD-FVM) to solve the partial differential equations of river incision and <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement.</b> We show that using the TVD-FVM to simulate river incision significantly influences the evolution of simulated landscapes and the spatial and temporal variability of catchment-wide erosion rates.

For sites at which a stratigraphic or geomorphic marker of peak Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 e sea level exists, the standard approach for estimating local tectonic uplift (or subsidence) rates takes {{the difference between the}} elevation of the local highstand marker and a reference MIS 5 e eustatic value, commonly chosen as + 6 m, and divides by the age of the marker. The resulting rate is then applied to correct the elevation of all other local observed sea-level markers for <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement,</b> including peak highstands of different ages (e. g., MIS 5 a, MIS 5 c and MIS 11), under the assumption that the tectonic rate remained constant over those periods. This approach introduces two potentially significant errors. First, the peak eustatic value adopted for MIS 5 e in most previous studies (i. e., + 6 m) is likely incorrect. Second, local peak sea level during MIS 5 e is characterized by significant departures from eustasy due to glacial isostatic adjustment in response to both successive glacial–interglacial cycles and excess polar ice-sheet melt relative to present day values. We use numerical models of glacial isostatic adjustment that incorporate both of these effects to quantify the plausible range of the combined error and show that, even at sites far from melting ice sheets, local peak sea level during MIS 5 e may depart from eustasy by 2 – 4 m, or more. We also demonstrate that the associated error in the estimated tectonic rates can significantly alter previous estimates of peak eustatic sea level during Quaternary highstands, notably those associated with earlier interglacials (e. g., MIS 11) ...|$|E

The analysis of shear zone patterns in the Roffna granite reveals that the first deformation is well developed in the entire nappe; the second deformation, however, is more localized in the lower and upper parts. The bulk asymmetry of the shear zone patterns confirms the kinematics recorded by other Penninic nappes in this area: first a stacking of the nappe towards the NW, followed by the top to the E shearing during post-thickening extensional tectonics.

The goals of the thesis are 1) to understand the degree to which landscape morphology can be used to delineate breaks in rock uplift in active orogens; 2) to characterize the neotectonics of central Nepal using data representing varied temporal and spatial scales of inquiry; and 3) to move closer to understanding the dynamic interactions among climate, erosion and tectonics in a field setting. Analysis of digital topographic data from Nepal and other tectonically active settings demonstrates how breaks in the simple scaling characterizing river systems can be used to identify tectonic boundaries. (cont.) Limitations to these methods are illustrated by way of an example from the Eastern Central Range of Taiwan, but changes in landscape morphology become the foundation upon which further investigations are built for central Nepal. These investigations include data from detrital ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar thermochronology to characterize changes in exhumation rates at million-year timescales; cosmogenic ¹⁰Be to characterize changes in erosion rates at millennial timescales; and simple thermal modeling to evaluate a range of alternative tectonic geometries for central Nepal. The data point to the existence of a tectonically significant, thrust- sense shear zone at the base of the high Himalaya in central Nepal, nearly 100 km north of the active thrust front.

Observations of bathymetric features of the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment and identification of tectonic lineaments from geophysical mapping indicate that erosional processes of paleo-ice stream flows across the continental shelf followed such lineaments inherited from the tectonic history since the Cretaceous breakup between New Zealand and West Antarctica. East-west oriented basement trends correlate with coastline trends and overlay tectonic lineaments caused by former rift activities. Directional trends in northwest-southeast orientation are observed for the glacial troughs of the western embayment outer shelf, the western Pine Island Bay coastal zones, and the inner Pine Island glacial trough and are superposed on a distributed southern plate boundary zone of the former Bellingshausen Plate. The north-south trend of the main Pine Island glacial trough and the NNE-trend of the Abbot Ice Shelf trough follow the predicted lineation trend of an eastern branch of the West Antarctic Rift System extending from the Thwaites drainage basin northward into Pine Island Bay.

In a series of numerical experiments, we generate synthetic landscapes that closely resemble mountainous topography observed in the Basin and Range. The production of realistic landscapes depends critically on the presence of bedrock landslides, and landsliding yields rates of long-term erosion that are comparable in magnitude to those of fluvial erosion. The erosive efficiency of bedrock landsliding implies that hillslopes may respond very quickly to changes in local base level and that fluvial erosion is the rate-limiting process in steady state experimental landscapes, Our experiments generate power law distributions of landslide sizes, somewhat similar to both field and laboratory observations. Thus even a simple model of bedrock landsliding is capable of quantitatively reproducing mountainous topography and landslide distributions and represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the evolution of normal-fault-bounded ranges...|$|E

Both the original and a potential retrofit seismic isolation system designs are considered in the analyses. The results show double isolation system demands when fault crossing is considered, as compared to the case where fault crossing is ignored. The pier drift demands, however, remain comparable in both cases. Furthermore, the location of fault crossing along the bridge length, as well as the fault orientation with respect to the bridge longitudinal direction are shown to influence substantially the response of the seismically isolated bridge. Isolation system permanent displacements are greatly influenced by the restoring force capability of the isolation system when fault crossing effects in the excitations are ignored. In the case of fault crossing, the permanent displacements of the isolation system are dominated by the substantial permanent <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement</b> along the fault trace which is imposed upon the structure. The results of this study contribute to developing {{a better understanding of how}} seismically isolated bridges respond when traversed by fault rupture zones.

For each of the 246 listed sites, the accurate elevation of the high stand is defined through well-known markers. Coupled with a refined age assessment locally supported by new radiometric dating, these markers provide robust constraints on deformation. Significant alongshore differences in site elevation between + 175 and 125 m a. s. l. resulted from the interplay of regional and local tectonic processes, including faulting and volcanic deformation. Whereas most of Sardinia’s coasts and the northern Tyrrhenian Sea coasts are tectonically stable, the central Tyrrhenian Sea coasts display stable promontories, subsiding plains, and localized centres of weak uplift. Subsidence of the plains is related to extensional faulting locally enhanced by volcano-tectonic collapse, and weak uplift arising from magmatic processes. Rapid uplift of southern Calabria, northeast Sicily and the Jonian sea coasts probably reflects the extent of deep crustal delamination. The central Adriatic Sea shows weak thrust-related uplift, but foreland flexure in northern Adriatic and possibly southwestern Sicily results in locally intense regional subsidence. The rapidly uplifting regions are well correlated with the sectors of higher seismic release and surface horizontal motion documented by geodetic velocities. In this light, the MIS 5. 5 marker indicates with a relatively high spatial resolution the vertical component of <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement</b> and provides insight into the long-term tectonic processes of the Central Mediterranean orogen. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|Conglomeratic strata {{from middle}} Miocene {{sections}} {{in the central}} Resting Spring Range and nearby Eagle Mountain, California, contain a clast assemblage including marble, orthoquartzite, fusulinid grainstone, and coarse (∼ 1 m) monzogabbro, interstratified with tephras yielding laser-fusion ^(40) Ar/^(39) Ar ages of 11. 6, 13. 4, and 15. 0 Ma. Petrographic and geochronologic evidence ties the clast assemblage to a source area in the southern Cottonwood Mountains, California, > 100 km west-northwest of their present location. In the upper 100 m of the Resting Spring Range section, conglomerates are derived almost exclusively from the southern Cottonwoods source, and sandstone modes are as much as 50 % angular plagioclase derived from the monzogabbro. The lack of dilution of this detritus by other sources and sedimentary features in both sections indicate (1) that deposition occurred on an alluvial fan with a north- northeast paleoslope and (2) that transport of the gravels by sedimentary processes was probably < 20 km north-northeast, in a direction normal to the present azimuth to their source. Therefore, we interpret {{most or all of}} the net east-southeast transport as a result of extensional and strike-slip faulting between the Cottonwood Mountains and the Resting Spring Range since 11 – 12 Ma. Restoration of these deposits to a position 10 – 20 km north-northeast of the eastern margin of the monzogabbro source (east margin of the Hunter Mountain batholith) yields a net <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacement</b> of the Cottonwood Mountains relative to the Resting Spring Range of 104 km N 67 °W. This result confirms previous reconstructions based on the restoration of isopachs in the Cordilleran miogeocline, pre-Cenozoic structural features, and other proximal Tertiary deposits in the region...|$|E
40|$|Lake Vattern, Sweden, {{is within}} a graben that formed through rifting along the {{boundary}} between two Precambrian terrains. Geophysical mapping and geological coring show that substantial tectonic movements along the Lake Vattern graben occurred at the very onset of the Holocene. This is evident from deformation structures in the soft sediment accumulated on the lake floor. Our interpretation of these structures suggests as much as 13 m of vertical <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> along sections of a > 80 -km-long fault system. If these large displacements are from one tectonic event, Lake Vattern must have had an earthquake with seismic moment magnitudes to 7. 5. In addition, our geophysical mapping shows large landslides along sections of the steep lake shores. Pollen analysis of sediment infillings {{of some of the}} most prominent sediment deformation structures places this major seismic event at the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition, ca. 11. 5 ka. We suggest that this event is mainly related to the rapid release of ice-sheet load following the deglaciation. This paleoseismic event in Lake Vattern ranks among the larger known intraplate tectonic events in Scandinavia and attests to the significance of glacio-isostatic unloading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The late Quaternary {{sedimentology}} and palaeogeography of the Corinth Isthmus {{in central}} Greece is re-interpreted. A series of beach-to-shoreface sub-sequences are seen, each characteristi-cally having an overall fining-up character. These occur within a coastal facies belt which has prograded to the west. Computer modelling illustrates {{the interaction of}} <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> and eustatic sea-level variation as controls of facies patterns. Late Pleistocene-Holocene facies geometries are predicted {{on the basis of}} published sea-level data over that time interval. On coastlines undergoing tectonic uplift, such as the Isthmus of Corinth, depositional patterns may be characterized by transgressive wedges. These sub-sequences merge basinwards below sea-level minima. Each transgression relates to a major eustatic sea-level peak. Such first order models are modified by variations in the rate of tectonic deformation, the second control on relative sea-level position. Modelled facies patterns are tested on the basis of new 239 h/ 234 U dates obtained from sclerac-tinian corals of the Corinth canal area. Dated sub-sequence sediments correspond in age to late Pleistocene eustatic highs and observed facies patterns correlate with the major late Pleistocene-Holocene eustatic transgressions of c. 100 ka periodicity. Episodes of intrabasinal normal faulting ar...|$|R
40|$|Downhole {{magnetic}} field measurements {{were conducted in}} Hole 504 B on the Costa Rica Ridge during ODP Leg 111. Three magnetic groups within oceanic basement at this site are tentatively defined, based on the interval mean val ues of the downhole {{magnetic field}}. Statistical analyses show that there are {{significant differences in the}} inclinations of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) among the three magnetic groups. Although this could be caused by various factors, we explain the inclination difference among the three groups by simple <b>tectonic</b> <b>displacements</b> of basement by faulting after its formation, about 5. 9 Ma ago. Based on the intensities of NRM and inclinations measured in the base ment core samples drilled in Hole 504 B on DSDP Legs 69, 70, and 83 and ODP Leg 111, the investigated section of basement formation can be divided into three or four magnetic zones that parallel the zones defined by the downhole magnetic field, alteration, and lithology. Downhole magnetic field and paleomagnetic data generally correlate posi tively, in spite of some discrepancies. The magnetic susceptibility values of the core samples were used to derive the in-situ NRM from the downhole magnetic field data...|$|R
