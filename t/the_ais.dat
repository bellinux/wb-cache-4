5|$|Watts {{was born}} to Janine and Andrew Watts on 26 March 1991 in Victoria, Australia. He proved himself as an adept Australian rules footballer {{at a young age}} when he {{represented}} Victoria at the under-12 AFL carnival. An equally talented basketball player, he represented both Victoria and Australia as a junior, earning a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In 2007, he was rewarded with a second scholarship with <b>the</b> <b>AIS,</b> this time for football, as part of the eleventh intake of the AIS-AFL Academy. He missed playing in the 2007 AFL under-16 championships for Victoria Metro and most of the basketball season after he broke his collarbone twice. Despite attempting to play both basketball and football at an elite level, he ultimately gave up his basketball scholarship with <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> in mid-2008 to focus on a football career; at the time, he was considered the best point guard for his age in Victoria and potentially the best in the country.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Zagame {{was named}} in the 17-member {{training}} squad for the 2012 Summer Olympics, and attended a training camp that started on 20 February 2012 at the Australian Institute of Sport.

5|$|Jackson {{was offered}} a {{scholarship}} with <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> in 1996, {{when she was just}} 15, but her parents said no to this, as it required her to move from Albury to Canberra. The next year, she accepted a scholarship. The programme considers her one of its success stories. With Jackson leading a side composed of the best 16- to 17-year-old development players in the country, the Australian Institute of Sport WNBL team won the WNBL Championship.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} assessment {{was made of}} Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) data for discriminating and characterizing vegetation in a semiarid environment. May and October AIS data sets were acquired over a large alluvial fan in eastern California, on which were found Great Basin desert shrub communities. Maximum likelihood classification of a principal components representation of <b>the</b> May <b>AIS</b> data enabled discrimination of subtle spatial detail in images relating to vegetation and soil characteristics. The spatial patterns in <b>the</b> May <b>AIS</b> classification were, however, too detailed for complete interpretation with existing ground data. A similar analysis of <b>the</b> October <b>AIS</b> data yielded poor results. Comparison of AIS results with a similar analysis of May Landsat Thematic Mapper data showed that <b>the</b> May <b>AIS</b> data contained approximately {{three to four times}} as much spectrally coherent information. When only two shortwave infrared TM bands were used, results were similar to those from AIS data acquired in October...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} test an online {{assessment}} {{referred to as}} the ASTHMA-CAT (computerized adaptive testing), a patient-based asthma impact, control, and generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional pilot study of the ASTHMA-CAT 2 ̆ 7 s administrative feasibility in a disease management population. METHODS: The ASTHMA-CAT included a dynamic or static Asthma Impact Survey (AIS), Asthma Control Test, and SF- 8 Health Survey. A sample of clinician-diagnosed adult asthmatic patients (N = 114) completed the ASTHMA-CAT. Results were used to evaluate administrative feasibility of the instrument and psychometric performance of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>AIS</b> relative to <b>the</b> static <b>AIS.</b> A prototype aggregate (group-level) report was developed and reviewed by care providers. RESULTS: Online administration of the ASTHMA-CAT was feasible for patients in disease management. <b>The</b> dynamic <b>AIS</b> functioned well compared with <b>the</b> static <b>AIS</b> in preliminary studies evaluating response burden, precision, and validity. Providers found reports to be relevant, useful, and applicable for care management. CONCLUSION: The ASTHMA-CAT may facilitate asthma care management...|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de León is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} <b>the</b> <b>Ais</b> and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between <b>the</b> <b>Ais</b> and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when the child of a cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether accountability structures and managerial characteristics/traits {{are associated with}} clinical managers’ perceptions of accounting information systems (AISs). We undertake this study in Italian hospitals and include a sample of clinical managers. Our sample includes only public hospitals but they operate under different structural arrangements. We assess if clinical managers from the {{two different types of}} structures differ in perceptions of AISs. We also assess whether different specializations perceive <b>the</b> <b>AISs</b> differently. Given clinical specialization has been demonstrated to reflect different attitudes and behaviors we use this as a proxy for ‘managerial characteristics’ and assess whether attitudes of clinical managers to <b>AISs</b> differs between <b>the</b> specializations. Our results partially support our expectations. Clinical managers’ perceptions of <b>AISs</b> adaptability in <b>the</b> two different structures only differs for those dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>AISs</b> that are patient centric. We also find support for our expectations that surgeons perceptions of AISs is significantly lower than other types of clinical managers...|$|R

25|$|Over the summer, the {{original}} experimental set {{was used in}} a series of experiments against submarines. The first took place on 30 April 1941 against HMS Sea Lion, and a second on 10–12 August against ORP Sokół. These clearly demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> could indeed detect the submarines with only the conning tower exposed, just as the Admiralty had hoped. This led to orders for Air-Surface Vessel radars based on <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> internals.|$|E
25|$|By {{having a}} single source of information, pilot {{workload}} should {{be reduced by}} removing the possibility of conflicting data {{and the need for}} cross-checking, improving situational awareness and increasing systems automation. In practice <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> should allow the Eurofighter to identify targets at distances in excess of 150nm and acquire and auto-prioritise them at over 100nm. In addition <b>the</b> <b>AIS</b> offers the ability to automatically control emissions from the aircraft, so called EMCON (from EMissions CONtrol). This should aid in limiting the detectability of the Typhoon by opposing aircraft further reducing pilot workload.|$|E
