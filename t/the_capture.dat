5|$|Byng {{commanded}} four attacking divisions, one {{division of}} reserves and numerous support units. He was supported {{to the north}} by the 24th British Division of I Corps, which advanced north of the Souchez river and by the advancing XVII Corps to the south. The 4th Canadian Division {{was responsible for the}} northern portion of the advance that included <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of the highest point of the ridge followed by the heavily defended Pimple just west of the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle. The 3rd Canadian Division was responsible for the narrow central section of the ridge, including <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of La Folie Farm. The 2nd Canadian Division, which later included an additional brigade from the 5th British Division, was directly south of 3rd Canadian Division and entrusted with <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of the village of Thélus. The 1st Canadian Division was responsible for the broad southern sector of the corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance. Byng planned for a healthy reserve for contingencies that included the relief of forward troops, help in consolidating positions and aiding the 4th Canadian Division with <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of the Pimple. As a result, the 9th Canadian Brigade, 15th British Brigade and 95th British Brigade were kept in corps-level reserve.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system {{with a number of}} Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|Lowestoffe {{remained}} in the area, supporting British operations against the French garrisons on Corsica during 1794. On 7 March 1794 Captain Charles Cunningham took over command from Wolsely. A little over a month later, on 13 April Lowestoffe captured the Etoile du Nord. , Aimable and Imperieuse shared in <b>the</b> <b>capture.</b> Lowestoffe then was among the British warships that shared in <b>the</b> <b>capture,</b> on 24 May, of the French brigs Jacobin and Natine.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{mutagenic}} or lethal {{effects of}} ionization radiation {{can be attributed}} to damage caused to the DNA by low-energy electrons. To gain insight on the parameters affecting this process, we measured the low-energy electron (< 2 eV) transmission yield through self-assembled monolayers of short DNA oligomers. The electrons that are not transmitted are <b>captured</b> by <b>the</b> layer. Hence, the transmission reflects <b>the</b> <b>capturing</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> electrons by the layer. The dependence of <b>the</b> <b>capturing</b> probability on <b>the</b> base sequence was studied, as was the state of <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> electrons. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>capturing</b> probability scales with the number of G bases in the single-stranded oligomers and depends on their clustering level. Using two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that, once <b>captured,</b> <b>the</b> electrons do not reside on the bases. Rather, the state of <b>the</b> <b>captured</b> electrons is insensitive to the sequence of the oligomer. Double-stranded DNA does not capture electrons as efficiently as single-stranded oligomers; however, once <b>captured,</b> <b>the</b> electrons are bound more strongly than to the single strands...|$|R

40|$|In {{the optical}} communication, the {{choosing}} scanning style {{is important for}} the optical communication, because the illuminating laser beam is narrow and the communication range is long. In this study, three typical scanning styles of raster scan, spiral scan and square spiral scan are compared with each other. The characteristics of the scanning styles are introduced. The numerical simulation model is built. <b>The</b> <b>capturing</b> time at <b>the</b> same condition is computed. <b>The</b> <b>capturing</b> time is affected by the scanning interval and the scanning area. In the same scanning area and scanning interval, <b>the</b> <b>capturing</b> time of raster scan is the biggest one and <b>the</b> <b>capturing</b> time of <b>the</b> square spiral scan is the smallest one...|$|R

5|$|Anarawd's brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, {{took over}} {{as head of the}} family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen castle in 1145 then began a {{campaign}} to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals {{for the first time in}} 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, and left for dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.|$|E
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than <b>the</b> <b>capture</b> of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
