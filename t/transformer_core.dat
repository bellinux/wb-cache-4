2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the <b>transformer</b> <b>core,</b> operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E

5000|$|Eddy {{currents}} {{are produced}} in the metal <b>transformer</b> <b>core</b> and cause heating of the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.
