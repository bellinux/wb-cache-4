25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile <b>table</b> and <b>clamped</b> in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|R

40|$|A {{retractor}} support {{consisting of}} an inverted L-rod, {{fastened to the}} operating <b>table</b> with a <b>clamp,</b> can be applied {{in a variety of}} ways to maintain retraction more conveniently and reliably in some circumstances than a human assistant. Through universal joints and connecting rods it can be quickly adjusted to hold a Weinberg retractor, a BiBall retainer, a rectangular frame for multidirectional retraction in vascular repair, or a ribbon retractor for herniotomy, pneumonectomy and lobectomy. By freeing the assistant this device can shorten operating time and permit cumbersome procedures to be accomplished by a surgeon and one assistant with less operative trauma...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the additional table {{that serves as}} a table that has a larger surface area for table arm chair. Students often use tables arm chair, but table is usually in the design space with a limited surface. It is often used, especially in the classroom and lecture halls. In addition, the table arm chair is furniture that is used to facilitate reading and writing. This report will also be more focused on the formation of additional table expansion. Additional ways to use this <b>table</b> to <b>clamp</b> attached onto the table arm chair. Materials used to produce a table expansion are to use steel and wood. The purpose of this table expansion is designed to make the table arm chairs have enough space by using the installation. Ways and forms an attractive installation designed to make this easy to use a table expansion. Several aspects should be given full attention to ensure that this project can be carried out in line with the initial planning and be completed within the time supposed...|$|R
5000|$|After {{a line of}} type was {{assembled}} {{into the}} stick a special blocking slug was inserted to seal the end. Then the stick was placed mold side down into the slot on the <b>table,</b> a <b>clamp</b> locked down to securely hold the stick and the Ludlow activated. The plunger would snap down into the pot with considerable force, injecting molten type metal into the mold at {{a high rate of}} speed to ensure the mold was filled before the metal solidified. If the stick was not properly filled out or mounted firmly, or the special terminating block was forgotten, a dreaded [...] "splash" [...] would result, often encasing the operator's toes in molten lead and leaving a mess that needed to be peeled off the Ludlow surfaces. Operators were encouraged to wear heavy boots with steel toes and be quick at removing one. It was also not uncommon for some of the type metal to be projected up onto the ceiling, no matter the height. As with the Linotype / Intertype machines, the Ludlow machines were often fitted with metal feeders to keep the pot filled to optimum level.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of electrical appliances is highly debated topic at present. This topic is transferred especially in industries {{where are the}} effects of savings much more significant due to higher energy consumption. In the case of machine tools is at present energy efficiency also a hot topic, based on the Kyoto Protocol and the European Commission Regulation of energy appliances eco-design. Machine tool manufacturers already responses to this situation by using more efficient components (motors, pumps, etc…). This article focuses especially on determining the energy profile of the machine tool at the moment where the machine is not manufactured. It is used a method allows to simulate the energy profile of the machine tool. This is verified by measurement on the test device. Realized measurement was done under different loads of <b>clamping</b> <b>table</b> and under different feed rates. Average percentual error was achieved below ten percent limit...|$|R
40|$|Background: W e present our {{experience}} of sutureless and bloodless elective circumcision in neonates and infants with Gomco clamp. Patients and Methods: From March 2008 to May 2011, 200 babies with age ranging from 2 weeks to 7 months underwent Gomco circumcision. All patients were given chlorohydrate 50 mg/kg, paracetamol suppository 15 mg/kg, and local anesthesia. Procedure was done in minor operation theatre (OT) and babies were observed for 1 h in recovery room before discharging them home. Results: Two of our patients (1 %) required immediate suturing on <b>table</b> after Gomco <b>clamp</b> was removed, five patients (2. 5 %) were shifted back from the recovery room to minor OT for suture repair and eight patients (4 %) required reinforcement of primary dressing to control the minor ooze. There was no other complication. Cosmesis was {{to the satisfaction of}} the surgeon as well as the parents. Conclusion: Gomco clamp is a bloodless, sutureless, simple, and safe method of circumcision in newborns and infants. It is cost-effective and can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation with excellent cosmetic results...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{was carried}} out to {{investigate}} the characteristic of Acoustic Emission signal on galvanized iron MIG welding. The welding joint will be test as a load {{and there will be}} a few points of welding joint to be monitoring. For the study AE signal on galvanized iron, all time domain parameter (hit, count, amplitude, and frequency by Fast Fourier Transform) of signal will be observe and process with the aid of Matlab software. The data was taken by the specimen tight at the edge of the <b>table</b> by using <b>clamp.</b> The sensor located at the point and after that the load was applied to enhance the signal of Acoustic Emission. All parameter compared with different points of welding joints. The result obtain will be analyse by using Matlab and then can proceed for analysis. For result by using FFT, the signal pattern can be distinguish between non-defect welding joint and defect welding joint due to the frequency range show a different between them. For the amplitude and count, the average value of defect welding joint shows that it has higher value compare to non-defect welding joint. There are some signals that influence by disturbance noise. Hence, the signal pattern obtain could not be analyse. The factor that influence the signal or disturbance signal is noise around the test run, emission from electric surrounding and from people talking...|$|R
40|$|Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) {{has proven}} to be {{beneficial}} in reducing recovery time, infection, and post-operative pain, but is inherently difficult due to the constraint of a single incision. The difficulties can be mitigated by using in vivo robots that can be inserted through the incision, with multiple arms and a vision system used to accomplish surgical tasks. Once the robot is inserted, it needs to be positioned so that it can focus on the target surgical site. Currently, this is accomplished manually with a <b>table</b> mounted support <b>clamp.</b> This thesis outlines the motivation, design, and evaluation of a proposed 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) gross positioning arm built to provide automated orientation control of an in vivo surgical robot, enabling it to reach any quadrant of the abdomen without having to stop the procedure and reorient the robot, while also providing enough force and torque to hold the robot steady during surgery. The proposed design is much smaller than current gross positioning arms, which reduces crowding over the patient, while also providing intuitive control to the surgeon. In particular, this thesis proposes a novel control scheme, which provides control of the system without changing control modes. Experimental results from a standard peg-transfer test show the proposed design is capable of operating in all quadrants, while maintaining the stability of the in vivo robot, providing smooth motion as the surgeon operates. Experiments performed by a surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical Center showed the system provided intuitive control while accessing all necessary quadrants for surgery.
