5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The Three Sisters, opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The Three Sisters before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The Three Sisters was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E
500|$|In 1927–28, {{at the end}} of {{the silent}} era, the {{production}} cost of an average feature from a major Hollywood studio ranged from $190,000 at Fox to $275,000 at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. That average reflected both [...] "specials" [...] that might cost as much as [...] and films made quickly for around $50,000. These cheaper films (not yet called B movies) allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel. Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as Columbia Pictures and Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), focused on exactly <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> cheap productions. Their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs, particularly small-town and urban neighborhood venues, or [...] "nabes". Even smaller production houses, known as Poverty Row studios, made films whose costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.|$|E
2500|$|Coville {{began his}} love of books as a child, reading [...] "Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and zillions of comic books". [...] He read [...] "books that made [...] laugh, but also made [...] shiver in terror." [...] Wanting to impart <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> feeling to others is what spurred {{his love of}} writing. [...] Coville {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer by his mid-teens, and by age 19 he [...] "never looked back." [...] His first novel, The Foolish Giant, was {{published}} in 1977.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, indeed," [...] said Supplehouse; [...] "as {{he always}} does <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. No man makes so good an {{explanation}} of circumstances, or comes out with so telling a personal statement. He ought to keep himself in reserve for <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pish!' said Lord Cadurcis, {{turning away}} and laughing, 'I have left off growing, Pauncefort, and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} which I like best; this, or my own place at Boxall Hill. You have the {{advantage}} here in trees, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. But, as to the house, why, my box there is very comfortable, very. You'd hardly know the place now, Lady Arabella, if you haven't seen it since my governor bought it. How {{much do you think}} he spent about the house and grounds, pineries included, you know, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Onstad remarked in an {{interview}} that [...] "You can't help but be affected by Mark Twain books, Lay's Potato Chip ads, a fat lady who is yelling outside, David Letterman, etc." [...] And elsewhere, to Brian M. Palmer, [...] "The reader would likely be a better judge." [...] He has expressed admiration for Chris Ware and Tony Millionaire. He has also claimed to be influenced by [...] "Bryson, Barry, Twain, Elton, Wodehouse, Adams, Vonnegut, John Irving, Arthur Conan Doyle, Jack Handey, Al Franken, that sort of thing. <b>Those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> guys. Tina Fey. Aaron Sorkin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by Wolf Blitzer if {{he would}} ever support the efforts of Dennis Kucinich to cut funding for the war, Webb said, [...] "I – you know, I lived through Vietnam. I lived through it as a Marine and I know that <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> approaches, while they seem {{attractive}} on one level are really not that realistic. What {{we want to do}} – and I was talking with a number of senators today – is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Shermer, who {{considers}} himself {{an admirer of}} Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's [...] "heavy-hammer approach" [...] with the [...] "big-tent approach" [...] of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: [...] "If we're close enough {{on the same page}} about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I guess it was <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> judgments made by some Objectiv that I objected to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you know, mother--she's--she's {{different}} from us. <b>Those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> people, like <b>those</b> she lives amongst, they don't {{seem to have}} the same principles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Have you any band {{instruments}} of an easy nature to play?” demanded the Chief Organiser of the Prison Governor; “drums, cymbals, <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{keep your}} mouth shut, my dear. You'll learn all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things in time, and nobody notices it if you don't say anything." ...|$|R
2500|$|A major study {{published}} more recently in Nature Nanotechnology suggests {{some forms of}} carbon nanotubes – a poster child for the [...] "nanotechnology revolution" [...] – could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said [...] "We {{know that some of}} them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma. So <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> materials need to be handled very carefully." [...] In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1999, Schutz instigated the Maverick imprint at Dark Horse Comics {{which was}} {{designed}} as an umbrella title {{for a number of}} creator-owned titles, including some already published by Dark Horse and some new to the publisher. The 'Maverick' name was designed [...] "to provide a kind of identity or specific line for <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> individual creator visions." [...] The aim of the [...] "Maverick" [...] line was to [...] "push the medium a little bit," [...] although Schutz recognized that such titles are often a hard sell. To help address this, the Maverick Annual anthologies (published from 2000 as Dark Horse Maverick and later under such subtitles as Happy Endings and AutobioGraphix) placed newer creators (Farel Dalrymple, Gilbert Austin, Jason Hall, Matt Kindt) alongside the more established names of Frank Miller and Sam Kieth.|$|E
2500|$|The bill {{divided and}} engendered a {{long-term}} {{change in the}} demographic support of both parties. President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for {{the introduction of the}} civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that [...] "I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> states may be lost anyway." [...] Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill [...] "will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election". Johnson, however, {{went on to win the}} 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{be awfully}} fond <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> people," [...] said Lord Lambeth one day, as if the idea had just {{occurred}} to him.|$|R

6000|$|... "I know he's a big-bug and all that," [...] he explained, [...] "but you {{can never}} tell what <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> notions <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> men take into their heads to live in, anyways." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jordan quickly {{produced}} some initial script drafts, which Featherstone {{took to the}} BBC; Gareth Neame, Head of Drama Commissioning, rapidly approved a six-part series. Featherstone assembled a production team that had considerable overlap with the Spooks crew, including Simon Crawford Collins as producer and Matthew Graham as co-writer. In creating the first episodes, Jordan drew inspiration from the long tradition of confidence tricks and heists in Hollywood and television, including The A-Team, The Sting and The Grifters (and in a similar vein, the films and TV series of Mission Impossible). Featherstone remarked that [...] "Ocean's Eleven was on around the time Bharat and I first spoke, and I think it helped to inspire us, but really we took our inspiration from a whole catalogue of movies and books... {{we wanted to make}} something that had the energy, verve, style and pure entertainment value of <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> films" [...] At the same time, the writers attempted to draw on the success of recent blockbusters such as Ocean's Eleven and speaking in an interview in December 2003, Crawford explained that [...] " [...] worked because of the interaction within the group – the plotlines were almost irrelevant".|$|E
6000|$|... “None of my {{children}} have been brought up to play card games,” said Mrs. Eggelby; “draughts and halma and <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> games I encourage. Eric is considered quite a wonderful draughts-player.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} been expecting it," [...] said Lady St Julians. [...] "He breakfasts with that Mr Trenchard and does all <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> things. Men who breakfast out are {{generally}} liberals. Have not you observed that? I wonder why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had that}} turf laid down myself. There were borders there when I first came, with hollyhocks, and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. The turf was an improvement." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{may have}} been repeating the words of some song," [...] said Mrs. Riversedge hopefully; [...] "there are lots of <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> silly refrains with girls' names," [...] she continued, turning to Clovis as a {{possible}} authority on the subject. [...] "'You mustn't call me Mary--'" ...|$|E
60|$|While we are {{discussing}} the true attitude of modern Socialism to property, it will be well to explain quite clearly the secular change of opinion {{that is going on}} in the Socialist ranks in regard to the process of expropriation. Even in the case of <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> property that Socialism repudiates, property in land, natural productions, inherited business capital and the like, Socialism has become humanized and rational from its first extreme and harsh positions.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you did," [...] Brooks {{answered}} him, [...] "you'd {{do it by}} yourself, and you'd stand a {{fair chance}} of being run out. There's {{going to be no}} preaching or hymn-singing here. <b>Those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> things are very well in their way, but they've {{nothing to do with this}} show. I'm not sure whether we shall open on Sundays or not. If we do it will be only for the ordinary business. Now let's get to work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mention it}} before, because I don't talk much <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. I don't pretend to {{understand}} them, {{and it is}} better to leave them alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! ah! I forgot; {{there are}} cutlets and <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. My hand {{is not in}} yet for this work, aunt. Well, as I was saying about Cambridge--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, how in {{the world}} do you get <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> ideas into your head?" [...] Tell laughed. [...] "Dangerous scheme! As if I should plot {{dangerous}} schemes with your papa!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, you see, I took up {{natural history}} {{and a whole lot}} of other {{subjects}} at the same time, and one can’t remember everything, can one? I used to know the difference between the Sardinian dormouse and the ordinary kind, and whether the wry-neck arrives at our shores earlier than the cuckoo, or the other way round, and how long the walrus takes in growing to maturity; I daresay you knew all <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> things once, but I bet you’ve forgotten them.” ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, I {{have been told}} that {{sometimes}} <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> ladies have been caught in their own snare; that is to say, have been so engaged by the good usage of the shopkeeper, and so unexpectedly surprised with some fine thing or other that has been shown them, that they have been drawn in by their fancy against their design, to lay out money, whether they had it or no; that is to say, to buy, and send home for money to pay for it.|$|E
60|$|This extravagance, {{wherever}} it began, had its first rise among <b>those</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> tradesmen, who, scorning {{the society of}} their shops and customers, applied themselves to rambling to courts and plays; kept company above themselves, and spent their hours in such company as lives always above them; this could not but bring great expense along with it, and that expense would not be confined to the bare keeping such company abroad, but soon showed itself in a living like them at home, whether the tradesmen could support it or no.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's found {{a better}} job," [...] he admitted. [...] "Kind of queer in his health, though. I've been taken {{a little like}} it myself, but <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things pass off--they pass off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a moment; {{that is very}} likely. I {{sent you}} word {{that you would have}} to pay for taking it up. Of course they don't abandon <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things without some consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Pamela went on, {{her eyes}} {{travelling}} out seaward for a moment, [...] "you {{seem to be}} one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> men, Mr. Fischer, who never do anything without an object." ...|$|R
