Measures included a sharp increase in prices the public-sector enterprises would charge the public, decreases in budgetary expenditures, a commitment to raise taxes, and a pledge to accelerate privatization of state economic enterprises (SEEs). Some observers questioned the credibility of these measures, given that the tax measures translated into a revenue increase equivalent to 4 percent of GDP and the expenditure cuts were equivalent to 6 percent of GDP.|$|E
25|$|Hypercycle theory {{proposed}} that hypercycles {{are not the}} final state of organization, and further development of more complicated systems is possible by enveloping the hypercycle {{in some kind of}} membrane. After evolution of compartments, a genome integration of the hypercycle can proceed by linking its members into a single chain, which forms a precursor of a genome. After that, the whole individualized and compartmentalized hypercycle can behave like a simple self-replicating entity. Compartmentalization provides some advantages for a system that has already established a linkage between units. Without compartments, genome integration would boost competition by limiting space and resources. Moreover, adaptive evolution requires <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>of</b> transmissible information for advantageous mutations in order not to aid less-efficient copies of the gene. The first advantage is that it maintains a high local concentration of molecules, which helps to locally increase the rate of synthesis. Secondly, it keeps the effect of mutations local, {{while at the same time}} affecting the whole compartment. This favours preservation of beneficial mutations, because it prevents them from spreading away. At the same time, harmful mutations cannot pollute the entire system if they are enclosed by the membrane. Instead, only the contaminated compartment is destroyed, without affecting other compartments. In that way, compartmentalization allows for selection for genotypic mutations. Thirdly, membranes protect against environmental factors because they constitute a barrier for high-weight molecules or UV irradiation. Finally, the membrane surface can work as a catalyst.|$|E

The USAF provided some of the C-17 delivery [...] "slots" [...] it had purchased to the RAAF to enable the type to rapidly enter Australian service, making them identical to American C-17 even in paint scheme, the only difference being the national markings.

2500|$|According to Robert Reischauer, {{president}} of the Urban Institute and {{vice chairman of the}} Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, [...] "Accessible information on the quality, price, effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare services and providers is developing rapidly, but is nowhere near the minimum standard assumed by well functioning CDHC. And employers, bound in part by Treasury Department regulations, do not vary deductibles, catastrophic caps or contributions to HSAs and HRAs to workers' family incomes or health status as equitable CDHC would call for....Many things we buy in health care are pieces of larger packages which are undefined when the decisions are made concerning whether to purchase and where to purchase. For example, when one goes to the doctor because of a particular set of symptoms, the doctor ask a number of questions which leads to a series of recommended tests whose results then determine an appropriate treatment regime. One could select the doctor to visit on the basis of price and quality but that is no guarantee that <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>of</b> tests and treatments that resulted would be the lowest cost or highest quality....The costs of the really expensive treatments would be largely unaffected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Oppenheimer of the Institute of Cognitive & Evolutionary Anthropology at Oxford University said, [...] "An {{interesting}} hypothesis {{put forward}} by paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould many years ago was that <b>the</b> <b>package</b> <b>of</b> the Mongoloid anatomical changes {{could be explained by}} the phenomenon of neoteny, whereby an infantile or childlike body form is preserved in adult life. Neoteny in hominids {{is still one of the}} simplest explanations of how we developed a disproportionately large brain so rapidly over the past few million years. The relatively large brain and the forward rotation of the skull on the spinal column, and body hair loss, both characteristic of humans, are found in foetal chimps. Gould suggested a mild intensification of neoteny in Mongoloids, in whom it has been given the name pedomorphy. Such a mechanism is likely to involve only a few controller genes and could therefore happen over a relatively short evolutionary period. It would also explain how the counterintuitive retrousse [...] nose and relative loss of facial hair got into the package".
