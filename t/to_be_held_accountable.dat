The situation reached a climax in the aftermath of Treasurer Peter Costello's 2006 Budget, whereby {{for the first time in}} recent Australian political history, the opposition leader and his colleagues ceased inquiry on the budget papers after just six questions, before resuming further questioning on the AWB scandal.

While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of The New York Times, who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between what she said and what was reported. The piece was criticised for its yellow journalism by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media. Benjamin Boles wrote in Now that, while Hirschberg's piece came across as a [...] "vicious ... character assassination", M.I.A's subsequent actions were [...] "childish" [...] and made her [...] "the laughing stock of the internet". The paper later printed a correction on the story, acknowledging that some quotes had been taken out of context. The incident prompted Boots Riley of the band Street Sweeper Social Club to comment on how artists had access to media that allowed writers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> and that M.I.A.'s move was [...] "brilliant".|$|E

2500|$|At an FCW house show on October 21, Ambrose {{challenged}} WWE wrestler CM Punk, who {{was making}} a guest appearance, to a match in which Ambrose was defeated in a 30-minute match, but was later paid tribute to by Punk. Ambrose's behind-the-back attack on WWE wrestler and FCW commentator William Regal set up a match between the two on the November 6 episode of FCW, where Regal pinned Ambrose to win the match. Following the loss to Regal, Ambrose became obsessed about wanting a rematch and regularly taunted Regal by using Regal's finishing moves to win matches. Ambrose started appearing at WWE house shows in December 2011. At WrestleMania XXVIII Axxess in April 2012, Ambrose had a confrontation with veteran hardcore wrestler Mick Foley, claiming that Foley needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for leading a generation astray.

Ambrose challenged old nemesis Seth Rollins for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship on the June 24 episode of FCW, but Rollins defeated him. Ambrose finally received a rematch with Regal on the final episode of FCW on July 15, which ended in a no contest when Ambrose kneed Regal's head into an exposed turnbuckle, causing Regal to bleed from the ear, but after the match nonetheless applauded Ambrose and allowed him to deliver a running knee lift, which prompted the FCW locker room {{to get in the}} ring to separate Ambrose from a fallen Regal while commentators questioned whether Regal would ever be able to wrestle again.|$|E

While he allows the human agent’s freedom to make personal decision to choose life/light from death/darkness, idolatry is an undisputable historical {{pattern in the}} entire course of human development since the fall.

In reference with the Anabaptist and Anglican notions of radical discipleship (Stott 2010; Wong 2014 b; Yoder 2012), whole-heartedly Open Science watchman-ship is a plausible ethical anchorage—which would necessitate this futuristic Open Science knowledge-space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eventually <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> by the heavenly or otherworldly realm in and beyond the Abrahamic religious traditions, which do not necessarily exclude other cultural-religious traditions.|$|R
