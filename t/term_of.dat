On account of the unavailability of some of the relevant data, this study cannot cover all the concepts <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. Hence, this study will concentrate only on the analysis which can be measured. The concepts <b>of</b> the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade in this study are the net barter <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade, the gross barter <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade and the income <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade. This study will investigate the trend of Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade in the period between 1975 and 1981, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of Thailand and Japan, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of Thailand and the United States, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of Thailand and ASEAN, and <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade of Thailand and EEC. The net barter <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade can be measured by dividing the price index of exports by the price index of imports. The gross barter <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> trade can be measured by dividing the quantity index of imports by the quantity index of exports.
