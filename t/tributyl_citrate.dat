40|$|Poly (lactic acid), PLA, is a {{biodegradable}} thermoplastic {{that can}} be produced from renewable resources. The polymer is of interest for production of films for packaging applications. However, plasticization of PLA is {{required in order to}} obtain films with sufficient flexibility. PLA was blended with <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (TbC) and two oligomers of TbC that were synthesized by transesterification of <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (TbC) and diethylene glycol (DEG). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the dynamic mechanical and thermal properties of the blends. All the plasticizers investigated decreased the glass transition temperature of PLA, and the reduction was the largest with the plasticizer having the lowest molecular weight. The PLA matrix became saturated with plasticizer at a certain concentration and phase separation occurred; the higher the molecular weight of the plasticizer, the lower the saturation concentration. Aging of the blends at room temperature for several months induced partial phase separation in the material. It was observed that the morphological stability of the blends was enhanced when the plasticizer concentration was reasonably low, i. e. 10 – 15 wt%...|$|E

40|$|Pervaporation is a membrane-separation {{technique}} {{which uses}} polymeric and/or ceramic membranes. In {{the case of}} pervaporation processes applied to dehydration, the membrane should transport water molecules preferentially. Reactive ionic liquid (RIL) (3 -(1, 3 -diethoxy- 1, 3 -dioxopropan- 2 -yl) - 1 -methyl- 1 H-imidazol- 3 -ium) was used to prepare novel dense cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) based membranes, applying the phase-inversion method. The designed polymer-ionic liquid system contained ionic liquid partially linked to the polymeric structure via the transesterification reaction. The various physicochemical, mechanical, equilibrium and transport properties of CAP-RIL membranes were determined and compared with the properties of CAP membranes modified with plasticizers, i. e., <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (TBC) and acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) testified that CAP-RIL membranes as well as CAP membranes modified with TBC and ATBC are thermally stable up to at least 120 °C. Tensile tests of the membranes revealed improved mechanical properties reflected by reduced brittleness and increased elongation at break achieved for CAP-RIL membranes in contrast to pristine CAP membranes. RIL plasticizes the CAP matrix, and CAP-RIL membranes possess preferable mechanical properties in comparison to membranes with other plasticizers investigated. The incorporation of RIL into CAP membranes tuned the surface properties of the membranes, enhancing their hydrophilic character. Moreover, the addition of RIL into CAP resulted in an excellent improvement of the separation factor, in comparison to pristine CAP membranes, in pervaporation dehydration of propan- 2 -ol. The separation factor β increased from ca. 10 for pristine CAP membrane to ca. 380 for CAP- 16. 7 -RIL membranes contacting an azeotropic composition of water-propan- 2 -ol mixture (i. e., 12 wt % water) ...|$|E

The glass transition temperature of PLA decreased linearly as the plasticizer content was increased. Both plasticizers were miscible with PLA to an extent of similar to 25 wt %. At this point, the PLA seemed to be saturated with plasticizer and the blends tended to phase separate when more plasticizer was added. There were also signs of phase separation occurring in samples heated at 35, 50, and 80 degreesC, most likely because of the material undergoing crystallization.

Migration testing was carried out at 40 oC for 10 days (EEC 1993). Determination of the analyte was performed by applying an analytical methodology based on surfactant (Triton X− 114) mediated extraction prior to gas chromatographic-flame ionization detection. PVC cling film used was subjected to ionizing treatment with a [60 Co] source, as well as to electron-beam irradiation at doses equal to 5, 15 and 25 kGy, with an aim to compare the effect of type and dose of radiation on PVC specific migration behaviour. Equilibrium concentrations of acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> into the aqueous solvents covered the ranges 173 − 422 μg L- 1 and 296 − 513 μg L- 1 for gamma and electron-irradiated PVC, respectively. Hence, e-beam irradiation resulted in significantly higher ATBC migration amounts compared to gamma treatment. The highest extraction efficiency of the 10 % ethanol solution was common in both gamma and e-beam treatments; distilled water demonstrated the lowest migration. Gamma irradiation at intermediate doses up to 5 kGy produced no statistically significant (p> 0. 05) effect on ATBC migration into all three aqueous simulants; however, this does not apply for high-energy electrons. Both ionizing treatments were similar in that they resulted in statistically significant (p< 0. 05) differences in plasticizer migrating amounts between non-irradiated and irradiated at doses of 15 and 25 kGy samples. Gamma radiation did not affect the kinetics of plasticizer migration. On the contrary, electron-beam radiation produced shorter equilibration times for all food-simulating solvents tested at 40 oC [...] Above values regarding ATBC migration into aqueous food simulants are far below the EU proposed upper limit of specific migration (5 mg kg- 1 ¬) for both types of ionizing radiation. Thus, PVC cling film may be used in food irradiation applications in contact with aqueous foodstuffs...|$|E

Used plasticizers are acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC) and triacetin (TA), two molecules with established miscibility and plasticizing efficiency. Lower plasticizer permanence of TA compared with ATBC is found. The plasticizer molecules decreased the size of the cooperativity domains at the glass transition temperature Tg and likely in the glassy state by decreasing intermacromolecular interactions and notwithstanding the mesolactide content of PLA and the chemical identity of the plasticizer. The recovery function is given and shows a significant effect of the plasticizer on the physical ageing. The supplementary free volume brought by the plasticizer enhances molecular mobility in the glassy state and increases structural relaxation at one order of magnitude.

PID 37 proved to be miscible with PLA because of its polar functions and short alkyl groups. It decreased the PLA glass-transition temperature (Tg) and increased in ductility when Tg approached room temperature. Squalene had a low miscibility because of the absence of polar groups. Tg was not depressed. Ductility improvements were nevertheless reached because the immiscible inclusions efficiently induced crazing by the distribution of stress concentration points all over the material; this delayed failure. The maximum elongations at break were 60 % for squalene, 400 % for DOA, and 500 % for PID 37. The solubility factors were, thus, an efficient prediction tool for the plasticizing behavio...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{the barrier}} {{properties}} to gas and organic compounds of biosourced polyesters, such as polylactides (PLAs), by increasing their crystallinity {{has been suggested}} by several authors. This paper investigates the risk of microphase separation for a technological approach that would involve a plasticization of PLA, to further its crystallization kinetics, with common plasticizers: Acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC) and Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Overplasticization effects following microphase separation were monitored along the film thickness by exposing dynamically thermo-compressed films to nitroxide spin-probes. The method enabled a scan of the local polymer mobility for different concentration profiles in spin-probes, with in particular a maximum moving continuously in time towards the geometric center. The results were interpreted as excess local temperatures that would give similar ESR spectra motion in the bulk. It was shown that measured excess temperatures {{could be related to}} local shifts in the glass transition temperature along the film thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

PLA/PBAT, PLA/ATBC, and PLA/PBAT/ATBC mixtures with 10 – 35 wt % ATBC and/or PBAT were prepared in a discontinuous laboratory mixer, compression-molded, and characterized by thermal, morphological, and mechanical tests to evaluate the effect of the concentration of either the plasticizer or copolyester on the final material flexibility. Materials with modulable properties, Young’s modulus in the range 100 – 3000 MPa and elongation at break in the range 10 – 300 %, were obtained. Moreover, thermal analysis showed a preferential solubilization of ATBC in the PBAT phase. Gas permeability tests were also performed to assess possible use in food packaging applications.

Contrary to expectation, the oxygen diffusion coefficient in neat and formulated PLA did not decrease with crystallization. Even an increase of the diffusion coefficient was noticed for the most interacting probe, EA, in formulated PLA. Conditioning of neat and formulated PLA in an atmosphere containing EA vapour caused a modification of the material structure by plasticization and induced crystallization even at small EA activities. The plasticizing effect caused the glass transition temperature T(g) to shift to below ambient temperature. In the case of neat PLA induced crystallization in solely the alpha form was obtained, and in the case of formulated PLA a blend of alpha and alpha' forms was observed.

DINCH has limited compatibility with PLA, leading to PLA/DINCH blends with phase separation in which DINCH forms spherical dispersed phase. TBC is compatible with PLA and evenly distributed in PLA. Plasticized PLA with 10 and 20 phr DINCH have a constant glass transition temperature (Tg) of 50 °C and are stiff materials with high elongation at break and impact strength. TBC could significantly decrease the Tg and increase the crystallinity of PLA, and PLA/TBC (100 / 20) blend is a soft material with a Tg of 24 °C. The durability of plasticized PLA was characterized by weight loss measurement under water immersion, mechanical properties, and thermal analysis.

The films were analyzed by means of gas chromatography (GC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), contact angle measurements, and tensile testing. Storage of the plasticized films resulted in an increased crystallinity and changes in the film properties, rendering CH welding difficult. The welding process had no influence on thermal properties, such as cold crystallization temperature, melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and degree of crystallinity, of neat PLA but caused significant changes in the crystallinity of the plasticized materials. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

Therefore, methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) {{was used as}} an interfacial compatibilizer to improve the mechanical properties of PLA/tapioca blends. The addition of MDI could improve the tensile strength of the blend with 60 wt% tapioca, from 19. 8 to 42. 6 MPa. In addition, because PLA lacked toughness, acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC) was added as a plasticizer to improve the ductility of PLA. A significant decrease in the melting point and glass-transition temperature was observed on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry, which indicated that the PLA structure was not dense after ATBC was added. As such, the brittleness was improved, and the elongation at break was extended to several hundred percent. Therefore, mixing ATBC with PLA/tapioca/MDI blends did exhibit the effect of plasticization and biodegradation.

The water solubility of the films ranged from 21 % to 59. 5 %.

Intending to understand the changes in the thermal properties, the nano-biocomposites were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The presence of the OMMT clay did not influence significantly the transition temperatures. However, the filler not only acted as a nucleating agent which enhanced the crystallization, but also as a thermal barrier, improving the thermal stability of the biopolymer.

The characteristic brittleness of PLLA is attributed to slow crystallization rates, which results {{in the formation of}} the large spherulites. Its glass temperature is relative high, above room temperature and close to 60 ºC, and therefore its applications are limited.

Comparative interpretation of creep behaviour between composites with different additives was presented and {{the factors that}} influenced creep were identified. In comparison with unmodified composites, the additive {{that proved to be}} the most effective in reducing creep was thiodiphenol, which formed hydrogen bonds at the interface of polymer and fibre; while a decrease was observed with <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> a plasticiser. The suppression of creep in the composites with thiodiphenol was due to reduction in the viscous flow contribution to total creep and a significant increase in both the elastic and viscoelastic deformation. The reduction in creep for the plasticised composites was mainly attributed to a reduction in the viscous flow contribution and an increase in the viscoelastic deformation. The elastic component did not show any changes from the unmodified composite. With hyperbranched polyester, a toughness modifier, an increase in permanent strain and reduction in the recoverable strain were attributed to the hyperbranched molecules being able to easily flow past each other as they cannot form chain entanglements due to their globular structure...|$|E

FFS formulations were distinguished based on their ability to sustain the release of betamethasone 17 -valerate (BMV) in vitro over 72 h. The effect of film-forming polymer (hydrophilic: hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel™ LF); hydrophobic: polymethacrylate copolymers (Eudragit® NE and Eudragit® RS), and polyacrylate copolymer (Dermacryl® 79) was first determined, and then the impact of incorporation of plasticisers (triethyl citrate, <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> and dibutyl sebacate) was examined. The Klucel film released a significantly higher amount of BMV than the hydrophobic FFS, 42 versus 4 μg/cm 2, respectively. The release was increased when a plasticiser was incorporated, and with higher enhancement ratios achieved with the more lipophilic plasticisers. In conclusion, the results show that FFSs can sustain drug release (hence representing useful systems for prolonged dermal therapy) and emphasise the importance of the formulation on drug delivery, with the type of polymer being of greatest significance...|$|E
40|$|Poly(lactic acid), PLA, was {{blended with}} monomeric and {{oligomeric}} plasticizers {{in order to}} enhance its flexibility and thereby overcome its inherent problem of brittleness. Differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and tensile testing were used to investigate the properties of the blends. Monomeric plasticizers, such as <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate,</b> TbC, and diethyl bishydroxymethyl malonate, DBM, drastically decreased the T-g of PLA, but the blends showed no morphological stability over time since rapid cold crystallization caused a size reduction of the amorphous domains in PLA. Consequently, the ability of PLA to accommodate the plasticizer diminished with the increase in crystallinity and migration of the plasticizer occurred. Increasing the molecular weight of the plasticizers by synthesizing oligoesters and oligoesteram ides resulted in blends that displayed T-g depressions slightly smaller than with the monomeric plasticizers. The compatibility with PLA was dependent on the molecular weight of the oligomers and on the presence or not of polar amide groups that were able to positively interact with the PLA chains. Aging the materials at ambient temperature revealed that the enhanced flexibility as well as the morphological stability of the films plasticized with the oligomers could be maintained {{as a result of the}} higher molecular weight and the polar interactions with PLA...|$|E
40|$|Poly(lactide), a {{bio-based}} aliphatic polyester, is {{a subject}} to large research effort. One point of optimization is the acceleration of its crystallization kinetics to promote crystallinity under nonisothermal polymer processing conditions by means of compounding with nucleating agents and plasticizers. The nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of neat and formulated poly(L,D-lactide) (PDLLA) from the melt with talc and polyethylene glycol (PEG) or acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (ATBC) were studied {{with the help of}} the AvramiJeziorny and LiuMo analysis. Talc showed to be a moderately efficient nucleating agent, as it causes only small increase of crystallization kinetics and shows no effect on the crystallization activation energy. A synergistic effect with plasticizers was observed, expanding the crystallization window significantly. PEG was found to be a more efficient plasticizer than ATBC but causes large decrease in the molecular weight average of PDLLA upon thermal treatment. The talc/ATBC system is efficient starting with an ATBC concentration of 9 wt%. The acceleration observed was a crystallization half-time decrease of 30 % compared to neat PLA and reaching maximum crystallization enthalpies even at cooling rate of 25 degrees C min 1. The ATBC/talc system can be recommended as an efficient system for acceleration of nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of PDLLA. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2013.

40|$|The {{success of}} adhesive-retained extraoral facial {{prostheses}} depends on retention of the artificial {{part to the}} skin that is often scarred secondary to surgery and/or radiation treatment. Facial prostheses are re-tained by adhesives, mechanical means, and/or craniofacial implants. 1 - 4 Attaching prostheses to the skin with an adhesive is an effective and commonly used method. The interaction of adhesive materials with skin presents problems, such as the longevity of the bond, dermatologic (sensitivity) problems, {{and the ability to}} completely remove adhesive residue. Mainte-nance of the skin and prosthesis requires considerable daily effort and dexterity by the patient. Skin-Prep protective dressing (Smith & Nephew, Inc, Largo, Fla.) (isopropyl alcohol, butyl ester of polyvinyl methacrylate/methyl methacrylate copoly-mer, acetyl <b>tributyl</b> <b>citrate)</b> is used where “skin needs protection from adhesive, trauma, abrasion, chafing, irritation, and exposure to fecal and urinary effluent” (according to Smith & Nephew product literature). It “creates a physical, waterproof barrier that is nonirri-tating…and allows the skin to breathe. ” Wilborn 5 studied skin punch biopsies by SEM to determine the effect of adhesive tape removal on skin protected by Skin-Prep protective dressing.
