40|$|Aims Chronic {{benzodiazepine}} use {{is highly}} prevalent and {{is associated with}} a variety of negative health consequences. The present study examined the long-term effectiveness of a <b>tailored</b> patient education intervention on benzodiazepine use. Participants A randomized controlled trial was conducted comprising three arms, comparing (i) a single <b>tailored</b> intervention; (ii) a multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention and (iii) a general practitioner letter. The post-test took place after 12 months. Participants Five hundred and eight patients using benzodiazepines were recruited by their general practitioners and assigned randomly to one of the three groups. Intervention Two <b>tailored</b> interventions, the single <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received one <b>tailored</b> letter) and the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received three sequential <b>tailored</b> letters at intervals of 1 month), were compared to a short general practitioner letter that modelled usual care. The <b>tailored</b> interventions not only provided different and more information than the general practitioner letter; they were also personalized and adapted to individual baseline characteristics. The information in both <b>tailored</b> interventions was the same, but in the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention the information was provided to the participants spread over three occasions. In the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention, the second and the third <b>tailored</b> letters were based on short and standardized telephone interviews. Measurements Benzodiazepine cessation at post-test was the outcome measure. Findings The results showed that participants receiving the <b>tailored</b> interventions were twice as likely to have quit benzodiazepine use compared to the general practitioner letter. Particularly among participants with the intention to discontinue usage at baseline, both <b>tailored</b> interventions led to high percentages of those who actually discontinued usage (single <b>tailored</b> intervention 51. 7 %; multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention 35. 6 %; general practitioner letter 14. 5 %). Conclusions It was concluded that <b>tailored</b> patient education can be an effective tool for reducing benzodiazepine use, and can be implemented easily...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the working {{mechanisms}} of a computer <b>tailored</b> physical activity intervention for older adults with environmental information compared to a basic <b>tailored</b> intervention without environmental information. Method A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer <b>tailored</b> interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two <b>tailored</b> interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three <b>tailored</b> letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic <b>tailored</b> intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing <b>tailored</b> environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), environmental perceptions and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were mediated by changes in environmental perceptions. Changes in environmental perceptions did not mediate the effect of the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention, the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30. 2). Additionally, the <b>tailored</b> letters of the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion This study gave some first indications of the relevance of environmental perceptions as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tailoring</b> {{the mode}} of {{delivery}} to improve recall and behavioral intention: a matter of preference? <b>Tailored</b> interventions using content <b>tailoring</b> {{have been shown to}} be effective in improving different health behaviours. Nonetheless, the overall effect sizes remain small suggesting room for improvement. This study examines whether <b>tailoring</b> to mode preference is more effective than non-tailoring in terms of recall and intention to perform breast self-examination (BSE). BSE instructions were either <b>tailored</b> to the participant’s mode preference (text, text with illustrations, or video) or non-tailored by randomly providing one of these modes. Results of an online experiment among 205 female participants showed that the intention to perform BSE was higher if the instruction was <b>tailored</b> to the mode preference. There were no effects of <b>tailoring</b> on recall of information. This study shows that we should move beyond content <b>tailoring</b> and should take into account {{the mode of}} delivery to meet individual’s needs and increase the effectiveness of <b>tailored</b> messages...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic premise}} behind <b>tailored</b> health {{communication}} is that {{information that is}} customized to an individual (rather than a group) will be viewed as more personally relevant, {{will be more likely}} to be read and cognitively processed, and ultimately will have a better chance of stimulating behavioral change. Abstract: <b>Tailored</b> health communica-tion research represents a very promis-ing line of inquiry that has the potential to produce major impacts on lifestyle behaviors. This study defines <b>tailoring</b> and discusses how <b>tailored</b> interven-tions operate, including comparing/ contrasting different <b>tailoring</b> chan-nels. Next, the authors review the lit-erature on <b>tailored</b> interventions to change lifestyle behaviors, with a focus on smoking cessation, dietary change, and physical activity, as well as inter-ventions that address multiple lifestyle behaviors. Finally, future directions for <b>tailoring</b> research are discussed. To date, a large literature has amassed showing the promise of <b>tailored</b> pro-grams delivered via print, Internet, local computer/kiosk, telephone, and interpersonal channels. Numerous studies demonstrate that these programs are capable of significant impacts on smoking cessation, dietary change, physical activity, and multiple behav-ior change. It is concluded that the potential of <b>tailoring</b> will be more fully realized as (a) the field builds a more cumulative science of <b>tailoring</b> and (b) greater dissemination of efficacious <b>tailored</b> programs takes place...|$|R

5|$|Though the {{reputation}} of tailoring on Savile Row is for made-to-measure suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves & Hawkes, a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy <b>tailor</b> founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and <b>tailor</b> to the British Army. Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of tailoring in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London, he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team, and for the 1968 film , and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977. Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No.14.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Message <b>tailoring,</b> {{based on}} {{individual}} needs and circumstances, {{is commonly used}} to enhance face-to-face patient counseling. Only recently has individual <b>tailoring</b> become feasible for printed messages. This study sought to determine whether printed <b>tailored</b> recommendations addressing women's specific screening and risk status and perceptions about breast cancer and mammography are more effective than standardized printed recommendations. METHODS. Computer-assisted telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} 435 women, aged 40 to 65 years, who had visited family practice groups within the previous 2 years. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive individually <b>tailored</b> or standardized mammography recommendation letters mailed from physicians to patients' homes. Follow-up interviews were conducted 8 months later. RESULTS. <b>Tailored</b> letter recipients were more likely to remember and to have read more of their letters than standardized version recipients. After controlling for baseline status, <b>tailored</b> letter receipt was associated with more favorable follow-up mammography status for women with incomes below $ 26, 000 and for Black women. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Tailored</b> messages are a more effective medium for physicians' mammography recommendations; <b>tailoring</b> may be especially important for women of low socioeconomic status...|$|R
