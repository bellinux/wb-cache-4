5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to <b>that</b> <b>type,</b> but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed <b>that</b> <b>type</b> IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Prolog is {{traditionally}} not statically typed. Since {{the benefits of}} static typing are huge, {{it was decided to}} grow a portable type system inside two widely used open source Prolog systems: SWI-Prolog and Yap. This requires close cooperation and agreement between the two systems. The type system is Hindley-Milner. The main characteristics of the introduction of types in SWI and Yap are <b>that</b> <b>typing</b> is not mandatory, <b>that</b> <b>typed</b> and untyped code can be mixed, and <b>that</b> the <b>type</b> checker can insert dynamic type checks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. The basic decisions and the current status of the Typed Prolog project are described, as well as the remaining tasks and problems to be solved. ...|$|R
5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view <b>that</b> <b>type</b> II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>Type</b> Ia supernovae that were considered the same are in fact different; moreover, a form of the Type Ia supernova that is relatively infrequent today was far more common earlier {{in the history of}} the universe.

5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists.

Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period}} of activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E

5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with <b>that</b> <b>type</b> of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in <b>that</b> <b>type</b> of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of <b>that</b> <b>type</b> with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|Each side can {{construct}} {{two types}} of magical buildings, each of which produces one type of spellcaster and researches more advanced spells for <b>that</b> <b>type.</b> These advanced buildings can be constructed only with assistance from other buildings. The Human Cleric and Orc Necrolyte can both defend themselves by magic and also see distant parts of the territory for short periods. The Cleric's other spells are protective, healing the injured and making troops invisible, while the Necrolyte raises skeletons as troops and can make other units temporarily invulnerable, {{at the cost of}} severely damaging them when the spell dissipates. The Human Conjurer and Orc Warlock have energy blasts, wider-range destruction spells and the ability to summon small, venomous monsters. The Conjurer can summon a water elemental, while the Warlock can summon a demonic melee unit.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Walter Baade {{became the}} first {{astronomer}} to identify a nebula as a supernova remnant when he suggested that the Crab Nebula was the remains of SN 1054. He noted that, while it had {{the appearance of a}} planetary nebula, the measured velocity of expansion was much too large to belong to that classification. During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator. Later, the work of Allan Sandage and Gustav Tammann helped refine the process so <b>that</b> <b>Type</b> Ia supernovae became a type of standard candle for measuring large distances across the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to <b>that</b> <b>type,</b> but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

We define critical types to be types whose rationalizable correspondence is sensitive to assumptions about arbitrarily high-order beliefs.

We use this characterization to show <b>that</b> all <b>types</b> in commonly used type spaces are critical.

5|$|The {{first two}} 1804 dollars (as {{well as the}} other coins for the sets) were struck in November 1834. Soon, Roberts' trip was {{expanded}} to Indo-China (then known as Annam) and Japan, so two additional sets were struck. The pieces struck {{under the auspices of the}} Mint are known as Class I 1804 dollars, and eight of <b>that</b> <b>type</b> are known to exist today. Roberts left for his trip in April 1835, and he presented one set each to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam. The gift to the Sultan of Muscat was part of an exchange of diplomatic gifts that resulted in the Sultan presenting the Washington Zoo with a full-grown lion and lioness. Roberts fell ill in Bangkok and was taken to Macao, where he died in June 1835. Following Roberts' death, the remaining two sets were returned to the Mint without being presented to the dignitaries.|$|E

The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of <b>that</b> <b>type</b> are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis).|$|E

5|$|With the {{mechanization}} {{of transport}} {{and the military}} in the 20th century, the Anglo-Norman was no longer in demand as a carriage and military horse. In addition, World War II and the German occupation of France caused significant damage to the Norman homeland of the breed as fighting destroyed farms and killed half of the horses at the National Stud at Saint-Lô. Most of the surviving were of the Norman Cob breed, and horses lost their status as animals of luxury and leisure. Many farms were left in ruins, and breeders were left rethinking their breeding aims. Certain provisions of the Marshall Plan convinced them not to focus on breeding draft horses, and <b>that</b> <b>type</b> began to disappear. Instead, emphasis shifted toward producing horses for equestrian sports, and a stud book was created for the Anglo-Norman breed on December 7, 1950, at Saint-Lô. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Anglo-Norman became a major force in international equine competition. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, the Anglo-Norman Lutteur B won a gold medal in show jumping.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end <b>that</b> <b>type</b> of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
