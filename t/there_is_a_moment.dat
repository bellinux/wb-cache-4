500|$|Part of {{the story}} {{involves}} the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns [...] "Dr. Fell"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate {{the death of a}} gypsy pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as [...] "very thoughtful". Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption. Starling does not, however, and perseveres to the end, even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself.|$|E
500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} big push. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who would have noticed another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt {{pressure}} {{in making the}} episode be a worthy sequel to [...] "Blink", which he called a [...] "brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode", but also {{said that it was}} great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like [...] "mum and dad arguing over directions in the car". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was [...] "great fun" [...] on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.|$|E

500|$|Underwood's {{sexuality}} is ambiguous {{throughout much of}} the first two seasons; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women, but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label. Before Season 2, various sources speculated about his homosexuality. It is revealed in [...] "Chapter 8" [...] he had an experience with homosexuality in college. Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1. Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted: if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real-life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair, he would be accused of being [...] "secretly gay, turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play". Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood's sexuality, but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire. In season 2, Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum (Nathan Darrow), while in season 3, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer, Tom Yates (Paul Sparks). The same season, however, also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other. In season five, he has sex with Eric Rawlings (Malcolm Madera), his male personal trainer.|$|E
500|$|Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) {{is being}} {{released}} from a military prison for unknown reasons. Upon leaving, he runs into Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) and Desmond {{while he was in}} prison, and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship. Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Charles Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island. He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit, Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) (who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks) who takes him to the [...] The two live together for three years before Desmond finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond's boat. Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down, Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the hatch door, and turns on a light. Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself.|$|E
2500|$|Ranaâ€™s work {{deals with}} {{everyday}} {{issues ranging from}} faith and tradition to urbanization and popular culture. He uses photography and video installations to depict his commentary and parody of both social and political scenarios. In his composite photomontages, for instance, each main image {{is made up of}} several thousand smaller photographs of diametrically opposite subjects. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of sudden withdrawal when the viewer moves closer to the picture and becomes aware of the tiny [...] images that compose the larger one.|$|E

2500|$|Hayden {{announced}} his retirement on May 6, 1968, saying [...] "Among other things that fifty-six years in Congress have taught me is that contemporary events need contemporary men. Time actually makes specialists of us all. When a house is built <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> for the foundation, another for the walls, the roof and so on. Arizona's foundation includes fast highways, adequate electric power, and abundant water, and these foundations have been laid. It is {{time for a new}} building crew to report, so I have decided to retire from office at the close of my term this year." [...] Hayden recommended long-term aide Roy Elson to succeed him.

60|$|But the {{consolation}} {{coming from}} devotion {{did not go}} far with such a one as her. We cannot rest on religion merely by saying that we will do so. Very speedily there comes consolation in another form. Queen Anne is on her deathbed, and a young Stuart prince appears upon the scene, of whom some loyal hearts dream {{that they can make}} a king. He is such as Stuarts were, and only walks across the novelist's canvas to show his folly and heartlessness. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in which Beatrix thinks that she may rise in the world to the proud place of a royal mistress. That is her last ambition! That is her pride! That is to be her glory! The bleared eyes can see no clearer than that. But the mock prince passes away, and nothing but the disgrace of the wish remains.|$|E
