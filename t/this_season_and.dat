5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|York {{started the}} season by playing away to Tranmere Rovers, who were new to League Two after being relegated from League One after 2013–14. Keith Lowe gave York the lead with a header from Meikle's {{corner in the}} 67th minute, before Tranmere {{equalised}} through James Rowe in stoppage time as the match ended a 1–1 draw. This {{was followed by a}} 1–0 home defeat to Doncaster Rovers {{in the first round of}} the League Cup, after Harry Forrester scored for the League One team in stoppage time. Hyde scored from a Straker corner on his debut to give York the lead over Northampton Town in a home match, before the visitors made the score 1–1 in the 90th minute from a Marc Richards free kick. Cambridge United took a two-goal lead at York, before Hyde scored a header shortly before half time and Wes Fletcher scored a penalty in the 83rd minute, seeing the match end a 2–2 draw. York then played away to Exeter City, who were also without a win <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> drew 1–1; Exeter took the lead in the eighth minute before Lowe equalised with a header from a Summerfield corner in the 82nd minute.

5|$|After ranking 17th of 48 {{clubs in}} the Football League North in 1942–43, York progressed through the War Cup {{qualifying}} stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time.

In the 1943–44 Football League North, the team finished 31st of 50 clubs, and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7–2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. York experienced selection problems in 1944–45 with many players leaving for war service; after ranking 42nd of 54 {{clubs in the}} Football League North, they then failed {{to qualify for the}} War Cup knock-out stages. They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945–46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. York finished midtable in the Third Division North (East) {{in the first half of}} the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. The FA Cup resumed <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> <b>and</b> for the first and only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11–1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. York made a profit in five of the seven seasons played during the war.|$|E

They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In <b>this</b> <b>season</b> <b>and</b> up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E
