5000|$|Dinner is approaching, {{and by now}} {{everyone}} in the family knows about Warren's telephone call except for Mr. Smith. When he joins the family at the dinner table, everyone gulps down their food so they can leave before Warren calls. Unfortunately, they are not fast enough, and the telephone rings. Mr. Smith answers, but is confused when the operators tell him that someone is calling from New York. He hangs up, and Esther accidentally tells him everything out of anger. He soon figures out that {{he was the only one}} who didn't know about the call, and tries to put his foot down, but when <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> <b>again</b> he tells Rose to answer it. Her phone call turns out to be less than successful, because he was only calling to ask how she was, and he said if his parents knew he was calling, they would kill him.

As soon as she walks in, she sits down at a man's table, asking if he is waiting for someone. When he says no, she asks him to dance with her. Claire and Elton dance for a few hours and we next see her waking up in his bed the next morning. It is apparent that she picked up someone to take her home with them, for a safe place to spend the night. When she arrives home, she feels something is out of place. He watches her speak to someone (Roland), then follows her to a hotel where she stays for quite some time, then gives up waiting.|$|R

Cheech asks Chong to pick up his cousin and hang out with him as Cheech informs him they have similar interests like [...] "go to clubs," [...] "get plenty of chicks," [...] and [...] "likes to get high." [...] Chong heads off to the hotel where Red is staying and arrives to find him in a dispute with the receptionist (played by Paul Reubens) over how much the room is costing ("$37.50 a week, not a goddamned day!").

They break into the room around the back and Red retrieves his luggage and the receptionist is falsely arrested after calling the cops to arrest Chong and Red but accidentally assaults them and is taken away to jail.|$|R

5000|$|Burt {{is unable}} to leave his estranged wife Vera alone. The day after Christmas, Burt comes back to Vera's house to explain away his poor, erratic {{behavior}} from the day before. Christmas Day, Burt put too many logs in the fire which could've burned the place down. On his way out {{to make room for}} Vera's boyfriend Charlie, who is to arrive after six, Burt steals a couple pies from the kitchen counter. On the 26th Vera does not want to talk to Burt; she doesn't have the time, she has plans. Burt apologizes but Vera does not think it's very sincere. Burt notices cigarette butts that are not Vera's regular brand collected in the ashtray, [...] "their ashtray," [...] and feels out of place. While Vera is <b>the</b> bathroom <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> and she shouts at Burt to answer it. It's a call for Charlie and Burt responds curtly, saying he's [...] "not here" [...] before leaving <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> off <b>the</b> hook. Vera comes back into the kitchen, and it's clear she cannot tolerate Burt sticking around. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> <b>again</b> (it's for Charlie again) and Vera says she'll answer it from the bedroom. Instead of hanging up when Vera commands, Burt takes a knife from the cabinet and cuts the cord in two. Vera realizes what's happened and grabs a knife herself and yells for Burt to leave, saying she'll get a restraining order. Burt leaves calmly and, as he drives away in his car holding the ashtray, he is deludedly positive that in a few weeks they'll have a [...] "serious talk" [...] and get back together.

50|$|The play {{opens with}} the ominous ringing of an off-stage {{telephone}}. As the lights come up Ruth and Jack, {{a couple in}} their mid-thirties, are dancing in their apartment. The telephone <b>rings</b> <b>again,</b> the couple stops, the music backs up a few measures and they begin to dance. Ruth and Jack dance on and converse about what a good time they are having; after a few lines the telephone rings, the music backs up a few measures and the conversation also goes back a few lines and this time changes direction. A few lines go by and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> <b>again,</b> and <b>the</b> conversation once more rewinds and restarts, yet again changing focus. This pattern of rewinding and restarting the conversation in a different vein continues throughout the play whenever the unseen telephone rings. This convention {{is similar to the}} bell ringing in Ives’s previous work Sure Thing (one of six plays in the collection All in the Timing). As the play progresses the audience learns that the couple is in a tenuous state in their relationship and the happiness seen as the play opens is not the prevalent mood. Ruth is Jewish; Jack is a former Catholic. Ruth believes in hard work and success; Jack is lazy and has no goals. Ruth desperately wants to be married; Jack hates the idea of marriage. With each <b>ring</b> of <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>the</b> love affair dissolves into a more intense argument about religion, the future or marriage; however, this does not prevent a build-up of hope with each ring that perhaps the couple may work out their differences and come to an agreement. At one point Ruth and Jack even switch positions: Jack argues for marriage, Ruth argues against it, and it is this final argument that leads to the dissolution of their relationship. After a slew of “fuck you’s” from Jack and “leave’s” from Ruth, the two realize they can no longer be together, but they also {{do not know how to}} function without one another. The play ends with a final <b>phone</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>the</b> couple beginning to dance as they did in the start of the play.|$|R

Phuchit is ready to hang up, thinking the call is cruel joke being played on him by his co-workers or friends. But then the caller tells Phuchit his full name, age, employment status and other details that makes Phuchit stay on the line. To win the 10,000 baht, {{all he has to do}} is swat a fly which is at that very moment buzzing around him and has been pestering him the whole time he's been sitting in the stairwell. The caller even says there is a rolled up newspaper nearby. Phutchit grabs the paper and swats the fly.|$|R

The angel's neck is damaged and the heavy stone head falls onto Aaron's face, killing him instantly and mutilating his face. Cheri runs away from the scene, not realizing that she has dropped the set of keys that Frank found in the earlier scene. Cheri borrows her father's car and goes to the convenience store to get Duffy's bowling ball, intending to replace the angel head with the bowling ball and implicate Duffy as killing Aaron. As she drives away from the store, she sees the shooting and reports a description of Duffy to the police. When Cheri arrives back at the cemetery, she drops the bowling ball when she sees that Aaron's body is gone. She tries to leave, but her car is again having trouble starting.

Cheri hangs up quickly, and while she is crossing the street, <b>the</b> cell <b>phone</b> <b>rings</b> <b>again,</b> and, distracted, she stops {{in the middle of the}} road, where she is hit by the van containing Mark, Tim, and Eddie.

Weston also sees the paper and realizes the victim wasn't Rebecca and calls the ladies' number, but they had already left the house to investigate and go to visit the hostess {{who is in the}} midst of bottle-feeding her baby and recognizes Brenda's photo in the paper. They then proceed to the address given by Weston to confirm if he is the same man they saw in the lounge. The door to his room is open and they go inside, commenting on his poor housekeeping. A man comes in, introducing himself as Tubbs (John Mitchum), the building manager. The ladies tell him they were paying a surprise visit to their nephew and leave. Weston calls the ladies again, but hangs up just before they walk in and pick up <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Hallum and Lutz arrive at Weston's apartment and learn from Tubbs that the ladies had already been there.
