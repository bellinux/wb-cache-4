5|$|The {{following}} chapters {{describe in}} detail the places Wallace visited. Wallace includes numerous observations on the people, their languages, ways of living, and social organisation, {{as well as on}} the plants and animals found in each location. He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E

Camazotz is similar to Earth, with familiar trees such as birches, pines, and maples, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which [...] "might {{have been one of}} any number of familiar towns". The horror of the place arises from its ordinary appearance, endlessly duplicated.

2500|$|... 2007: The World Bank's Inspection Panel {{investigated}} {{the practices of}} the World Bank in the rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo following a request from indigenous groups working in partnership with RFN and the Rainforest Foundation UK. The Panel highlighted a series of failures {{on the part of}} the Bank to comply with its own internal environmental and social policies and safeguards, to recognize the importance of the forests for the subsistence and sustainable development of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> and depend on them, and to promote truly sustainable approaches to forest management. The Panel concluded that the World Bank's bias in favor of industrial logging impoverished local people, and that the Bank should rethink its approach to forest management and develop a policy based on true participation of forest-based peoples, with the aim of securing their traditional rights and promoting alternatives to industrial logging. The Inspection Panel's investigation of the allegedly unsustainable forest policies of the World Bank garnered significant international attention, with the Norwegian Agency for Development Coordination subsequently stating that [...] "it can [...] truly be said that RFN and its partners [...] turned around the entire forest and indigenous policies of this huge African country".|$|E

[...] Camazotz is described as being similar to Earth, with familiar birch, pines, and maple trees, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which [...] "might {{have been one of}} any number of familiar towns". Its ordinary appearance becomes less so as the children see that everything is endlessly duplicated without variation (except for one noncomforming boy, who is later punished). [...] Thus, the houses are [...] "all exactly alike, small square boxes painted gray"; this characterization has been compared with [...] "the burgeoning American suburbia" [...] such as the post-war housing developments of Levittown, Pennsylvania. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the houses are similarly described, with [...] "mother figures" [...] who [...] "all gave the appearance of being the same".

[...] It is stated that Camazotz is a planet that has [...] "given in(to the Black Thing" [...] which implies that it was once a free world that was conquered by the Black Thing, which gave rise to IT's presence on the planet. The world is said to have a psychological significance for the character Meg, in that the pressure to conform there is similar to the pressures she faces in the small town where she lives. The name Camazotz refers to a Mayan bat god.|$|E

[...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, then let it be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms clods, then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, so that your people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another.
