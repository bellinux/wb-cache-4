5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to {{eyewitness}} accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person {{view and}} {{gameplay}} places {{a greater emphasis}} on finding items and solving riddles than combat. Psychological aspects such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter were added to the game. More humanoid than <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preceding game, some of the monsters were designed to reflect James' subconscious. References to history, films and literature can also be found in the game.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-12th century Ireland {{was ruled}} {{by a number of}} local kings, {{although}} their authority was more limited than <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of western Europe. Mainstream Europeans regarded the Irish as relatively barbarous and backward. In the 1160s King Diarmait Mac Murchada was deposed as King of Leinster by the High King of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. Diarmait turned to Henry for assistance in 1167, and the English king agreed to allow Diarmait to recruit mercenaries within his empire. Diarmait put together a force of Anglo-Norman and Flemish mercenaries drawn from the Welsh Marches, including Richard de Clare. With his new supporters, he reclaimed Leinster but died shortly afterwards in 1171; de Clare then claimed Leinster for himself. The situation in Ireland was tense and the Anglo-Normans heavily outnumbered.|$|E

5|$|The {{region has}} two major factions within it – the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, {{both of whom}} differ to <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. While the Enclave is similar in goal to their western brethren, the eastern branch of the Brotherhood of Steel seeks to assist {{the people of the}} wasteland, though a small group {{rejected}} this and became outcasts who seek to resume their original goal of salvaging high-level technology. Other factions include a small group of former slaves who seek to inspire others for freedom by restoring the Lincoln Memorial, a group of wastelanders that feast on blood, and a group who tend and care for a region of the wastes where plants have become abundant.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, the player {{controls}} one of a select few characters directly based upon <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Naruto anime and manga. Clash of Ninja {{is a member of the}} fighting game genre; the player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's AI or by another player, depending on the mode that the player is in. The objective is to reduce the opponent's health to zero using basic attacks and special techniques unique to each character that are derived from techniques they use in the Naruto anime or manga. For instance, Naruto Uzumaki is able to use his signature Shadow Clone Technique, and Rock Lee utilizes many of his Strong Fist style techniques. To use these techniques, characters have available a chakra bar, which depletes upon the execution of a special technique, and regenerates over time. In the game's numerous modes, the player can choose from different styles of play. The game's story mode follows the plot from the anime and manga, and a versus mode pitting two players against each other also included.|$|E
50|$|Distribution of {{subunits}} of Laniatores is {{very interesting}} from the biogeographic point of view. The Travunioidea are typical of northern temperate regions while <b>the</b> Triaenonychoidea make <b>their</b> <b>counterpart</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern temperate regions. The other superfamilies are tropical, with many noteworthy endemisms and transcontinental relationships.|$|R

However, as globalization increases and capital and labor become more mobile, employers outside the U.S. are adopting American union-avoidance tactics, and comprehensive campaigns are becoming more common in Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Travancore was characterised by the {{popularity}} of its rulers among their subjects. The kings of Travancore, unlike <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other princely states of India, spent {{only a small portion}} of their state's resources for personal use. This was in sharp contrast with some of the northern Indian kings. Since they spent most of the state's revenue for the benefit of the public, they were naturally much loved by their subjects.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} 1950s, {{isolation}} {{from the rest of}} the world started to diminish, leading to Turkish architects being increasingly inspired by <b>their</b> <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the world. However they were constrained by the lack of technological infrastructure or insufficient financial resources till the 1980s. Thereafter, the liberalization of the economy and the shift towards export-led growth, paved the way for the private sector to become the leading influence on architecture.|$|E
