5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began to license the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine tools were transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver <b>typewriters</b> ended in May 1959.|$|E
50|$|The IBM Electromatic <b>typewriter</b> was {{the first}} {{electric}} <b>typewriter</b> to enjoy long-term commercial success. Unlike the later IBM Selectric <b>typewriter,</b> this <b>typewriter</b> model used a conventional moving carriage and typebar mechanism.|$|R
50|$|During that period, Syracuse {{was home}} to four <b>typewriter</b> {{companies}} including L. C. Smith & Bros., The Monarch <b>Typewriter</b> Company, Remington <b>Typewriter</b> Company and Smith Premier <b>Typewriter</b> Works.

5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated <b>typewriters,</b> duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York City, Omaha, St. Louis, San Francisco and Seattle, all of which closed when Oliver shifted to mail order sales in March 1917. A minor recession in 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their <b>typewriters.</b> The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E

Smith & Bros. <b>Typewriter</b> Company, founded by Lyman C. Smith and later known as Smith-Corona. Additionally, the Monarch <b>Typewriter</b> Company and Remington <b>Typewriter</b> Company, located at 111 Dickerson Street and later named Remington Rand, Inc.|$|R
50|$|In 1886, E. Remington and Sons {{sold its}} <b>typewriter</b> {{business}} and {{the rights to the}} Remington name to the Standard <b>Typewriter</b> Manufacturing Company which in 1902 changed its name to Remington <b>Typewriter</b> Company. In 1927 Rand Kardex merged with Remington <b>Typewriter.</b> The new company was called Remington Rand, and Kardex was a division and brand of that company.|$|R
5|$|On 15 July 1942, Mihailović sent a {{telegram}} to the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{asking them to}} publicly denounce Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over BBC Radio. In October, Ljotić was forced to withdraw his two representatives in the Serbian puppet government {{in order to avoid}} being held responsible for the unpopular and difficult economic measures and food policies enacted by Nedić that month. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić. Ljotić later provided Đurišić with weapons, food, <b>typewriters,</b> and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{originally}} headquartered at Pines Bridge Inn on Croton Lake, {{moved its}} headquarters to the Holbrook Military Academy, {{and the academic}} building at the school became Field Hospital No. 2 of the Atlantic Division of the American Red Cross. The ground floor of the west wing and the mess hall {{on the first floor}} was turned into a large, well-heated office with glass-partitioned private offices, and equipped with <b>typewriters</b> and mimeograph machines. The new regimental office had strong contrast with their Pines Bridge Inn office, it having been drafty, dirt-floored and poorly-lit. The site opened for their use on October 8, 1918, and the regiment fully demobilized on February 1, 1919. A reunion was held at the former school grounds for many of the troops from March 23 to 25, 1919.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror title, Resident Evil 2 features {{the same basic}} gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check {{the condition of the}} protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner {{during the course of the}} story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain <b>typewriters</b> that the player may use to save the game. However, each save expends one of a limited number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real-time generated– and thus movable– polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles.|$|E

25|$|The {{determination}} of a make and/or model of <b>typewriter</b> is a 'classification' problem and several {{systems have been}} developed for this purpose. These include the original Haas <b>Typewriter</b> Atlases (Pica version) and (Non-Pica version) and the TYPE system developed by Dr. Philip Bouffard, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Termatrex <b>Typewriter</b> classification system, and the Interpol's <b>Typewriter</b> classification system, among others.|$|R
25|$|In Latin America and Africa, {{mechanical}} <b>typewriters</b> {{are still}} common {{because they can}} be used without electrical power. In Latin America, the <b>typewriters</b> used are most often Brazilian models – Brazil continues to produce mechanical (Facit) and electronic (Olivetti) <b>typewriters</b> to the present day.|$|E
25|$|A rather {{specialized}} {{market for}} <b>typewriters</b> exists {{due to the}} regulations of many correctional systems in the US, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own <b>typewriters.</b> The Swintec corporation (headquartered in Moonachie, New Jersey), which, as of 2011, still produced <b>typewriters</b> at its overseas factories (in Japan, Indonesia, and/or Malaysia), manufactures a variety of <b>typewriters</b> for use in prisons, made of clear plastic (to {{make it harder for}} prisoners to hide prohibited items inside it). As of 2011, the company had contracts with prisons in 43 US states.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its electronic successors, the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC), the Mag Card Selectric Composer, and the Electronic Selectric Composer, IBM also made electronic <b>typewriters</b> with proportional spacing using the Selectric element that were considered <b>typewriters</b> or word processors instead of typesetting machines.|$|E
