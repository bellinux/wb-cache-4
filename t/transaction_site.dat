Online communities have changed the game for retail firms, forcing them to change their business strategies. Companies have to network more, adjust computations, and alter their organizational structures. This leads to changes in a company's communications with their manufacturers including the information shared and made accessible for further productivity and profits. Because consumers and customers in all fields are becoming accustomed to more interaction and engagement online, adjustments must be considered made {{in order to keep}} audiences intrigued.|$|E
50|$|While the neuroprotective {{effects of}} Epo {{administration}} in models of brain injury and disease {{have been well}} described, the effects of Epo on Neuroregeneration are currently being investigated. Epo administration during optic nerve transaction {{was used to assess}} the neuroprotective properties in vivo as well as demonstrate the neuroregenerative capabilities. The intravitreal injection of Epo increased retinal ganglion cell somata and axon survival after transaction. A small amount of axons penetrated the <b>transaction</b> <b>site</b> and regenerated up to 1 mm into the distal nerve. In a second experiment, Epo doubled the number of retinal ganglion cell axons regenerating along a length of nerve grafted onto the retrobulbar optic nerve. This evidence of Epo as a neuroprotective and neuroregenerative agent is extremely promising for Epo as therapy in central nerve injury and repair.|$|E

The Results of our research suggest that much of the Internet activity of companies setting up a Web site in The Netherlands, is in the category of information / presence Web sites. We have found that, by large, senior management was the initiator of setting up Internet activities. About half of the companies reviewed, did not have a defined Internet strategy or implementation plan. In the companies that did have a defined Internet strategy, it was developed by management.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new read-only optimization called the unsolicited update [...] vote that {{when combined with}} the presumed commit protocol (PrC), eliminates all the logging activities from PrC for read-only transactions and significantly reduces them for partially read-only ones. 1 INTRODUCTION To ensure consistent termination of distributed <b>transactions</b> despite <b>site</b> and communication failures, all the sites participating in a transaction's execution engage in an atomic commit protocol (ACP). The two-phase commit (2 PC) protocol [1] is the simplest and most used ACP. Since 2 PC consumes {{a substantial amount of}} a transaction's execution time due to the cost of its coordination messages and forced log writes to stable storage required for recovery, a number of 2 PC variants appear in the literature, most notably, presumed abort (PrA) and presumed commit (PrC) [2]. As opposed to PrA, PrC has been designed to reduce the cost associated with committing transactions rather than aborting ones [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|A major {{promise of}} the Internet is its {{potential}} for online shopping and its benefits {{in the form of}} cost reduction, for consumers and businesses alike. For example, according to Penton Research (www. penton. com), using the Web site as a marketing tool provides a compelling means for cost reduction in terms of cost per contact statistics (Internet: $ 0. 98, direct mail: $ 1. 68, telemarketing: $ 31. 16, tradeshows: $ 162). Yet the new medium is far from the true electronic marketplace of the future. This is due largely to the reluctance of consumers to engage in transactions over the Internet. In their study, Hoffman, Novak and Peralta found that consumers, on the Web, may fear providing credit card information to any commercial Web provider and that consumers simply do not trust most Web providers enough to engage in exchange relationships involving money [4]. This perceived risk among consumers translates into their reluctance to use debit and/or credit card information over the Internet resulting in their disengagement from electronic <b>transactions.</b> Most <b>sites</b> on the Internet today do not focus on building and nurturing trust as part of an ongoing relationship with their customers [7, 9].

40|$|Global {{transaction}} management requires {{cooperation from}} local sites {{to ensure the}} consistent and reliable execution of global transactions in a distributed database system.

40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of Grid environments for eScience applications led to common computing infrastructures with nearly unlimited storage capabilities. In terms of data management, the Grid allows keeping {{a large number}} of replicas of data objects to allow for a high degree of availability, reliability and performance. Due to the particular characteristics of the Grid, especially due to the absence of a global coordinator, dealing with many updateable replicas per data object urgently requires new protocols for the synchronization of updates and their subsequent propagation. Currently there is no protocol which can be seamlessly applied to a data Grid environment without impacting correctness and/or overall performance. In this paper we address the problem of replication in the Data Grid in the presence of updates. We have designed the Re:GRIDiT protocol that focuses on the correct synchronization of updates to several replicas in the Grid in a completely distributed way, extending well-established database replication techniques. Globally correct execution is provided by communication between <b>transactions</b> and <b>sites.</b> Re:GRIDiT takes into account the special characteristics of eScience applications such as the distinction between mutable objects, that can be updated by users and immutable objects. Finally, we provide a detailed evaluation of the performance of the Re:GRIDiT protocol when being applied at Grid scale.

If there are no spatial relationships between the two objects that are concurrently being updated at different sites, parallel updates will be completely allowed.
