50|$|Babinet was {{interested}} in the optical properties of minerals throughout his career. He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the polariscope and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The Babinet compensator, an accessory useful in polarized light microscopy, was built with <b>twin,</b> <b>opposed</b> quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy. This design avoids the problems inherent in the basic quartz wedge, where the zero reading coincides with the thin end of the wedge, which is often lost when grinding the plate during manufacture.|$|R
40|$|Production systems {{must have}} the right type of {{material}} in the right quantities when required for production. They must minimize the work in progress while ensuring no stock-outstock-out occurs. While these <b>twin</b> <b>opposing</b> goals are achievable when demand is stable, they are difficult to realize under an erratic demand pattern. This dissertation aims to develop a production system that can meet erratic demands with minimal costs or errors. After a detailed introduction to the problem considered, we review the relevant literature. We then conduct a numerical analysis of current production systems, identify their deficiencies, and then present our solution to address these deficiencies via the ARK (Automated Replenishment System) technique. This technique is applied to a real-world problem at Methode Engineering ©. We conclude by detailing the scientific benefit of our technique and proposing ideas for future research...|$|R

50|$|In 1974 {{two young}} Whataroa brothers, Kevin and Rodney Giles, formed the Duzgo Manufacturing Company {{to make a}} small two wheel drive light utility vehicle for use {{primarily}} on farms. Their creation, called the Duzgo was made using assorted Austin and Morris parts, a single-cylinder Kohler 12 hp engine and a double gearbox giving 12 forward and three reverse gears. Later models used a Robin 14-16 hp <b>twin</b> <b>opposed</b> engine. It was light and ran on knobbly motorcycle tyres which gave it excellent traction in muddy farm conditions. In all 10 were made by 1979 before the Customs Department determined that they were a vehicle manufacturing business and therefore needed to pay 30% sales tax on each vehicle. This effectively ended their business. In 2004 a Duzgo featured in the BBC series Billy Connolly's World Tour of New Zealand. There is a Duzgo (possibly number 1) in the Coaltown Museum, Queen Street, Westport and several still remain in use.|$|R

2500|$|In , the Expos drew only 642,748 fans, {{one of the}} {{smallest}} totals in MLB in decades. The minority partners, whose interest was now reduced to a combined seven percent, became convinced that Loria had planned his moves to force them out. [...] When pleas to Selig and MLB officials fell on deaf ears, the group became convinced that Selig and Loria had conspired to force the Expos out of Montreal. At the same time, MLB took steps to vote on contraction and eliminating both the Expos and the Minnesota Twins. On November 6, 2001, MLB's owners voted 28–2 on contraction; only the Expos and <b>Twins</b> <b>opposed.</b> Initial plans called for the Expos and Twins to play a lame-duck season in [...] before their franchises were revoked. Both teams were saved following a legal challenge filed in Minnesota that forced MLB to honour the Twins' lease with their stadium, as well as challenges by the MLBPA. As MLB was unable to find another candidate for contraction, the immediate threat for the Expos diminished, as MLB needed to keep an even number of teams to maintain its schedule.|$|R

40|$|The {{current work}} focuses on extracting useful {{statistical}} information from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements, complemented by Hot Wire Anemometry (HWA) measurements. Experiments {{were conducted in}} the turbulent opposed jet geometry, which is a canonical configuration for understanding the fundamentals of flow and combustion. Novel fractal grids were used to generate turbulence in the flow, and turbulent characteristics of the flow field were extracted to ascertain the relative effects of flow configuration on the flow characteristics, including lengthscale and energy information, using energy spectra and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Lean premixed flames were measured using PIV, and novel techniques used to extract unconditional velocity statistics, bulk motion and rotation effects, conditional statistics, turbulent burning velocities, flame surface density (FSD), thickness of turbulent flame brush and instantaneous reaction zone, flame surface area, conditional dissipation, as well as conditional POD (CPOD). These were made accessible via density segregation, a multi-step image processing algorithm, used to detect flame isocontours directly from PIV images. Relative effects of flow and chemistry were investigated for lean premixed <b>twin</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flames, using methane, propane, ethylene, cyclopentane and JP- 10 as fuels. In addition, the transition to flameless oxidation from conventional premixed flames was also characterised using methane, cyclopentane, cyclopentene and JP- 10, via a Damkohler number analysis.

40|$|A {{study of}} 1045 twin gestations {{with regard to}} known or likely zygosity and the {{incidence}} of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia failed to reveal differences between known dizygous twins and like-sex 'presumed' and 'estimated' monozygous twins except in the 'estimated' data for multigravidae. There was a threefold increase in the incidence for <b>twins</b> as <b>opposed</b> to singleton pregnancies. These results are discussed in relation to increased conceptus-mother antigenic differences. It is suggested {{that the risk of}} gestosis in twin pregnancy involves more than a summation of that operating in two singleton pregnancies...|$|R

By contrast, Myung-su works as a bouncer at a local brothel and helps out in his mother's restaurant, but is happy to trade places with his brother whenever there is trouble. The two brothers have their lives turned upside down when Hyung-su is accused of a crime.|$|R
40|$|Mixtures of {{fuel and}} air ignite spontaneously if exposed to {{sufficiently}} high temperatures. Such ignition is not an instantaneous event, and {{there is always a}} delay of chemical origin between the establishment of the par-ticular conditions of temperature and pressure and the rapid, exothermic chemical reactions that constitute ignition. This delay is of outstanding importance in any fuel application in which spontaneous ignition plays a part. It is determined by the progress of the near-isothermal chemical processes that precede ignition, and these processes therefore merit continued study. This paper describes the development of an experimental technique which allows these studies to be extended to much higher pressures than those accessible in glass vessels, while retaining many of the advantages of labo-ratory vessel experiments. This technique is centred on a rapid compression machine of novel design which is used to heat and compress fuel/air mixtures to conditions near those in a knocking engine. After this com-pression process, which occupies a few milliseconds only, the hot, high pressure charge is held at constant volume while thermochemical, spectroscopic or analytical observations are made. The principal new developments in the machine are the use of <b>twin</b> <b>opposed</b> pistons for compression with an associated hydraulic synchronizing system and a precisely triggered valve that enables rapid quenching and sampling of the reacting mixture to be made at an appropriate stage of reaction...|$|R
