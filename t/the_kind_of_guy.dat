Fishburne stated that he modeled his {{character}} after Ed Bradley, stating that [...] "my inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... legendary Ed Bradley... was a friend, a mentor, and {{a role model for}} me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and he was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry." ...|$|E
500|$|Classmates {{believed}} [...] "the plays {{were really}} morbid and grotesque." [...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, he turned to his roommate and said, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymond {{took the}} war in Europe seriously enough to {{incorporate}} it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself {{involved in the conflict}} too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming [...] "restive about doing his duty", a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. [...] In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon/Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating [...] "I just had to get into this fight... I've always been <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who gets a lump in his throat when a band plays the 'Star Spangled Banner'".|$|E
5000|$|Allie X {{describes}} the album's tracks as representing pieces of her. [...] "Whether it'd be a dream, a fantasy or my interpretation of reality," [...] she {{said about the}} tracks. [...] "Paper Love" [...] {{and many of the}} other songs are about that part of myself that is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> impulsive and self-destructive, and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> I dated for a while. I know that now that I'm older a lot of that I've grown out of, but other parts I haven't out of so much. It definitely is a piece of the me that I am now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Moe Howard and Larry Fine {{discussed}} {{plans to}} tour {{with a live}} act, but Besser declined. His wife had {{suffered a heart attack}} in November 1957, and he was unwilling to leave without her. In later life, Besser praised Moe and Larry in a 1985 radio interview, of which a quote from said interview was aired on A&E Network's Biography. Besser said: [...] "...Moe and Larry, they were the best. I enjoyed every minute of it with them. In fact, to show you how wonderful they were, I never liked to be hit with anything.

500|$|Lofton, who {{appeared}} in 83 games with the Yankees, felt manager Joe Torre did not use his skills appropriately. Lofton finished the regular season with a [...]275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for a player with post-season experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, which {{as part of the}} deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodríguez. After the trade, Lofton stated, [...] "It's been very tough. I'm <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> that likes to be settled down. It's been very tough the last three or four years. Everyone in New York understood I wanted to play. I just wanted an opportunity to perform and be a part of the team. I didn't feel as much of a part of the team." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Chili Peppers' {{contract}} with EMI {{came to an}} end, they began {{looking for a new}} record company to release their next album. The group reached a consensus to go with Sony BMG/Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI. Even though the label promised it would take only a few days, the process stretched out into several months. Although a deal had been made with Sony/Epic, Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "The coolest, most real person we had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage me to make a great record for a rival company. That was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> I'd want to be working for." [...] The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the {{contract with}} Sony in favor of a deal with Warner Bros. Ostin called an old friend at EMI, who immediately allowed for the label transfer.|$|E
500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career-high 34 passes for 322 yards. [...] "Joe was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> you'd love to play your whole career with," [...] said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. [...] "He was older when we got him, but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard." [...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2002, Mayor Anthony A. Williams {{announced}} {{an investigation into}} two assistant chiefs and a deputy chief who also may have been improperly hired by Few. Williams said Assistant Chief Marcus Anderson, Assistant Chief Gary Garland, and Deputy Chief Bruce Cowan falsified their résumés by claiming high-level jobs they did not hold and listing certification and educational credentials they never earned. Few had initially raised department morale in August 2000 by reversing a number of transfers ordered by former interim Fire Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe (and viewed as punitive by the rank and file). But the hiring of Anderson, Garland, and Cowan deeply undercut morale again. [...] "The people [...] promoted were not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> that got things done," [...] one battalion chief said. [...] "I think the odds of an insider getting things done ... are probably better".|$|R
5000|$|While on {{tour with}} The Black Crowes, Buffalo Killers wrote {{half of what}} would become Let It Ride. The band entered the studio, with Black Keys guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach serving as producer, {{immediately}} following the tour. [...] The recording session took [...] "only a few days", according to Auerbach, who downplayed his role in making the album. [...] "These are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> that don't {{need a lot of}} help {{when it comes to making}} records or sparking their imagination." [...] Auerbach felt his most important contribution was in capturing [...] "the raw live sound of this band". [...] A concert tour, on which Buffalo Killers opened for The Black Keys, preceded the July 22, 2008, release of Let It Ride. [...] A bonus live CD, sourced from a fan's bootleg, was included in a limited edition vinyl pressing of the album. The inclusion was made (even though the bootleg [...] "sounds like shit", said Zach) to show that the band can play live and is not studio-enhanced. [...] Another tour opening for The Black Crowes followed in November.|$|R
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered he was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E
500|$|Dufek {{was drafted}} by the Seahawks with the second {{selection}} of fifth round and 126th overall selection of the 1976 NFL Draft. [...] Dufek {{was one of the}} original Seahawks in 1976, the franchise's first year in the NFL, and he played for them until 1984. He was the captain of the Seahawks' special teams units in 1981 and 1982. [...] During both of these seasons he was co-captain along with eventual Pro Football Hall of Famer and four-term representative in United States House of Representatives, Steve Largent, the captain of the offensive unit and Keith Simpson, captain of the defensive unit. [...] Over the course of his career he had three interceptions, two quarterback sacks, a fumble recovery and thirteen kickoff returns. [...] Sportswriter Richard Kucner once wrote: [...] "Don Dufek was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who just won't take 'No' for an answer. He was released in training camp four times during his eight-year Seahawks career. But each time, Seattle had a change of heart, bringing him back. Today, he is remembered {{as one of the best}} special teams performers the team has had." ...|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And he was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I {{would like to have}} a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E

5000|$|By 2008, {{the party}} scene had declined, {{with the new}} areas of the Greater Houston club scene being Downtown Houston, Midtown Houston, and Washington Avenue. As of 2008, 1990s music plays in many area clubs, and many establishments use [...] "z" [...] in place of [...] "s", such as [...] "Dreamz" [...] instead of [...] "Dreams." [...] John Nova Lomax of the Houston Press said [...] "It’s a life of, as Wash Allen from KCOH would put it, 'dealing with' strippers, or dealing with <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> who are {{attracted}} to dealing with that sort of thing. As a philosophy. It’s full of apartment poolside parties, bad cocaine, the occasional dose of clap, tanning bedz, jello shotz, big ass beerz, and cold Jager machinez." [...] Lomax concluded [...] "And it seems that Houston no longer really wants the Richmond Strip. Sure, a few holdovers from the glory days remain, such as the Sam’s Boat empire, Centerfolds, La Bare (where “Cannon” from New Orleans is scheduled to appear), Dave and Buster’s and so on, but you {{think that all of}} these place would leap at any favorable lease they could get inside the loop." [...] In 2010 Craig Hlavaty, Shea Serrano, and Mike Giglio of the Houston Press said that the Richmond Strip was [...] "Houston's last real nightclub row" [...] before the emergence of Washington Avenue.|$|R
