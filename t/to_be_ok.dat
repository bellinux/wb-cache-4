500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: [...] "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with his vanquishing." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but I could go and go and go. I've had to learn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with it." ...|$|E

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK?</b> It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

Montgomery noted that the [...] "throughly sad song [...] about Robyn losing her man to another woman, but also about the notion of feeling alone in a crowded room, of being lost and unloved and having no other choice but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with those things." [...] The song features lines such as, [...] "I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her. I'm right over here, why can't you see me? I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home." [...] In contrast to [...] "With Every Heartbeat" [...] being [...] "grimly optimistic", a The Guardian writer noted that [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] offers [...] "no hope that things may get better."

[...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Titans {{were also}} {{the first team to}} play in the Regular season, when they played the Steelers on September 10. Ringer was used to return kicks. In the 10-13 {{overtime}} loss, Ringer had 3 Kick Returns, a 19 yard average, including a long of 21 yards. He also played on special teams, and had one tackle. Ringer was again used as a kick returner, this time in a 31-34 loss to the Houston Texans. Ringer had 6 returns for a 20 yard average, with a long of 25, and no touchdowns. He also played on special teams, but had no tackles. In a 17-24 week 3 loss to the New York Jets, Ringer was benched as the kick returner, and, while active, did not play in the game. Ringer's kick return replacement, Ryan Mouton, had two fumbles during returns. Despite this, Titan's coach Jeff Fischer stood behind his decision to bench Ringer. In a 37-17 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was again active, but only played as a reserve on special teams. Ringer was one of three Titans who did not register a stat. The Titans, who last year had 13 wins, only three losses, started the season out zero wins four losses. They had their fifth loss of the season in a 31-9 loss to the Colts, a game in which Ringer was once again active, but only played special teams, not registering a stat. Ringer was one of two Titans that did not record an offensive stat. In a record-breaking 59-0 loss to the New England Patriots, Ringer had his first NFL carries, having 7 carries for 47 yards (6.7 average), including a 32 yard run, for no touchdowns, all amounting in Garbage time. The Titans finished the game with negative 7 passing yards as their record moved to 0 wins 6 losses, putting them in a tie for the worst record in the NFL alongside the St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Despite his performance in the loss, head coach Jeff Fisher said that Chris Johnson and LenDale White will continue to get the majority of the carries. [...] "There's not enough balls to go around. I wouldn't hesitate to put Ringer in if there's an issue," [...] Fisher said. During a practice on October 28, 2009, Ringer injured his back and had to be carted off in an ambulance. Fisher said of the injury [...] "It could be any number of things and it would be unfair for me to speculate right now. He is obviously in some pain." [...] The call to the hospital was initially phoned to treat a potentially [...] "traumatic" [...] injury, but tests have revealed that the injury is [...] "not considered serious". After spending a night with back problems, Ringer was released from the hospital early morning on October 29. Ringer's expected to miss a few weeks, as he's listed on the injury report with a back injury. Fisher commented on the injury, [...] "We got some good news on Javon. He obviously didn’t practice today, but he’s going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK.</b> We were really concerned about it. We feared the worst and we got good results," [...] but would not elaborate as to {{the full extent of the}} injury. In a 30-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ringer was declared inactive before the game, and did not play. It was however, the Titans first victory of the season. In week 9, Ringer was again inactive and did not play. In week 10, Ringer was listed as questionable, but was declared inactive, and did not play. In a 20-17 win against the Houston Texans, Ringer was inactive, and did not play. In 20-17 win against the Arizona Cardinals, Ringer was listed as the #2 running back. He had one yard on one carry. Ringer played because LenDale White, the team's usual #2 Running back, was benched due to being late to a team meeting. Ringer was then inactive for the rest of the season. Ringer finished the season with 8 attempts for 48 yards, playing in 7 games.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a multiagent resource allocation domain where the marginal production of each resource is diminishing. A set of identical, self-interested agents requires access to sharable {{resources in the}} domain. We present a distributed and random allocation procedure, and demonstrate that the allocation converges to the optimal in terms of utilitarian social welfare. The procedure is based on direct interaction among the agents and resource owners (without {{the use of a}} central authority). We then consider potential strategic behavior of the selfinterested agents and resource owners, and show that when both act rationally and the domain is highly competitive for the resource owners, the convergence result still holds. The optimal allocation is arrived at quickly; given a setting with k resources and n agents, we demonstrate that the expected number of timesteps <b>to</b> convergence <b>is</b> <b>O(k</b> ln n), even in the worst case, where the optimal allocation is extremely unbalanced. Our allocation procedure has advantages over a mechanism design approach based on Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms: it does not require the existence of a central trusted authority, and it fully distributes the utility obtained by the agents and resource owners (i. e., it is strongly budgetbalanced) ...|$|R
