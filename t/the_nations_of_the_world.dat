When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clearly}} {{established}} {{in either the}} Gemara or the Halacha what precisely would constitute permission from the nations.

Bahá'ís believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that Bahá'í influence on the process is relatively minor.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} X-COM, {{set in the}} near-future {{at the time of}} the game's release, begins in the year 1998. The initial plot centers on {{increased}} reports of UFO sightings as tales of abductions and rumors of attacks by mysterious aliens become widespread. <b>The</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> come to perceive this as a threat and attempt to form their own forces – such as Japan's Kiryu-Kai force – to deal with the crisis, but these efforts are unsuccessful. On December 11, 1998, representatives from some of the most powerful nations in the world secretly meet in Geneva to discuss the issue. From this meeting is born the clandestine defense and research organization Extraterrestrial Combat (X-COM), over which the player assumes control at the start of the game.|$|E

The General's actions have been prompted by paranoia, arising from his own encounter with the aliens {{when he was an}} astronaut on Mars Probe Six, where he witnessed his co-pilot, Daniels, killed by merely touching one of them. Carrington's mind is broken: he has lured the three aliens to Earth in order to expose them on television, and intends to call on <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to attack them. The use of the ambassadors to kill was done simply to arouse public opinion against them. But Carrington is so mentally disturbed by his experiences that he cannot grasp the fact that the aliens can destroy the world, and cannot be defeated.|$|E
25|$|Neturei Karta {{believe that}} the exile of the Jews can only end {{with the arrival of}} the Messiah, and that human {{attempts}} to establish Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel are sinful. In Neturei Karta's view, Zionism is a presumptuous affront against God. Chief among their arguments against Zionism is the Talmudic concept of the so-called Three Oaths, extracted from the discussion of certain portions of the Bible. It states that a pact consisting of three oaths was made between God, the Jewish people, and <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> when the Jews were sent into exile. One provision of the pact was that the Jews would not rebel against the non-Jewish world that gave them sanctuary; a second was that they would not immigrate en masse to the Land of Israel. In return the gentile nations promised not to persecute the Jews. By rebelling against this pact, they argued, the Jewish people were engaging in rebellion against God.|$|E

25|$|Prophecies {{concerning}} {{the emergence of}} the Antichrist (Dajjal) are interpreted in Ahmadiyya teachings as designating a specific group of nations centred upon deception instead of an individual, with the reference to the Antichrist as an individual indicating its unity as a class rather than its personal individuality. As such, Ahmadi Muslims identify the Antichrist collectively with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of European Christianity throughout the world that was propelled by the Industrial Revolution. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote extensively on this topic identifying the Antichrist principally with colonial missionaries who, according to him, were to be countered through argumentation rather than by physical warfare, and whose power and influence was to wane gradually. While the term Dajjal is taken as a reference to the forces of falsehood in matters of ideology and religious belief, prophecies concerning Gog and Magog (or Yaʾjūj Maʾjūj) are taken as relating to the duplicity in the realm of politics and the shattering of world peace by the same forces – whose ancestors are thought to be the Slavic and Teutonic peoples – and are seen as embodied by the political dominance of European powers. The conflict between Russia and the United States as two superpowers, or the militant rivalry between the Communist and Capitalist systems and their impact over <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> are thus seen as having occurred in accordance with prophecies concerning Gog and Magog. These powers cannot be defeated through military force and are to be overcome through prayer and divine intervention. Islam is then seen as that which would succeed in uniting people of different nations as per the Quran (18:99).|$|E
