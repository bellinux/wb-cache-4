2500|$|The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster {{formulated}} {{the principle}} of [...] "order from noise" [...] in 1960.

This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a [...] "strong" [...] or [...] "deep" [...] attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself.

2500|$|A {{good example}} of {{nonlinear}} electromagnetics is in high energy dense plasmas, where vortical phenomena occur which seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics by increasing the energy gradient within the electromagnetic field and violate Maxwell's laws by creating ion currents which capture and concentrate their own and surrounding magnetic fields. In particular Lorentz force law, which elaborates Maxwell's equations is violated by these force free vortices. These apparent violations are {{due to the fact}} that the traditional conservation laws in classical and quantum electrodynamics (QED) only display linear U(1) symmetry (in particular, by the extended Noether theorem, conservation laws such as the laws of thermodynamics need not always apply to dissipative systems, which are expressed in gauges of higher symmetry). The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed linear system entropy flow can only be positive (or exactly zero at the end of a cycle). However, negative entropy (i.e. increased order, structure or self-organisation) can spontaneously appear in an open nonlinear thermodynamic system that is far from equilibrium, so long as this emergent order accelerates the overall flow of entropy in the total system. The 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to <b>thermodynamicist</b> Ilya Prigogine for his theory of dissipative systems that described this notion. Prigogine described the principle as [...] "order through fluctuations" [...] or [...] "order out of chaos". It has been argued by some that all emergent order in the universe from galaxies, solar systems, planets, weather, complex chemistry, evolutionary biology to even consciousness, technology and civilizations are themselves examples of thermodynamic dissipative systems; nature having naturally selected these structures to accelerate entropy flow within the universe to an ever-increasing degree. For example, it has been estimated that human body is 10,000 times more effective at dissipating energy per unit of mass than the sun.|$|E

40|$|In this {{monograph}} Prof. Pramanick explicates {{the law of}} motive force, {{a fundamental}} law of nature that can be observed and appreciated as an addition to the existing laws of thermodynamics. This unmistakable and remarkable tendency of nature is equally applicable to all other branches of studies. He first conceptualized the law of motive force in 1989, {{when he was an}} undergraduate student. Here he reports various applications of the law in the area of  thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, and shows how it is possible to solve analytically century-old unsolved problems through its application. This book offers a comprehensive account of the law and its relation to other laws and principles, such as the generalized conservation principle, variational formulation, Fermat’s principle, Bejan’s constructal law, entropy generation minimization, Bejan’s method of intersecting asymptotes and equipartition principle. Furthermore, the author addresses some interrelated fundamental problems of contemporary interest, especially to <b>thermodynamicists,</b> by combining analytical methods, physical reasoning and the proposed law of motive force.

40|$|The name of George Augustus Linhart {{is in fact}} "widely unknown".

40|$|A {{project has}} been {{underway}} at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) to investigate the feasibility of a combined Otto and Stirling cycle power plant in which a Stirling cycle engine {{would serve as a}} bottoming cycle for a stationary Otto cycle engine. This type of combined cycle plant is considered to have good potential for industrial use. This paper describes work by DIT and collaborators to validate a computer simulation model of the combined cycle plant. In investigating the feasibility of the type of combined cycle that is proposed there are a range of practical realities to be faced and addressed. Reliable performance data for the component engines are required over a wide range of operating conditions, but there are practical difficulties in accessing such data. A simulation model is required that is sufficiently detailed to represent all important performance aspects and that is capable of being validated. <b>Thermodynamicists</b> currently employ a diverse range of modeling, analysis and optimization techniques for the component engines and the combined cycle.

40|$|Just as {{reflection}} on international development {{is suffering from}} a certain shortness of breath, so are the dynamics of technico-industrial growth becoming weaker.

40|$|Twenty-five years ago, Gaggioli, Sama and Qian {{published}} {{a series of}} 10 “second law guidelines” for design and process engineers, nicknamed at that time “the Gaggioli-Sama rules”. These guidelines, some of them previously published by Sama between 1980 and 1983, are a compilation of “second law errors” to avoid {{in the design of}} energy conversion systems. The list was rearranged several times, until a revised version containing 21 rules was published by Sama and Szargut in 1995. Ever since, these guidelines {{came to be known as}} “the Sama-Szargut rules”. The rules are a series of well-formulated and insightful suggestions that reflect a <b>thermodynamicist’s</b> idea that the “best design” is the one that minimizes the overall irreversibility in a process or plant, under the prescribed technological constraints. Characteristically, the concept of “optimal system” is completely absent, the emphasis being on the extensive inclusion of second law reasoning into design decisions. A critical analysis of the rules would suggest that all of them be routinely implemented both in new designs and most important in retrofit projects. A survey of some of the current most common energy conversion installations shows that, quite on the contrary, most of the rules are disregarded in practical applications. This paper argues that the reason for this incongruency is the neglection in the engineering design decision of the real cost of installation, operation and decommissioning of a plant, and proposes a rephrasing of the rules in an extended exergy perspective: if the production cost, including the externalities, is measured in units of equivalent primary exergy, the Sama-Szargut rules can be directly interpreted in this sense, and abidance by the rules results in the reduction of the resource cost for any given objective...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the CAPRA project, fast reactor designs {{suitable}} for plutonium burning are presently under study, in cooperation with the Centre d'Etudes Nucleaire in Cadarache, France. Different fuel types are of interest, and as the project involves also safety investigations, thermodynamic data of these fuels are required. This report deals with thermodynamic data and the equation of state of uranium metal. Besides for the project, the equation of state is also of basic interest. High-temperature thermodynamic properties of uranium were measured already in the 1960 's, during the period when metallic uranium was used as a fuel in both thermal and fast nuclear reactors. Later on, when oxides were the preferred reactor fuel, the main interest of <b>thermodynamicists</b> shifted towards oxides of uranium and plutonium. In 1976, an IAEA international team, Ref (1) carried out a critical analysis, and summarized their results. They also produced tables of the standard thermodynamic functions, i. e. essentially heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy of the liquid and the gas. The liquid density, however, was not included in their analysis. More recently, their results were updated by the CODATA team, Cox et al., Ref (2), and later on by Cordfunke and Konings, Ref (3). The tables in the three publications show very similar data. This is not surprising because very few additional results pertaining to the standard thermal functions became available in the meantime. However, new measurements of the liquid density were performed, Ref (4, 5); they will be discussed later because of their importance, and their bearing on the equation of state. The properties of the different solid phases are well known. This paper is concerned with the liquid phase (above the melting point, assumed to be at 1408 K). A summary and a critical discussion of the available data will be given, and their consistency examined. Furthermore, there are now enough data on the lqiuid density available to warrant an extrapolation to the critical point by the method of rectilinear diameter. Such an extrapolation will be carried out, and the resulting critical parameters will be compared to earlier extrapolations. In addition, the densities and enthalpies will be calculated. (orig.)
