25|$|<b>Testamentary</b> <b>trust</b> (or Will Trust): A trust {{created in}} an individual's will {{is called a}} <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust.</b> Because a will can become {{effective}} only upon death, a <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust</b> is generally created at or following {{the date of the}} settlor's death.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with the Will of the first Rajah, Sir James Brooke, the line of succession to the 'sovereignty of Sarawak and all the rights and privileges whatsoever thereto belonging,' was to the heirs male lawfully begotten of the Rajah's nephew Charles Anthony Johnson Brooke. Charles inherited under the Will in 1868, and confirmed the succession in his own will of 1913. On his accession in 1918, his son Vyner (later Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak) swore to uphold the Will 'as forming {{the constitution of the}} state'. This unique <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust</b> became known as 'The Sarawak Sovereignty Trust'.|$|E
25|$|A {{discretionary}} trust in Canadian and English trusts {{law is a}} trust where the beneficiaries and/or their entitlements to the trust fund are not fixed, but {{are determined by the}} criteria set out in the trust instrument by the settlor. It is sometimes referred to as a family trust in Australia or New Zealand. Where the {{discretionary trust}} is a <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust,</b> it is common for the settlor to leave a letter of wishes for the trustees to guide them as to the settlor's wishes in the exercise of their discretion. Letters of wishes are not legally binding documents.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{critically}} analyses the English {{choice of}} law rules for <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts.</b> After outlining the research context (Chapter 1), the key concepts and terms for <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts</b> in cross-border estates are introduced (Chapter 2). The dual system of {{choice of law}} rules (one for testate succession {{and the other for}} the trust) are discussed with reference to reads 'rocket and rocket-launcher' illustration that has been favoured by legislators and commentators alike. Thus, the current choice of law rules for testate succession matters are analysed in Chapter 3 and the choice of law rules for trusts are examined in Chapter 4. This leads to Chapter 5 concluding that the choice of law rules for the creation of <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts</b> (the rocket-launching aspects) are particularly problematic. The discussion thereafter focuses on how the choice of law rules for the rocket-launching aspects of <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts</b> could be improved with reference to the international and European reform attempts to legislate on succession and trusts, including the Hague Succession Convention and the European Succession Regulation (Chapter 6). Moreover, the limited UK reform attempts relevant to the choice of law rules for <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts</b> are discussed in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 proposes recommendations for reform...|$|R

25|$|During the Great Depression Edward Ball, who {{controlled}} the Alfred I. duPont <b>Testamentary</b> <b>Trust,</b> bought a majority ownership of FEC, buying its bonds {{on the open}} market, allowing the FEC to emerge from bankruptcy following protracted litigation {{with a group of}} the company's other bondholders, led by S.A. Lynch and associated with the Atlantic Coast Line which had proposed an alternate plan of reorganization. That same year, a labor contract negotiation turned sour. Ball was determined to save the railroad from the bankruptcy that had continued for more than a decade. Ball was certain that if the company didn't become profitable, the equipment and track would deteriorate to the point where some lines would become unsafe or unusable and require partial abandonment.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust</b> {{is created}} by a will and arises {{after the death of}} the settlor. [...] An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor's {{lifetime}} by a trust instrument. [...] A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in California, Oklahoma and Texas, in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable. [...] An irrevocable trust can be [...] "broken" [...] (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{potential}} problems, lawyers often advise that a revocable living trust or inter vivos trust be created instead of a <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust.</b> However, a <b>testamentary</b> <b>trust</b> {{may be a better}} solution if the expected estate is small compared to potential life-insurance settlement amounts.|$|E

50|$|A settlor {{may create}} a trust by manifesting an {{intention}} to create it. In most countries no formalities are required to create an inter vivos trust over personal property, but there are often formalities associated with trusts over real property, or <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts.</b> The words or acts of the settlor must be sufficient to establish an intention that either another person or the settlor himself shall be trustee of the property the beneficiary; a general intention to benefit another person on its own is sufficient. These formalities apply to express trusts only, and not to resulting, implied or constructive trusts.|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} the tension between two competing aspects of public policy, namely, the desire to avoid dispositions which have no useful purpose {{and the need to}} preserve the testator's freedom to dispose of his property as he wishes. The writers' conclusion is that the English, Scottish, Commonwealth and American case law demonstrates an underlying rationale for the rule against capricious purposes grounded in the notion that the law will not enforce <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts</b> for private purposes which amount to an uneconomic and extravagant deployment of resources which either manifestly impair the economic interests of the beneficiaries and/or adversely impact on the community generally...|$|R

50|$|It {{is certain}} {{from the text}} of Gaius that the {{earliest}} forms of will were those made in the comitia calata and those made in procinctu, or {{on the eve of}} battle. The former were published before the comitia, as representative of the patrician genies, and were originally a legislative act. These wills were the peculiar privilege of patricians. At a later time the form of plebeian will developed (irs/amentum per aes ci libram), and the law of testamentary succession was further modified by the influence of tile practor, especially in the direction of recognition of fideicommissa similar in some respects to <b>testamentary</b> <b>trusts.</b> Codicilli, or informal wills, also came into use and were sufficient for almost every purpose except for appointing an heir.|$|R
