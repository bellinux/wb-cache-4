2500|$|In April 1975 at the Hannover Fair, Olivetti {{presented}} the P6060, the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system. The {{central processing unit}} consisted of two cards, code named PUCE1 and PUCE2, and unlike most other personal computers was built with TTL components rather than a microprocessor. It had one or two 8" [...] floppy disk drives, a 32-character plasma display, 80-column graphical <b>thermal</b> <b>printer,</b> 48 Kbytes of RAM, and BASIC language. It weighed [...] As a complete system, this was a significant step from the Altair, though it never achieved the same success. It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive.|$|E
50|$|Label {{printers}} use a {{wide range}} of label materials, including paper and synthetic polymer ("plastic") materials. Several types of print mechanisms are also used, including laser and impact, but <b>thermal</b> <b>printer</b> mechanisms are probably the most common. There are two common types of <b>thermal</b> <b>printer.</b>|$|E

The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>printers</b> work by {{selectively}} heating {{regions of}} special heat-sensitive paper. Monochrome <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> {{are used in}} cash registers, ATMs, gasoline dispensers and some older inexpensive fax machines. Colours can be achieved with special papers and different temperatures and heating rates for different colours; these coloured sheets are not required in black-and-white output. One example is Zink (a portmanteau of [...] "zero ink").|$|R
50|$|Fax {{machines}} {{from the}} 1970s to the 1990s often used direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, {{but since the}} mid-1990s {{there has been a}} transition towards plain-paper faxes:- <b>thermal</b> transfer <b>printers,</b> inkjet printers and laser printers.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} barcode {{printers}} employ {{one of two}} different printing technologies. Direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> use a printhead to generate heat that causes a chemical reaction in specially designed paper that turns the paper black. <b>Thermal</b> transfer <b>printers</b> also use heat, but instead of reacting the paper, the heat melts a waxy or resin substance on a ribbon that runs over the label or tag material. The heat transfers ink from the ribbon to the paper. Direct <b>thermal</b> <b>printers</b> are generally less expensive, but they produce labels that can become illegible if exposed to heat, direct sunlight, or chemical vapors.|$|R

They are also smaller, lighter and consume less power, making them ideal for {{portable}} and retail applications. Its efficiency can be utilized in retail sectors.
