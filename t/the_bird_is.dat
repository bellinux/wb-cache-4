There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{following}} {{a flash of}} light, the stone {{at the base of}} the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to pray, and goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is {{considered}} a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> also considered {{a threat to the}} safety of aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps—as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles {{the songs of}} Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 5.9millionkm2 (2.29millionsqmi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the pale crag martin is {{not considered to be}} threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or {{in family}} groups. A pair may {{cooperate}} to hunt. Prey can be eaten while <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> flying {{or when it}} lands on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Fauna) Notice 2008(2) {{under the}} Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The {{population}} size of Carnaby's cockatoo fell by over 50% in 45 years, {{and up to}} a third of their traditional breeding grounds in the Wheatbelt have been abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> part of an annual census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Carnaby's and other black cockatoos. The 2016 Great Cocky Count counted 10,919 Carnaby's black cockatoos, indicating the population had declined by 50% on the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain since 2010, dropping by around 10% each year. The total population is estimated to consist of 40,000 individuals.|$|E

5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. <b>The</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E
5|$|Other species also migrate shorter {{distances}} {{away from}} the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> young. After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species' normal range. Some species, such as the auks, {{do not have a}} concerted migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches. Other species, such as some of the storm petrels, diving petrels and cormorants, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, <b>the</b> <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and rasping when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in feeding groups. Other calls that can <b>be</b> heard when <b>the</b> <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> at <b>the</b> nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet.
