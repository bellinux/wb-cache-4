5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity {{is the introduction}} of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also {{been identified as a}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a threat model for ad hoc networks. It indicates components {{that can be}} used to form an adversary model for sensor networks and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETS). It identifies threat categories, modes of use, and a variety of <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> the systems assets including: <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> communications, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> infrastructure services, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> individual nodes, and threats concerning the human element. Example envisaged applications of the threat model are given: <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> secure information flows, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> threshold and identity based cryptography, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> risk and trust management.

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of information, communication and entertainment technologies will transform {{the lives of}} citizens and ultimately transform society. This paper focuses on ethical issues associated with the likely convergence of virtual realities (VR) and social networks (SNs), hereafter VRSNs. We examine a scenario in which a significant segment of the world’s population has a presence in a VRSN. Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction, this scenario is plausible. However, it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> both privacy and autonomy. The <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> privacy can be broadly categorized as <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> informational privacy, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> physical privacy, and <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> associational privacy. Each of these threats is further subdivided. The <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> autonomy can be broadly categorized as <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> freedom, to knowledge and to authenticity. Again, these three threats are divided into subcategories. Having categorized the main threats posed by VRSNs, a number of recommendations are provided so that policy-makers, developers, and users can make the best possible use of VRSNs...|$|R

30|$|<b>Threats</b> <b>to</b> {{internal}} validity {{are those that}} affect the conclusions drawn from the study by offering explanations for the outcome beside the independent variables. Many well-known <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> {{internal validity}} {{do not apply to}} a non-experimental study, e.g., history, maturation, instrumentation change or interaction of treatment and construct. The data for our study came from non-reactive observation, which rules out <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> internal validity that arise from the study itself influencing the behaviours of the participants, e.g., testing, experimenter demand, hypothesis guessing or resentful demoralization. In our study, we included the whole population of Apache Incubator projects, eliminating <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> internal validity that arise from selection bias or regression to the mean.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible for developing and manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted {{of a number of}} fixed guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as the <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible for developing and manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports. These defences consisted of fixed anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as the <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Australia increased. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} after Burebista's death {{and between the}} rule of Domitian and Tiberius, Dacian {{activity}} was minimal. The Dacians were forced into a defensive state where their main activity was keeping the Romans out of Dacian territories. The regional factions that remained posed no substantial <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Roman empire and the Roman sources themselves stop mentioning plans of Roman invasion during this time. Dacian power, resurged during the reigns of Duras – who reigned 68–87 AD – and peaked {{during the reign of}} Decebalus – who reigned from 85/87-106 AD. By this time the Dacian tribes had united once more, under the ruler of Decebalus, and again posed a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Rome.|$|E

5|$|Lili posed a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Bermuda, and a {{hurricane}} warning {{as the storm}} approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also posed a significant <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did not predict a northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion in North Carolina and rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.|$|E
40|$|Don Campbell’s {{name will}} long be {{associated}} with the notion of threats tovalidity. In part, this is because he provided memorable and pedagogically appealing labels for, and categorizations of, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity (Campbell, 1957; Campbell & Stanley, 1966; Cook & Campbell, 1979). Equally consequential have been Campbell’s demonstrations of the pernicious nature and omnipres-ence of <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity (e. g., Campbell & Boruch, 1975; Campbell & Erlebacher, 1970) and his explication of an epistemology whereby the effects of a treatment are assessed by ruling out plausible rival hypotheses (Campbell, 1974, 1988). The genius of Campbell’s (1969) contribution is also manifest in his imaginative illustrations of methods for ruling out <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity. The present chapter, which I hope is faithful to the Campbellian tradition, provides a typology of strategies by which <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity can be ruled out. Researchers have long been ruling out <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity using a wide variety of methods. The typology I propose explicates the logic by which all these methods work. By understanding the logic behind their methods, researchers should be able <b>to</b> rule out <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> validity more effectively and, equally important, be better able to assess how effectively they have ruled them out...|$|R
