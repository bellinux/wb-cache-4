5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E

50|$|There {{are times}} {{for all people}} and genders, {{distinguished}} in the declarative modes of involvement perspective: the present, <b>the</b> immediate <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>past</b> and future. <b>The</b> immediate <b>past</b> {{is not so much}} of recent events, but events that the speaker considers to be important in the present. It is distinguished by <b>the</b> immediate <b>past</b> speaker who considers unimportant events in the present. That is, they are already forgotten or outdated events.|$|R
5000|$|Verbal {{inflection}} is {{rich with}} a large number of tenses. Tense is usually carried by a suffix that attaches to the verb. The tense suffix may signal recent <b>past,</b> intermediate <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> long-ago-but-remembered <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> distant <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> intermediate future, or the distant future. For example, the suffix -leg indicates that the verb describes an event that took place in <b>the</b> recent <b>past,</b> usually earlier <b>the</b> previous day as seen in the Washo sentence, [...] "dabóʔo lew búʔlegi” (the white man fed us’’).|$|R
