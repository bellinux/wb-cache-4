5|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diệm regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands. The protesters fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were fired at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} {{sometimes}} grown as ornamentals. Dead stems decay {{to leave a}} hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits. These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios. The Roman Catholic Penitentes of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> backs in Holy Week processions. The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially.|$|E
5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It {{has been known}} to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole. Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> head and neck is an adaptation. They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the {{aforementioned}} Onibaba legend of Saitama comes from a misreporting of how the shinshoku of Hikawa Shrine would cover and hide <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> faces with masks whenever they try to break their prohibition from catching and eating fish or birds.|$|E

25|$|The rescuers spent 17 hours {{searching through}} the rubble for their fellow seamen, many using <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands to dig {{through the rubble}}.

25|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diem regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across the bridge leading to the pagoda, a large crowd of pro-Buddhist laypeople and anti-government protesters tore it down with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands. The crowd then fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were aimed at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge at dawn by driving armored cars through the angry crowd. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế had left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded. Ten truckloads of bridge defenders were taken to jail and an estimated 500 people were arrested in the city. The total number of dead and disappearances was never confirmed, but estimates range up to several hundred.|$|E

50|$|A Procession of Flagellants (Procesión de disciplinantes, or Procesión de flagelantes) is an oil-on-panel {{painting}} {{produced by}} Francisco de Goya between 1812 and 1819. In the foreground is {{a procession of}} Roman Catholic men dressed in white, wearing pointed hats and whipping <b>their</b> <b>bared</b> backs in penitence. Their backs are bleeding and they pull over-life-size statues of Nuestra Señora dela Soledad, the Ecce Homo and the Crucifixion of Christ. Other devotees, who are kneeling and wearing black hoods, line the route. On the right a man is impaled and all are carrying banners, crosses and lamps.|$|R

25|$|For mustard gas, {{which could}} cause severe damage by simply making contact with skin, no {{effective}} countermeasure was found during the war. The kilt-wearing Scottish regiments were {{especially vulnerable to}} mustard gas injuries due to <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> legs. At Nieuwpoort in Flanders some Scottish battalions took to wearing women's tights beneath the kilt {{as a form of}} protection.|$|E
25|$|Decimation – a {{sentence}} carried out against an entire unit that had mutinied, deserted, or shown dereliction of duty. One {{out of every}} ten men, chosen by lots, would be beaten to death, usually by the other nine with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands, who {{would be forced to}} live outside the camp and in some instances obliged to renew the military oath, the sacramentum.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{beneficial}} to select the cover material carefully in order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes. In that case, finished compost {{could be used as}} cover material, although {{it is important that the}} users either do not touch this cover material with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands or that the composting process is sufficiently controlled such that no pathogens remain in the material.|$|E
5000|$|Mark Fell is a Rotherham-based music {{producer}} and artist. He has released several albums {{under his own}} name, with the duo SND he shares with Mat Steel, under the moniker Sensate Focus, and in various collaborations. He also maintains a sound art installation practice. Fell's work primarily explores the politics and ideologies of electronic dance music and experimental music culture, and is noted for its restrained and minimal style, which writer Dan Barrow described in The Wire as [...] "fragments of dance genres [...] [...] [...] torn from their contexts and stripped down to <b>their</b> <b>barest</b> logic, each component probed and rearranged until it makes provisional sense".|$|R

25|$|According to Singh, {{the dead}} Sikhs were {{stripped}} of their weapons, uniforms and equipment and <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> bodies {{laid out in a}} row at the nearby Buddhist Nagaraja Vihar temple. The corpses were burnt with a barrel of oil. The LTTE claimed to have tried {{to get in touch with}} the IPKF HQ at Palaly, but their efforts to get them collect the dead bodies were in vain. The bodies had started to decompose, and they had no option but to cremate them.|$|E
25|$|The entrenched Roman legions {{were then}} pitched {{in a battle}} against the Macedonian style phalanx troops in the centre with missile support {{in the form of}} stones and bolts coming from the rear. The phalanx, unable to put up a full charge, engaged the Roman legions. Despite this, the Romans still had to contend against pike phalanx units with their own short swords. In order for the troops to use their short-sword they had to swat away the {{opposing}} pikes with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands before drawing themselves near enough to attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 Clare won {{the very}} first Munster final before taking on Dublin in the All-Ireland final. The Clare men, who played in <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> feet, took a 1-5 to 1-0 lead at the {{interval}} in atrocious weather conditions. W.J. Spain scored three goals for the metropolitans in the second-half as Clare were held to a point. the 5-1 to 1-6 score line gave Dublin their first All-Ireland title and meant that goal-scoring hero Spain became the first dual All-Ireland winner as he won an All-Ireland football medal with Limerick in 1887.|$|E

25|$|Dionysus {{uses his}} divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him {{to spy on}} the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads, in the woods of Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual orgy, hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take {{him to be a}} {{mountain}} lion, and attack him with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Pentheus' aunts, and his mother, Agave, are among them; they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike, and takes the trophy to her father, Cadmus. The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} {{effectiveness}} of such an elite force, many Commandos are sent overseas to nations such as the US, UK and France to receive extra training in specialized areas that the Lebanese Armed Forces are unable to provide, {{due to a lack}} of resources. While training in Lebanon, each Commando is instructed in the art of urban and guerrilla warfare. So rigorous is their domestic training regime that each commando is subjected to a training timetable consisting of 20 hours per day for 3 months, which is divided into different stages. Each stage consists of a specialized form of warfare and its associated tactics. Such tactics include: sabotage, sniping, extraction and covert operations. The Lebanese Special Forces are also well known for killing and eating snakes with <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> hands at graduation ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|The college gown has the {{standard}} pattern of an undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge, with the sleeves sewn {{up for a}} length of eight inches from the shoulder. The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the Queen, an LL.D. on 21 October 1948. As academic dress, gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so {{that even in the}} summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses <b>their</b> <b>bare</b> shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth {{consented to}} treat, and {{hostilities}} ceased on terms {{that gave the}} O'Neill practically all his demands. The O'Neill offered some concessions, most significantly consenting to present himself before Elizabeth in London to argue his case against Sussex and the Baron of Dungannon in person. The O'Neill requested the hand of Sussex's half-sister Lady Frances Radclyffe in marriage as an earnest of future friendship. Accompanied by the Earls of Ormonde and Kildare as surety for his safety, the O'Neill reached London on 4 January 1562. William Camden describes the wonder which his gallowglasses occasioned in the English capital, with <b>their</b> heads <b>bare,</b> <b>their</b> long hair falling over their shoulders and clipped short in front above the eyes, and clothed in saffron-dyed shirts of fine linen.|$|R
60|$|From {{the windows}} the {{peasantry}} {{could now be}} seen, {{by the light of}} their torches, marching up the long avenue that fronted the Chateau, and headed by a single drum on which the bearer did no more than beat the step. They were a fierce, unkempt band, rudely armed--some with scythes, some with sickles, some with hedge-knives, and some with hangers; whilst here and there was one who carried a gun, and perhaps a bayonet as well. Nor were there men only in the rebellious ranks. There were an almost equal number of women in crimson caps, <b>their</b> bosoms <b>bare,</b> <b>their</b> heads dishevelled, their garments filthy and in rags--for the tooth of poverty had bitten deeply into them during the past months.|$|R
