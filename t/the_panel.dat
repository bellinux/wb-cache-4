In the report, <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. <b>The</b> <b>panel</b> also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E

50|$|The size of {{the throne}} and clear stylistic {{variations}} between <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> suggest that it involved the work of several 6th century Byzantine artists.

5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> facing right.|$|E

5|$|The {{attribution}} of <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art.

As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E

Firstly he will glue and wedge the rails to the meeting stiles and then join the two meeting stiles together with the folding wedges, the through top rail and the metal bar recessed into the bottom of the door. Then <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> are slid into their places from the outsides. Of course he will follow good practice when inserting <b>the</b> <b>panels,</b> he will ensure that there is no glue in the groove that will stick <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> to <b>the</b> groove thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> to move independently of the rails and stiles so they will not split as the door shrinks or expands. If the door is to be polished he will ensure that <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> are pre-polished with at least one coat to ensure that no bare wood is shown if <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> shrink. Once <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> are inserted <b>the</b> bench joiner will assemble the outer stiles, cramp and ensure the door is square before wedging up the mortise and tenons of the outer stiles.|$|R

5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. <b>The</b> <b>panel</b> had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to <b>the</b> <b>panel,</b> although <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> said that the records were not enough. <b>The</b> <b>panel</b> obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>panel</b> {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue.

The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E

40|$|The {{wind loads}} on solar energy systems are {{crucial for the}} {{engineering}} of <b>the</b> <b>panels,</b> substructure and fixings.

Combined {{with the increase in}} the size of photovoltaic (PV) <b>panels,</b> reducing <b>the</b> wind load is becoming more important. The wind loads on building integrated PV <b>panels</b> depend on <b>the</b> external pressures and the pressures in the cavity under <b>the</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of these pressures and the resulting wind loads on <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> are to a significant extent determined by the pressure equalization caused by the openings between <b>the</b> <b>panels.</b> An in-situ experiment has been carried out to assess the influence of the openings on the external and cavity pressures, {{as well as on the}} overall wind load...|$|R
