5000|$|Under Downs as host, 20/20 {{changed into}} a more {{standard}} yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around {{the world and into your}} home, <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> your life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E
40|$|In {{the shadow}} of conflagration, folklorists and other spinners of tales {{have a role in}} {{creating}} tolerance through stories, tales without borders that can be shared because they can be apprehended and appreciated whether or not the listener believes they are 2 ̆ 2 true. 2 ̆ 2 Religious fundamentalists of many faiths often take a dogmatic stance toward <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> on their religious beliefs. In so doing, they lose the ambiguities at the heart of story that enable tales to be shared across cultures and become a weapon for peace...|$|E

5000|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Todd VanDerWerff gave The Cold Lands a B- rating, stating, [...] "There are {{the bones}} of the stereotypical “loser has his life turned around by a kid” story here, but Gilroy takes all of this to a more realistic, more interesting place, and he manages to find an ending for <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> offers a <b>touch</b> of optimism but doesn’t feel like a cheat." ...|$|R

[...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a <b>story</b> for <b>the</b> screen:"Is it human, is it true to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself on these things, you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like <b>the</b> <b>story</b> or not.

[...] Indeed, Sullivan's scripts detailed locations, the number of actors, costumes, and even the blocking of the shoot. [...] Norman pointed to the following excerpt from the Hell's Hinges script {{as an example of the}} directorial detail contained in Sullivan's work:"SCENE L: Close-Up on Bar in Western SaloonA group of good western types of the earlier period are drinking at the bar and talking idly -- much good fellowship prevails and every man feels at ease with his neighbor -- one of them glances off the picture and the smile fades from his face to be replaced by the strained look of worry -- the others notice the change and follow his gaze -- their face reflect his own emotions -- be sure to get over a good contrast between the easy good nature that had prevailed and the unnatural, strained silence that follows -- as they look, cut."Once Sullivan's scripts were completed, Thomas Ince would stamp them [...] "Produce exactly as written," [...] leaving little to the discretion of the directors and cameramen. By setting every detail of the scene in words, Sullivan was able to [...] "control the outcome of the film he saw in his mind's eye." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for morally sustainable leadership, i. e., leadership with an awareness of both light and dark sides contained {{in the role of}} the leader, as symbolized by the archetype of the king. A narrative enquiry aiming at the study of fictive stories authored by management theorists and practitioners from different contexts, interweaving collective individual elements, brings to light how issues of leadership goodness are related to each other and to other themes. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> are presented as archetypical tales, <b>that</b> is, <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>touch</b> profound aspects of culture and the psyche. They reveal what happens when people are asked to imagine a good manager, and how this results in tragic ironic representations, rather than tales of straightforward goodness. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
