This will be carried out through the construction of a specialised Portal and a multilingual thesaurus for the social and educational dissemination of cultural, historic and natural heritage. We study cultural heritage and how it’s managed from a multidisciplinary point of view, employing the methods and procedures used in the human and social sciences, information technology and library science together with documentation.

Specification PEARL specifications and models represent prototypes of systems and programs, based on the PEARL program model. The system models built are checked for timely execution by co-simulation. <b>The</b> resulting <b>information</b> <b>shall</b> be used for fine-tuning the designs. Through the analysis of simulation traces a profiling process takes place. An integral CASE tool facilitating this holistic approach has also been devised. After the profiling process has produced a feasible system model, the program prototypes may be enhanced to their full functionality. As long as their timing properties are not changed by this, utilising this methodology should minimise the possibility of implementing an infeasible system.
