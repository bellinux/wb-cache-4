25|$|While the Ferraris {{pulled away}} (Alesi {{pulling away from}} Berger), Häkkinen passed Herbert (in the spare Lotus, an older car) who retired on lap 13 when his {{alternator}} failed. Alesi then pitted but his car refused <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> {{when he tried to}} rejoin resulting in his retirement. During Berger's stop, he was blocked by another car which was going into the pit. In his frustration, he accidentally stalled the car exiting his stop and lost over 10 seconds, dropping back to third. Coulthard also got ahead of Hill during the stops, however Hill passed Coulthard on lap 29 to take the lead.|$|E
50|$|The Sauber C30s of Kamui Kobayashi and seventh-placed Sergio Pérez retired with {{near-identical}} gearbox problems, {{reducing the}} field to just fifteen drivers plus Daniel Ricciardo. Ricciardo's car had gone into anti-stall on the grid before failing <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear.</b> The car was immediately returned to the pits while repairs were carried out, and although Ricciardo returned to the circuit, he was some eight laps behind the last-placed Timo Glock {{at the time of}} Pérez's retirement. Ricciardo would ultimately finish the race fourteen laps behind race winner Vettel, and was therefore not classified as a finisher as he had failed to complete 90% of the winner's race distance. With just fifteen drivers on the track, the Team Lotus drivers of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli were able to secure 13th and 14th place, further reinforcing the team's claim to tenth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|E
5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always engage the shaft, but gears on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. <b>To</b> <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully <b>engages</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> on the other shaft. If the gear shafts are spinning so the two gears have the same surface speed, the gears are relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> However, if speeds are mismatched, the gears tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|R
500|$|The {{mechanical}} clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower {{featured a}} great driving-wheel that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, {{into each of}} which water poured at a uniform rate from the [...] "constant-level tank" [...] (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in <b>a</b> pinion which <b>engaged</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> wheel {{at the lower end}} of the main vertical transmission shaft.|$|R
5000|$|When a UniTrol {{snowblower}} is running, {{the engine}} is always turning a drive platter. The act of <b>engaging</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> presses <b>a</b> rubber-edged wheel against the flat steel surface of the spinning platter, which transfers power through 90 degrees to the drive axle and at a ratio inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} center of the platter at which the wheel is <b>engaged.</b> <b>A</b> neutral [...] "gear" [...] is available by simply lifting the wheel from the surface of the platter, and <b>a</b> reverse <b>gear</b> is available by engaging the wheel at a symmetric point across the center of the platter.|$|R
40|$|In gearbox {{synchronizer}} design process, {{the most}} important parameter to be determined is the effort required <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> within specified time interval (or vice versa – engaging time for the specified effort). Usually, reduction of said effort implies {{one of the following}} approaches: choosing a friction cone as large as possible, or using a multi-cone design. However, according to practical experience and investigations of shifting process, engaging effort may not be the decisive factor in shifting quality assessment. One can observe that during shifting the force exertion process often has two stages. The first stage {{is a result of the}} synchronization process itself. The existing second stage, effort amount, and instability of force observed at this stage while repeating shifts, require a thorough investigation. Therefore, the subject of the work was the shifting process stages that affect the engaging effort. The paper gives the certain characteristics of shifting process to demonstrate that there is the second stage in force exertion. The paper describes a technique for calculating the force acting on synchronizing sleeve and presents results of such calculations for several types of synchronizers. These results showed that in the case when tooth rims of a synchronizing sleeve and a gearwheel situated against each other in an adverse way, simultaneous sleeve movement and gearwheel rotation exert the second peak of the force comparable with synchronization effort (≈ 53 … 71 %). The remainder of the paper shows the ways to decrease said second force peak. Recommendations for synchronizers design improvement are given as well. The conclusion has been made that technical requirements for modern synchronizer design, apart from the maximum synchronization effort, must provide relative maximum value of the second peak of at most 1 / 3 of synchronization effort. This will ensure improved perception of the shifting process. </p...|$|E
