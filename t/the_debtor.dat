5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English {{contract}} law and the law of real estate that governs the transfer of rights from one party to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt. In this situation the party who is assigned the debt can sue <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> despite any contractual agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E
5|$|Frances Trollope, her daughters, Emily and Cecilia, {{and two of}} her sons, Anthony and Tom, {{moved to}} Hadley Common from Bruges, Belgium, where they had fled to escape debtors' prison in England. When Trollope's husband (<b>the</b> <b>debtor)</b> died, the threat of prison receded. Emily had {{tuberculosis}} and her doctor advised that winter in England would benefit her.|$|E
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In the event that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, {{and returned to the}} creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

Therefore, where a writ against the movables of <b>the</b> judgment <b>debtor</b> is issued and served, and insufficient attachable movables are found, the writ must be re-issued against <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> immovable property.|$|R

5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
25|$|An arrest {{may only}} be ordered if the {{creditor}} can establish the prima facie validity of his claim {{as well as one}} of several statutory prerequisites for an arrest. An arrest may notably be imposed if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> holds a certificate of unpaid debts against <b>the</b> <b>debtor,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> attempts to hide or dispose of his assets, or if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is not resident in Switzerland. The arrest of the assets of foreign debtors also establishes a venue in Switzerland under Swiss private international law in which <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> may be sued by the creditor, except if the Lugano Convention is applicable.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{specific}} {{characteristics of the}} factoring agreement, its close link with the assignment of credit claims and their different functions, this paper seeks to approach their implications for <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> legal position.

50|$|In essence, an {{emoluments}} attachment {{order is}} a procedure whereby a debt may be collected from a judgment <b>debtor.</b> <b>The</b> order is served on <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> employer (<b>the</b> garnishee), who is instructed to make regular {{weekly or monthly}} deductions from <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> salary and to pay these deductions over to the judgment creditor.|$|R
25|$|Creditors {{who hold}} a {{certificate}} of unpaid debts against <b>the</b> <b>debtor,</b> or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties who have benefited from unfair preferences or fraudulent transfers by <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> prior to a seizure of assets or a bankruptcy. If the challenge succeeds, the third party must return the assets formerly belonging to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to the DBO or the BO, {{as the case may}} be, and <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> may also be liable for criminal prosecution for bankruptcy fraud.|$|E
25|$|An act of {{insolvency}} {{need not}} be committed vis-à-vis the sequestrating creditor. Section 9(1) gives any creditor of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> the right to apply for sequestration once <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> commits an act of insolvency—whether or not <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> directed the act at the creditor concerned or intended it to have any bearing on that creditor’s affairs.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{adjudication}} on the application, {{the applicant}} must furnish {{a copy of}} the application to <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> The court may, in its discretion, dispense with this requirement and make a provisional order of sequestration without advance notice to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> if it is satisfied that this would be in the interest of creditors or of <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Generally, a {{creditor}} who {{has obtained}} a monetary judgment (a ruling from a court under which another party {{is required to}} pay money to the creditor) may enforce this judgment through the seizure and forced sale of <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> property, through <b>the</b> seizure of money held in <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> bank accounts, and through garnishment of <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> wages. In each instance, however, the creditor is required {{to engage in a}} [...] "public act", such as the recording of a lien on the title to <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> real estate to be seized, or using other public notice to place a lien on debtor's personal property. Thus, the required public act fixes a lien on <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> property. Not only does this establish the rights of the creditor to seize and sell the property, it also determines what priority the creditor will have against other creditors who may wish to seize the same property.|$|R
25|$|As a {{safeguard}} against <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> dissipating {{his assets}} after publishing a notice of surrender, the Master may appoint a curator bonis to <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> estate. <b>The</b> idea {{here would be}} to prevent a suspicious debtor (suspicious, that is, to the Master) from dissipating his assets.|$|R
5000|$|In the past, <b>the</b> {{judgment}} <b>debtor</b> {{could have}} been committed to prison or have a receiving order made against him in a judgment summons under <b>the</b> <b>Debtors</b> Act 1869.|$|R
25|$|The term “sequestration” {{should be}} used only with {{reference}} to a person’s estate. It is the debtor’s estate that is sequestrated, not <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> himself. On the other by, both the debtor’s estate and <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> himself may properly be described as insolvent.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{creditor}} {{may have}} good reason for believing <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is insolvent, he will usually not {{be in a position}} to prove that the debtor’s liabilities exceed his assets. If, however, the creditor can establish that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> has committed one or more “act” of insolvency, he may seek an order sequestrating the debtor’s estate without having to prove that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is insolvent. Therefore, a debtor’s estate may be sequestrated even though he is technically solvent.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason is}} to reduce the ever-present risk of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> abusing the {{sequestration}} procedure and resorting to sequestration when it holds little or no real benefit for creditors and simply gives <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> a means of escaping his liabilities.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{priority}} and rank ordering feature of bankruptcy law, debtors sometimes improperly collude with others (who {{may be related}} to <b>the</b> <b>debtor)</b> to prefer them, by for example granting them a security interest in otherwised unpledged assets. For this reason, the bankruptcy trustee is permitted to reverse certain transactions of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> within period of time prior to the date of bankruptcy filing. The time period varies depending on the relationship of the parties to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> {{and the nature of the}} transaction.|$|E

25|$|Proof of {{inability}} to pay one debt may be accepted as proof that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is unable to pay all his debts, but evidence that <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> was unwilling or has refused to pay a particular debt {{is not enough to}} establish this act of insolvency.|$|E

25|$|Finally, the aitire is a surety {{who became}} a hostage {{in the case of}} a default. Once the hostage was in captivity, <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> had ten days to pay the debt to have the hostage {{released}}. If the hostage was not released by then, expenses to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> could become exorbitant. The aitire had to pay his own ransom by paying his body-price, which was expensive, and <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> had to pay twice that fee plus the surety's honour-price. The aitire could enforce the debt to him by himself.|$|E
25|$|Various court {{proceedings}} may be initiated {{at this stage}} between the creditors, <b>the</b> <b>debtor,</b> the bankruptcy administrator and third parties to determine {{the validity of the}} creditors' claims, their relative rank, and the assignment of disputed assets or liabilities to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> or to third parties. Once the schedule of claims (Kollokationsplan / état de collocation) as well as the assets and liabilities of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> are no longer contested, the second creditors' meeting may decide on the mode of liquidation of the bankrupt business; this may include a sale at auction or a direct sale of assets.|$|E
25|$|Within {{seven days}} of {{publication}} of the notice of surrender, <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> must furnish copies of the notice all to creditors whose addresses are known, and to other parties, including employees.
