[...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga {{has found a way to}} place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E

60|$|Gaelic-speaking Ireland, {{because its}} art has been made, {{not by the}} artist {{choosing}} his material from wherever he has a mind to, but by adding a little to something which it has taken generations to invent, {{has always had a}} popular literature. We cannot say how much that literature has done for the vigour of the race, for who can count the hands its praise of kings and high-hearted queens made hot upon the sword-hilt, or the amorous eyes it made lustful for strength and beauty? We remember indeed that when the farming people and the labourers of the towns made their last attempt to cast out England by force of arms they named themselves after the companions of Finn. Even when Gaelic has gone and the poetry with it, something of the habit of mind remains in ways of speech and thought and 'come-all-ye's' and poetical sayings; nor is it only among the poor that the old thought has been for strength or weakness. Surely these old stories, whether of Finn or Cuchulain, helped to sing the old Irish and the old Norman-Irish aristocracy to their end. They heard their hereditary poets and story-tellers, and they took to horse and died fighting against Elizabeth or against Cromwell; and when an English-speaking aristocracy had their place, it listened to no poetry indeed, but it felt about it in the popular mind an exacting and ancient tribunal, and began a play that had for spectators men and women that loved the high wasteful virtues. I do not think that their own mixed blood or the habit of their time need take all, or nearly all, credit or discredit for the impulse that made those gentlemen of the eighteenth century fight duels over pocket-handkerchiefs, and set out to play ball against the gates of Jerusalem for a wager, and scatter money before the public eye; and at last, after an epoch of such eloquence the world has hardly seen its like, lose their public spirit and their high heart, and grow querulous and selfish, as men do who have played life out not heartily but with noise and tumult. Had they known the people and the game a little better, they might have created an aristocracy in an age that has lost the understanding of the word. When one reads of the Fianna, or of Cuchulain, or of any of their like, one remembers that the fine life is always a part played finely before fine spectators. There also one notices the hot cup and the cold cup of intoxication; and when the fine spectators have ended, surely the fine players grow weary, and aristocratic life is ended. When O'Connell covered with a dark glove the hand that had killed a man in the duelling-field, he played his part; and when Alexander stayed his army marching to the conquest of the world that he might contemplate the beauty of a plane-tree, he played his part. When Osgar complained as he lay dying of the keening of the women and the old fighting-men, he too played his part; 'No man ever knew any heart in me,' he said, 'but a heart of twisted horn, and it covered with iron; but the howling of the dogs beside me,' he said, 'and the keening of the old fighting-men and the crying of the women one after another, <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are vexing me.' If we would create a great community--and what other game is so worth the labour?--we must re-create the old foundations of life, not as they existed in that splendid misunderstanding of the eighteenth century, but as they must always exist when the finest minds and Ned the beggar and Seaghan the fool think about the same thing, although they may not think the same thought about it.|$|E

40|$|Most Italians {{thought of}} themselves, and some still do, {{in terms of}} provincial identities. In America, they tended to settle in large Italian colonies, {{duplicating}} the customs and traditions of their particular Italian town or village (Mangione and Morreale 130). So {{it was not unusual}} for people from one particular town or village to be housed in one tenement or on one block. Family and their village of origin were very important.

In Louisa Ermelino’s The Sisters Mallone, <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>is</b> an extension of what bell hooks calls “homeplace” and has the same “subversive value” (47). The neighborhood expands the domestic space and underscores the tenuous line between public and private, masculine and feminine. In the novel, the Italian-American neighborhoods of New York’s lower East Side and Hell’s Kitchen serve as “sanctuary and trap” for men and women (Barone 20); however, <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>is</b> more sanctuary for women and trap for men. As Fred L. Gardaphé writes, Ermelino “explore[s] and explain[s] the places where power lies in Italian-American culture— with the mothers” (110). Her female characters incrementally propel the traditional power of the domestic space into the public arena, while the male characters become more and more bound by womanhood and the neighborhood. In The Sisters Mallone: Una Storia di Famiglia (2002), Ermelino maps the male and female interactions that occur inside the home and outside it. Both the homeplace and the neighborhood serve as sites of resistance to the social and cultural imperatives of American society that help the Mallones transform their own identities and those of their male counterparts...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{works that}} Warhol {{submitted}} to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.

Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like [...] "Um, no" [...] and [...] "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can <b>be</b> traced to <b>the</b> years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.|$|R
40|$|A common {{observation}} among psychologists, {{dating back}} at least to the 1920 s (cf. Issacs, 1930; Piaget, 1923; Vygotsky, 1978), is that children appear to talk in a more sophisticated way and to accomplish more complicated intellectual acts in the course of spontaneous interactions with their social and physical environments than they do when they are being interrogated by adults. There are, generally speaking, two lines of explanation for this observation. Arguing from somewhat different developmental perspectives, Piaget and Vygotsky both claimed that spontaneous problem-solving was, in general, easier than problem-solving at the instigation of adults, which requires that the child respond in terms of special rules that restrict her response options in various ways. Although she did not take up this topic in a formal fashion, Issacs interpreted performance differences associated with spon-taneous and elicited problem solving differently.

2500|$|But soon <b>the</b> team <b>is</b> {{betrayed by}} Shade, {{who had made}} a deal with the Overlords. Desiring a body with which to survive the Overlords' {{destruction}} (since <b>the</b> Thinker <b>is</b> also a product of the Change), he betrayed the children, bartering them and the knowledge of their Change talents in exchange for Overlord body technology (his Thinker is destroyed by an Overlord later). Gold-Eye and Ninde are taken prisoner. Ella and Drum, managing to escape, climb to the top of Mount Silverstone, meet a hologram of Shade, who though having been physically destroyed, <b>is</b> spread through <b>the</b> Overlords' computer systems. His original personality had been attempting to manifest itself, such as when Shade was speaking to Gold-Eye and Ninde about their fate {{at the hands of the}} Overlords, or when Shade was inwardly arguing with himself. [...] However, it only managed to when <b>the</b> Thinker <b>was</b> destroyed. [...] He guides them to the Grand Projector, when, about to disable it, they hear an Overlord approaching. Ella, desperate, destroys the Thinker which regulates the Grand Projector, causing it to overload. This has the positive effect of disabling all Overlord creatures and removing the Overlords, but exposes Ella and Drum to lethal amounts of Change radiation, killing them. The burst of Change radiation, while not lethal where Ninde and Gold-Eye are (they are being executed by an Overlord), enables them to respectively read the minds of thousands of newly freed children, and see a distant future, at which time he and Ninde <b>are</b> <b>the</b> parents of two children named for Ella and Drum. Ninde sends this [...] "soon to be now" [...] to Ella and Drum through her Change Talent, and <b>those</b> thoughts <b>are</b> <b>the</b> last <b>things</b> that they see.|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} question was: How can political coalitions be built across {{urban and rural}} divides {{in order to create}} equitable education policy at the state level? How can political coalitions be built across ethnic and racial lines in order to create equitable education policy at the state level? In many school districts resources are highly dependent on a child’s zip code. This is due to most school funding coming from local property taxes which result in greater per-pupil expenditures compared to poorer districts which often happen to include more nonwhite students. From here, my tentative answer how political coalitions are built across urban and rural divides as well as racial and ethnic divides is that they are created by leaders who capitalize on a unifying ideology that stems from common interest. My rationale for this answer comes from observing that coalitions are not created by chance; instead leaders forge them and larger coalitions involve different leaders bringing together their groups to create a larger movement. Thus my hypothesis is that interracial and urban-rural coalitions occur when common interests and common experience lead to a common ideology, which a leader can use to create an effective interracial and statewide coalition to try to pass equitable education policy at the state level. This means that leaders who draw upon a common ideology, which stems from common experience and common interests, make coalitions. I tested my hypothesis by analyzing how coalitions were made in 2007 and 2014 in Pennsylvania's Fair Funding for Equitable Education campaigns. My results were that not many of <b>the</b> same organizers <b>were</b> around for <b>the</b> 2007 coalition and I was unable to gather much evidence around this. It seems that <b>the</b> 2014 campaign <b>is</b> much broader and includes more groups than before but they are still not thinking about issues of race and geography, or even the power of a grassroots movement to help unite their coalition and help them convince the state Legislature. Unless the campaign wants to compromise their ideals by working with business again, they are going to need more people power as <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only two <b>things</b> legislatures care about...|$|R
