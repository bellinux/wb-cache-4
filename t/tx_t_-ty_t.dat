40|$|One {{of the key}} results we {{associate}} with the Pareto/NBDmodel (Schmittlein et al. 1987) is an expression for P (alive | x, <b>tx,</b> <b>T),</b> {{the probability that a}} customer with purchase history (x, <b>tx,</b> <b>T)</b> is “alive ” at time T. In Fader, Hardie and Lee (2005) we present the BG/NBD model {{as an alternative to the}} Pareto/NBD. The positioning of this work is that the model yields very similar results to the Pareto/NBD while being vastly easier to implement. Although we present analogous expressions for most of the quantities reported in Schmittlein et al. (1987), we do not report an expression for P (alive). This has led some to claim that this quantity cannot be computed using the BG/NBD model; as we shall see, this is not the case. (Our primary reason for not presenting this result is simply that we see the quantity as a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. However, continued interest in it leads us to write this note.) Deriving the expression for P (alive) under the BG/NBD model is a triv-ial exercise. Given the assumptions of the BG/NBD model, the probability that a customer with purchase history (x, <b>tx,</b> <b>T)</b> is alive at time T is simply the probability that he did not “die ” at tx. Recall the BG/NBD likelihood function: L(r, α, a, b |x, <b>tx,</b> <b>T)</b> = B(a, b+ x...|$|R

This method is sometimes referred to as Linear Spatial Filtering and the template is called a filter mask.|$|R

40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis is to study fixed point theorems for {{iterated}} contraction mappings in metric and generalized metric spaces. [...] In the beginning, {{we have discussed}} Banach’s Contraction Principle, "A contraction mapping of a complete metric space into itself has a unique fixed point”, together with its various generalizations in metric spaces. [...] Then the iterated contraction mapping, “d(Tx,TTx) ≤ kd(x,Tx), for all x, <b>Tx</b> E (X,d), <b>T</b> : X – X, and for some constant k, 0 ≤ k < 1 ", has been considered. We have given the iterated contraction mapping principle, "An iterated contraction mapping, which is continuous at the limit of its sequence of iterates, of a complete metric space into itself has a fixed point", by following the procedure of the Banach Contraction Principle. Then generalizations of the iterated contraction principle have been given in metric spaces. Iterated contractive mappings, "d(Tx,TTx) < d(x,Tx), for all x, Tx E (X,d), x = <b>Tx,</b> <b>T</b> : X – X” and iterated nonexpansive mappings, “d(Tx,TTx) ≤ d(x,Tx), for all x, <b>Tx</b> E (X,d), <b>T</b> : X – X”, have also been considered briefly in metric spaces.

First, the response of the system to a unit step function of surface temperature Ts(t) is obtained. The temperature distribution in the medium corresponding to arbitrary surface temperature Ts(t) is then expressed in terms of the response function and convolution integral. The analytical solution of the convolution integral is obtained for a periodic variation of Ts(t). The resulting expression for <b>T(x,</b> <b>t)</b> is identical with that obtained by the usual periodic analysis. Numerical computations are carried out to investigate the dependence of the accuracy of numerical results on the upper limit of time (to) in the convolution integral. ...|$|R

However, the orbit with the non-zero limit point may not be dense, and so the vector x inducing the orbit need not be hypercyclic.
