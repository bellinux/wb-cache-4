5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger {{in favour of}} Ray Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> by the FA.

5|$|He {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with York in October 2007, which would expire {{in the summer of}} 2009. He played in a more central position behind the strikers in 2007–08. He scored two goals in two minutes against Altrincham on 19 January 2008, which earned York a 2–2 draw, during which he played as a striker. Manager Colin Walker confirmed that several enquiries had been made about signing Woolford during the January transfer window. Woolford was set a 20-goal target by Walker in April 2008, at which point he had scored 16 goals. He was watched by Crewe Alexandra's director of football Dario Gradi in April 2008, after which Walker insisted he was still a part of York's plans for the next season. He finished 2007–08 with 57 appearances and 17 goals. He rejected speculation linking him with a move away from York in June, saying he would only move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> two divisions higher.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Arsenal {{suffered}} their heaviest league {{defeat in}} 84 years as they lost 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game {{by such a}} margin since 1927 when they lost 7–0 to West Ham United in the old Football League First Division. This {{was also the first}} time they had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when they lost 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough in the old Football League Second Division. A year later, striker Robin van Persie joined United, having stated that he would not renew his contract with Arsenal. It was speculated that he would move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> overseas, but signed for the Manchester club, the first Arsenal player to do so since Viv Anderson in 1987. Ferguson called Wenger to push through a deal when he learnt of the contract situation. Van Persie was instrumental in United's league win of 2012–13 – Ferguson's last, and coincidentally received a guard of honour by his former teammates before United faced Arsenal at the Emirates in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960–61 season, Greaves scored hat-tricks against Wolves, Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City; {{he scored}} four goals against Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest; and hit five {{goals in a}} 7–1 win over West Bromwich Albion. His hat-trick against Manchester City on 19 November {{included}} his 100th league goal, making him the youngest player to pass the 100-goal mark, {{at the age of}} 20 years and 290 days. However, he became increasingly disillusioned at Chelsea as, despite his goals, the team also conceded goals with regularity, and were never consistent enough to mount a title challenge. They also exited the FA Cup by losing 2–1 at home to Fourth Division side Crewe Alexandra. Club chairman Joe Mears agreed to sell Greaves as Chelsea were in need of extra cash. His last game was the final game of the 1960–61 season on 29 April; he was made captain for the day and scored all four goals in a 4–3 win against Nottingham Forest. This took his tally for the season <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> record 41 goals in 40 league games, making him the division's top scorer.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United later {{accepted}} a £1.5 million offer for Whiteside from A.C. Milan, and offered him £100,000 in cash {{to accept the}} transfer. He refused the move as he felt {{he still had a}} good future with Manchester United and because he was given only a brief time to consider whether or not to relocate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> and location he knew little about. He continued to impress, despite on-loan striker Garth Crooks being tipped to take his first team place and sign a permanent contract (which never happened). United were trophyless however in 1983–84, exiting both domestic cup competitions to Third Division sides. He did though play a part in the memorable 3–0 win over Barcelona at Old Trafford in the Third Round of the European Cup Winners' Cup. He lost his starting place to Mark Hughes for the semi-final clash with Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino, which ended in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry {{escalated}} in September 2003, when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. In {{the match}} Vieira was shown a second yellow card {{for his part}} in an altercation with striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, and during stoppage time, defender Martin Keown brought down Diego Forlán in the Arsenal penalty area. United were awarded a penalty and Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take it, but his shot rebounded off the crossbar. This was followed by scenes of jubilation from the Arsenal players, who confronted Van Nistelrooy after his miss and the resulting scuffle led to another fracas after the final whistle. The FA immediately took action, charging six of Arsenal's players (Jens Lehmann, Ray Parlour, Lauren, Cole, Keown and Vieira) with improper conduct. The club was fined £175,000, the largest ever given <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>club</b> by the FA at the time.

The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall.

Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees.

She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E
