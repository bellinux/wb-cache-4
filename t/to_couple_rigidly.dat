40|$|The {{basis for}} most vision based {{applications}} like robotics, self-driving cars and potentially augmented and virtual reality is a robust, continuous {{estimation of the}} position and orientation of a camera system w. r. t the observed environment (scene). In recent years many vision based systems that perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have been presented and released as open source. In this paper, we extend and improve upon a state-of-the-art SLAM to make it applicable <b>to</b> arbitrary, <b>rigidly</b> <b>coupled</b> multi-camera systems (MCS) using the MultiCol model. In addition, we include a performance evaluation on accurate ground truth and compare the robustness of the proposed method to a single camera version of the SLAM system.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of filament elasticity on the motion of collective molecular motors. It is found that for a backbone flexibility exceeding a characteristic value (motor stiffness divided through the mean displacement between attached motors), the ability of motors to produce force reduces as compared <b>to</b> <b>rigidly</b> <b>coupled</b> motors, while the maximum velocity remains unchanged. The force-velocity-relation in two different analytic approximations is calculated and compared with Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, we extend our model by introducing motors with a strain-dependent detachment rate. A remarkable crossover from the nearly hyperbolic shape of the Hill curve for stiff backbones to a linear force-velocity relation for very elastic backbones is found. With realistic model parameters we show that the backbone flexibility plays no role under physiological conditions in muscles, {{but it should be}} observable in certain in vitro assays.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} to calibrate {{a network of}} cameras by fusion of inertial-visual data. There {{is a set of}} still cameras (structure) and one (or more) mobile agent(s) camera in the network. Each camera within the network is assumed <b>to</b> be <b>rigidly</b> <b>coupled</b> with an Inertial Sensor (IS). By fusion of inertial and visual data, it becomes possible to consider a virtual camera beside of each camera within the network, using the concept of infinite homography. The mentioned virtual camera is downward-looking, its optical axis is parallel to the gravity and has a horizontal image plane. Taking advantage of the defined virtual cameras, the transformations between cameras are estimated by knowing just the heights of two arbitrary points with respect to one camera within the structure network. The proposed approach is notably fast and it requires a minimum human interaction. Another novelty of this method is its applicability for dynamic moving cameras (robots) in order to calibrate the cameras and consequently localizing the robots, as long as that the two marked points are visible by them. Index Terms—Sensor fusion, inertial data, Inertial Sensor (IS), camera network, infinite homography, calibration, mobile robot and virtual camera. I...|$|R

40|$|A Landau-theoretical {{approach}} is utilized {{to model the}} magnetic field induced reversal of the antiferromagnetic order parameter in thin films of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets. A key ingredient of this peculiar switching phenomenon {{is the presence of}} a robust spin polarized state at the surface of the antiferromagnetic films. Surface or boundary magnetization is symmetry allowed in magnetoelectric antiferromagnets and experimentally established for chromia thin films. It <b>couples</b> <b>rigidly</b> <b>to</b> the antiferromagnetic order parameter and its Zeeman energy creates a pathway to switch the antiferromagnet via magnetic field application. In the framework of a minimalist Landau free energy expansion, the temperature dependence of the switching field and the field dependence of the transition width are derived.

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are <b>rigidly</b> <b>coupled</b> in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ <b>to</b> a <b>rigidly</b> <b>coupled</b> state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|R

The algorithm does not impose constraints {{on the field of}} view of the cameras and works even in the extreme case when the sequences from the different cameras are totally disjoint (i. e. when no part of the scene is captured by more than one camera). The influence of the rig motion on the existence of a unique solution is investigated and degenerate rig motions are identified. Each camera captures an individual sequence which is afterwards processed by a structure and motion (SAM) algorithm resulting in positions and orientations for each camera.

40|$|Electron {{paramagnetic}} resonance (EPR) {{was used}} to optimize the solid-phase peptide synthesis of a membrane-bound peptide labeled with TOAC (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl-piperidine- 1 -oxyl- 4 -amino- 4 -carboxylic acid). The incorporation of this paramagnetic amino acid results in a nitroxide spin label <b>coupled</b> <b>rigidly</b> <b>to</b> the Α-carbon, providing direct detection of peptide backbone dynamics by EPR. We applied this approach to phospholamban, which regulates cardiac calcium transport. The synthesis of this amphipathic 52 -amino-acid membrane peptide including TOAC is a challenge, especially in the addition of TOAC and the next several amino acids. Therefore, EPR of synthetic intermediates, reconstituted into lipid bilayers, was used <b>to</b> ensure complete <b>coupling</b> and 9 -fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) deprotection. The attachment of Fmoc-TOAC-OH leads to strong immobilization of the spin label, whereas Fmoc deprotection dramatically mobilizes it, producing an EPR spectral peak that is completely resolved from that observed before deprotection. Similarly, coupling of the next amino acid (Ser) restores the spin label to strong immobilization, giving a peak that is completely resolved {{from that of the}} preceding step. For several subsequent steps, the effect of coupling and deprotection is similar but less dramatic. Thus, the sensitivity and resolution of EPR provides a quantitative monitor of completion at each of these critical steps in peptide synthesis. Mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and Edman degradation were used in concert with EPR to verify the chemistry and characterize the secondary structure. In conclusion, the application of conventional analytical methods in combination with EPR offers an improved approach to optimize the accurate synthesis of TOAC spin-labeled membrane peptides. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

5000|$|Slip joints {{in large}} {{structures}} {{are used to}} allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way. For example, if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian skyway at some high level, there are two options in structural engineering. If the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by earthquakes. In this case it may be appropriate to construct a rigid connection between the buildings, although this may require additional supporting members within the structures. On the other hand, a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not <b>coupled</b> <b>rigidly</b> but instead which is allowed to slide or [...] "float" [...] relative to one or both structures. This is especially suitable where the two structures may respond differently to ground motion. The structure will not be completely free to move but rather may use elastic materials to locate it {{near the center of}} its range of motion and viscous shock absorbers to absorb energy and to restrict the speed of relative motion. When a sliding connection is used it is extremely important that there be sufficient range of motion without failure to accommodate the maximum credible relative motion of the structures.
