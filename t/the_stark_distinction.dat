40|$|In {{the finance}} {{literature}} regulatory capital requirements have typically been considered the main factor influencing {{the choice of}} capital structure by banks. However, recent evidence (Gropp and Heider, 2007) suggests {{this may not be}} the case. In this study we investigate further whether the standard determinants of capital structure apply to banks. Whereas Gropp and Heider examine banks from the USA and Europe we examine banks from developing countries. Our preliminary results suggest that the standard determinants of capital structure do have power in explaining both book capital and market leverage. However, the direction of influence is not always as expected. Collectively, the buffer theory of excess capital seems to explain the level of excess book capital that banks hold while the excess market capital held by banks seems to be determined more by market pressures. While Gropp and Heider (2007) find no evidence to justify <b>the</b> <b>stark</b> <b>distinction</b> between book and market leverage for banks in developed countries, our results provides support to do so for banks in developing countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the transition to postmodernism, postfordism and participatory planning stresses {{the value of the}} economic and planning process shifts that have occurred in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. This paper compares two periods of planning and urban development in Toronto: one running from 1959 to 1962, at the height of modernism, fordism and expert-driven planning, and the other, from 1989 to 1992, set within the postmodern, postfordist and participatory planning era. In line with expectations arising from the literature, <b>the</b> study reveals <b>stark</b> <b>distinctions</b> between <b>the</b> two periods. It documents the breaking up of the modern consensus around the progress ideology into a postmodern constellation of values. As a result, the range of issues debated on the planning scene was much broader over the second period than over the first. Overall, however, results point to a mixture of continuity and change between the two periods and thus diverge from this literature's strong emphasis on transition. Contrary to expectations, citizen mobilization was pervasive in both periods, although there were major differences in the nature of activism and in the issues that were raised. Over the first period most activism originated from ratepayer organizations dedicated to the protection of single-family-home neighbourhoods from encroachments, whereas the second period featured, along with such associations, advocacy groups championing environmental and social causes. The two periods are also distinguished by different planning implementation capacities. Whereas in the first period, planning had the means to implement its visions, this was no longer the case in the second period. In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, planning was thus incapable of aligning urban development with its environmental and social ideals, which meant that, by default, planning practice over the second period proceeded pretty much according to land-use and transportation principles evolved in the early postwar decades. In sum, distinctions between the two periods were far more evident in the discourse than in the implementation sphere. Copyright Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{semantic}} theorising {{within the}} philosophy of language makes a <b>stark</b> <b>distinction</b> between minimalist and contextualist theories. Relevance Theory (RT) is usually classified as a radically contextualist theory because it takes the output of linguistic semantics to be non-propositional and endorses {{the view that the}} utterance of a particular sentence can express different propositions in different contexts. In this short note, I consider the essential components of radical contextualism and suggest that they do not, in fact, apply to RT and that the theory is more accurately construed as being radically pragmaticist...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> dynamical <b>Stark</b> shift on <b>the</b> quantum electrodynamics of an atom undergoing two-photon transitions, interacting with a quantized radiation field in an ideal cavity. To begin with, we discuss {{the dynamics of the}} electromagnetic field and the atom in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> shift. We derive closed expressions for the second-order coherence function, quadrature variances, atomic population inversion and dipole squeezing under the approximation of a large initial photon number and coherent or squeezed field input. We show that for an atom initially in the ground state, <b>the</b> inclusion of <b>Stark</b> shift reduces <b>the</b> field squeezing as well as the antibunching. Both the population inversion and the dipole squeezing exhibit phase sensitivity in <b>the</b> presence of <b>Stark</b> shift and for a particular choice of the relative phase of the two atomic levels "trapping" occurs in a two-level atom and the dipole is modified {{in such a way that}} it is permanently squeezed. We then discuss the effect of <b>the</b> <b>stark</b> shift on <b>the</b> emission spectrum of an atom and the cavity field spectrum. <b>The</b> inclusion of <b>Stark</b> shift results in asymmetric vacuum field Rabi splitting. We also study the dynamics of the combined atom-field wave function in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> shift and show that both the electromagnetic field and the atom periodically evolve to pure states which are radically different from those in the absence of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> shift. Finally, we study the nondegenerate two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model (NTPJCM) in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> shift and show that the dynamics of the NTPJCM in <b>the</b> presence of <b>Stark</b> shift is qualitatively different from the case of the absence of <b>the</b> <b>Stark</b> shift and radically different from the case of degenerate two-photon JCM in <b>the</b> presence of <b>Stark</b> shift...|$|R
