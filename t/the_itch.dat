5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and <b>the</b> <b>itch.</b>|$|E

During a second infection symptoms may begin in as little as 24 hours. These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline. The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children. <b>The</b> <b>itch</b> is often worse at night.

25|$|Some archaeologists {{believe that}} ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein they burned {{the bodies of}} their kings, in order to {{preserve}} only their ashes, and prevent them being mixed with those of wood or other combustible materials commonly used in funeral pyres. Others assert that the ancients used asbestos to make perpetual wicks for sepulchral or other lamps. A famous example is the golden lamp asbestos lychnis, which the sculptor Callimachus made for the Erechtheion. In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for this purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, ancient literature indicates that it was prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for <b>the</b> <b>itch.</b> It is possible that they used the term asbestos for soapstone, because the two terms have often been confused throughout history.|$|E

25|$|Referred <b>itch</b> is <b>the</b> {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as an itch or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The stimulus and referred <b>itch</b> are ipsilateral (<b>the</b> stimulus and <b>the</b> referred <b>itch</b> occur on <b>the</b> same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on <b>the</b> referred <b>itch</b> does not cause the stimulus area to <b>itch,</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the stimulus and <b>the</b> referred <b>itch</b> is unidirectional. <b>The</b> <b>itching</b> sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|R

Nasson says, [...] "for many enthusiastic English-speaking Union recruits, going to war was anticipated as an exciting adventure, egged on by <b>the</b> <b>itch</b> of making a manly mark upon a heroic cause." [...] Likewise the Indian element (led by Mahatma Gandhi), generally supported the war effort. Afrikaners were split, with some like Prime Minister Louis Botha and General Jan Smuts taking a prominent leadership role in the British war effort. Their pro-British position was rejected by many rural Afrikaners who favoured Germany and who launched the Maritz Rebellion, a small-scale open revolt against the government. The trade union movement was divided. Many urban blacks supported the war, expecting it would raise their status in society. Others said it was not relevant to the struggle for their rights. The Coloured element was generally supportive and many served in a Coloured Corps in East Africa and France, also hoping to better their lot after the war. Those blacks and Coloureds who supported the war were embittered when the postwar era saw no easing of white domination and restrictive conditions.|$|E
