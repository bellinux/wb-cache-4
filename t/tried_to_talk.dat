5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of it and they made a first successful landing {{on the east side of}} the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E

Gustafson, later claimed that he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the crowd into going home.|$|E

25|$|The Independent Socialist {{government}} of Harburg anticipated the Freikorps imminent arrival by arresting {{the commander of}} local Pionier-Bataillon 9 (Pioneer Battalion 9), leaving its 900 trained soldiers leaderless. On the morning of 15 March 1920, trade union leaders <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the pioneers into disarming the Freikorps, to no avail. Union workers were then armed to face the Freikorps. At mid day, parties of union men converged on the middle school.|$|E

25|$|Further, a {{majority}} of the Wittenberg Board of Directors had little heart to hear the heresy charges against Prof. Gotwald. In fact, the Wittenberg Board of Directors as well as the Miami Synod Convention passed up the chance to act on these heresy charges against Prof. Gotwald, brought by this minority of the Wittenberg Board of Directors. Some Wittenberg Theological Seminary faculty members even <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the accusers out of their intention to take action against Rev. Gotwald.|$|E

That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took Warsaw, Indiana police officer Judd Pittenger hostage. They marched him at gunpoint to the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests.

The two then traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{believed}} Dean and Angeli were deeply in love claim {{a number of}} forces led them apart. Angeli's mother disapproved of Dean's casual dress and what were, for her at least, radical behavior traits: his T-shirt attire, late dates, fast cars, {{and the fact that}} he was not a Catholic. Her mother said that such behavior was not acceptable in Italy. In addition, Warner Bros., where he worked, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> him out of marrying and he himself told Angeli that he didn't want to get married. Richard Davalos, Dean's East of Eden co-star, claimed that Dean wanted to marry Angeli and was willing to allow their children to be brought up Catholic.|$|E

25|$|Nevada State Prison {{had been}} the state-designated {{facility}} for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich {{did not want to}} be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad.|$|E
25|$|After {{a protest}} {{turned into a}} siege, Uthman refused to {{initiate}} any military action, {{in order to avoid}} civil war between Muslims, and preferred negotiations. After the negotiations, the protestors returned but found a man following them, holding an order to execute the protestors. The protestors returned and Uthman swore that he did not write the order. He refuted the claim and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it through. The protestors demanded he retire from being a caliph. Uthman refused and returned to his room. This emboldened the protestors and they broke into Uthman's house and killed him while he was reading the Qur'an. It was later discovered that it was not his autograph, but a forgery under his cousin Mu'awiya's autograph.|$|E
25|$|In early 1919, {{following}} the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Pittoni protested as the Arditi and the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento {{took over in}} Trieste. The city was soon placed under the governorship of Carlo Petitti di Roreto, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> Pittoni into accepting the national unification and the Trieste Social Democratic League's integration with the PSI. Pittoni was also opposed to the PSI's revolutionary socialism, and, in April 1919, stood in the minority of Trieste socialists who voted against joining the PSI and the Comintern; he also defended Adler, Camille Huysmans, and the ISC against Bolshevik criticism. By mid 1919 many of Pittoni's followers, Callini included, had deserted to the irredentist camp. Pittoni himself radicalised his opposition to Italian integration, and from 1920 argued that Trieste should form a state within the new Republic of Austria.|$|E

25|$|As {{news of his}} {{fighting}} exploits with Dublin's feuding gangs spread swiftly. He {{gained a}} reputation for keeping local criminals in check. One boxer, recognized as champion of the city, became jealous of Donnelly's reputation and took to following him around the local taverns demanding a fight. Eventually, Donnelly relented and the fight was staged {{on the banks of}} the Grand Canal. The event aroused a great deal of interest in Dublin, and a good crowd turned up. Right up to the time they took sparring positions, Donnelly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> his rival out of fighting, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. As the fight dragged on, Donnelly gradually overcame his rival, and in a furious attack in the 16th round, beat him to the ground. Donnelly was declared the new champion of the city.|$|E
25|$|Following this, though Winters <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{them out}} of it, {{a number of the}} company's non-commissioned {{officers}} (NCOs) gave the regimental commander, Colonel Sink, an ultimatum: either Sobel be replaced, or they would surrender their stripes. Sink was not impressed and several of the NCOs were subsequently demoted and/or transferred out of the company. Nevertheless, Sink realized that {{something had to be done}} and decided to transfer Sobel out of Easy Company, giving him command of a new parachute training school at Chilton-Foliat. Winters' court martial was set aside and he returned to Easy Company as leader of 1st Platoon. Winters later said he felt that at least part of Easy Company's success had been due to Sobel's strenuous training and high expectations. In February 1944, First Lieutenant Thomas Meehan was given command of Easy Company.|$|E
25|$|On July 13 at Victory Road, Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> sense into Joe, as he {{was brutally}} beating Booker T, and was {{potentially}} heading towards a disqualification. Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat. Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as Impact! went off the air, leading {{to a question of}} whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation needed to learn about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as Jeff Jarrett who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.|$|E
