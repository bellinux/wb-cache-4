Tongue spots were thought to allow age discrimination after moult. Based on data from a study population in the Netherlands, where the age of many birds was known, we show that tongue spots are not useful for ageing Skylarks. Some nestlings lack tongue spots and half of all birds had tongue spots when three years or older. Regarding sex discrimination, males and females can usually be distinguished from a bimodal wing length distribution, but the <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> of overlap in wing length between sexes vary greatly between studies. Here, we show that 98 % of all individuals from our Dutch breeding population could be sexed correctly by wing length. However, during migration and winter, when populations from other regions co-occur in the same area, molecular analyses revealed that the overlap in wing length between sexes increased. Therefore, ringers need to be cautious when assigning sex, and small males especially are often misclassified.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} local housing market dynamics by applying an urban spatial model of gentrification based on Smith’s rent gap theory [Smith, N. (1979). Toward a theory of gentrification: a back to the city movement by capital, not people. APA Journal, 538 – 548]. Smith’s supply side approach explains the emergence of gentrifying neighbourhoods on the basis of investments spent in “large scale renewal projects” which only investors or developers looking for profits are able to carry out. They invest in degraded areas on the base of the gap between the actual rent and the potential rent after rehabilitation (rent gap). Afterwards the process is sustained by an imitative cooperative behaviour of property owners having advantage in investing in their properties since the quality of the nearby buildings, and their rents, arises. In Smith’s thesis home owners, landlords and developers are the leading actors coming into play of gentrification; they behave according to the search of profit or to the enhancement of their property rents, but their decisions to invest or not are conditioned by the quality of the neighbourhood. Space is a founding element in Smith’s approach to gentrification. In this paper, multi-agent systems and cellular automata have been envisaged as offering the most suitable modelling approach to the rent gap theory. A set of behavioural rules for each agent involved (homeowner, landlord, tenant and developer, and the passive agent “property unit”) has been formalized in the model and implemented on a NetLogo platform. A wide range of urban system simulations have been carried on with different parameter values concerning size of the neighbourhood, rent gap <b>threshold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>amount</b> of capital invested.

This parametrization is possible to cause excess shrinkage, thus, estimation bias at a sparse representation; i. e. there is a dilemma between sparsity and prediction accuracy.

Federal and state agencies currently issue warnings {{of the potential for}} shallow, rapidly moving landslides and debris flows in a few areas along the Pacific coast and for areas affected by Atlantic hurricanes. However, these agencies generally lack resources needed to provide continuous support or to expand services to other areas. Precipitation thresholds that form the basis of landslide warning systems now exist for a few areas of the USA, but the <b>threshold</b> rainfall <b>amounts</b> <b>and</b> durations vary over three orders of magnitude nationwide and over an order of magnitude across small geographic areas such as a county. Antecedent moisture conditions also have a significant effect, particularly in areas that have distinct wet and dry seasons. Early warnings of shallow landslides that include specific information about affected areas, probability of landslide occurrence, and expected timing are technically feasible as illustrated by a case study from the Seattle, WA area. The four-level warning scheme (Null, Outlook, Watch, Warning) defined for Seattle is based on observed or predicted exceedance of a cumulative precipitation <b>threshold</b> <b>and</b> a rainfall intensity–duration threshold combined with real-time monitoring of soil moisture.

The threshold in question was set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.

Here, we dub this type <b>threshold</b> an <b>AND</b> <b>threshold,</b> <b>and</b> we investigate the optimality {{of a variety of}} different <b>AND</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In addition, we define here a PRODUCT threshold where the product of the outage size and the duration is a constant. The investigation is empirical, using over 19, 000 network outage events above and below the FCC reporting threshold. We wish to search for an optimal threshold, which minimizes the number of reports, <b>and</b> maximizes the <b>amount</b> of communication loss exposed by the reports. As a consequence we define here a threshold figure of merit, which is the ratio of the communications loss and the number outages exposed relative to the FCC <b>threshold,</b> <b>and</b> seek to maximize this metric.

40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} {{reproductive}} traits and behavioral strategies displayed by an organism should vary strategically {{with respect to}} the intrinsic and extrinsic conditions it is exposed to. Condition-dependent strategies may allow an individual to enhance its reproductive success, a crucial component of Darwinian fitness. Such strategies are predicted to vary with mate availability and the time of mate encounter, which may determine Darwinian fitness, especially in species where reproduction is restricted to annually defined seasons. Moreover, an individual’s intrinsic conditions (e. g., its reproductive stage) at the time of encounter, may determine its mating propensity. It may thus be beneficial to adjust mating decisions, including mate acceptance <b>thresholds</b> <b>and</b> the <b>amount</b> of resources invested into an accepted mate, in response to when mates are encountered. Studies that determine how the timing of mate encounter affects individual mating decisions are currently scarce. In this thesis we experimentally investigate whether and how mating decisions are affected by the time of mate encounter, and determine the consequences of potential strategies on reproductive success, using the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, as a model species. Effects of the time of mate encounter on mating propensity, the degree of mate choice expressed, investment during mating, and the production of multiple seasonal broods are demonstrated. The results point to strategic, time dependent, mating decisions, which can importantly affect an individual’s reproductive success. Moreover, they provide evidence that the detected mating decisions may mitigate predicted negative effects of reduced mate encounter on reproduction and, ultimately, on population viability. The findings demonstrate that time dependent strategies may allow individuals to increase reproductive success and they might be more important in low-density populations. Processes such as habitat fragmentation and climate change affect population density, and thus can have negative effects on reproductive success and population viability. Moreover, temporal variation in mate availability exists {{in a wide range of}} species. Therefore, the results presented in this thesis may contribute to improving predictions of how species may respond to changes in population demography and climate change, and could provide crucial insight for conservation efforts.
