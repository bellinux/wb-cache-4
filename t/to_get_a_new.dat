However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E

Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was driving along with her mother, Sylvia, through London <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to turn left {{to get to the}} security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to turn right this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E

25|$|To further {{emphasize}} the durability and prove {{the reliability of}} the new Rebels, an absolute record of 30 hours flat was set in the long-distance Baja run down Mexico's Baja California Peninsula in 1967.

25|$|Some foreign {{visitors}} sometimes engage {{in what is}} known as a visa run: leaving a country—usually to a neighboring country—for a short period just before the permitted length of stay expires, then return to the first country <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> entry stamp in order to extend their stay ("reset the clock"). Despite the name, a visa run is usually done with a passport {{that can be used for}} an entry without a visa.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Nick {{liked the}} new sounds he was hearing, ranging from The Ramones in New York to The Damned in the UK. These visceral times Nick has often {{described}} as 'the best time of my life'. He was very inspired <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> band together, and in Spring – Early Summer 1977, he began putting The Machines together. He met Bass Player Duf (Ian Duffy) via an advert in the local paper, and Drummer John Dee (née Dearlove) down the pub.|$|E
25|$|To {{alleviate}} this, we {{can define}} operations for chaining these computations together. The bind binary operator (>>=) chains {{the results of}} one computation that could fail, into a function that chooses another computation that could fail. If the first argument is Nothing, the second argument (the function) is ignored and the entire operation simply fails. If the first argument is Just x, we pass x to the function <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Maybe value, {{which may or may}} not result in a Just value.|$|E

25|$|The city of San Francisco {{received}} a new incentive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> stadium built. Mayor Gavin Newsom {{wanted to bring}} the 2016 Summer Olympics to the city, and a new stadium would sweeten the city's proposal for selection by the United States Olympic Committee as the official US submission to the IOC. The announcement came in November 2006. It called for a new stadium that would be converted into a 68,600-seat stadium for the 49ers after the Olympics. The Olympic Village would be converted into low-income housing after the games were over.|$|E
25|$|Since Hurum {{could no}} longer be used, the {{government}} again recommended Gardermoen as the location. The Conservative Party instead wanted to build at Hobøl, but chose to support the Labour Party government's proposal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> airport as quickly as possible. Parliament passed legislation to build the new main airport at Gardermoen on 8 August 1992. At the same time, it was decided that a high-speed railway was to be built to Gardermoen, so the airport would have a 50% public transport market share.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 2006 Lee Dunne's novel Paddy Maguire is Dead, a semi-autobiographical {{novel about}} a writer's descent into alcoholism, was {{released}} in Ireland after being banned for thirty-four years. The book was originally published in the United Kingdom in 1972, but was banned in Ireland on its release because it {{was thought to be}} indecent and obscene. The next six of his novels were also banned, making Dunne the most banned author in Ireland. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> book published in Ireland until the late 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The passive {{resistance}} movement, with Clifford as {{its chief}} leader, {{had a large}} share in {{the defeat of the}} Unionist government in January 1906, and his efforts were then directed <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> act passed which should be nondenominational in character. The rejection of Augustine Birrell' bill in 1906 by the House of Lords was accordingly accompanied by denunciations of that body from Clifford and his followers. However, year by year went by, with nothing but failure {{on the part of the}} Liberal ministry to arrive at any solution of the education problem.|$|R

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} this {{situation}} might stem from a system that burdens the poor and black in Ferguson. Minor traffic offenses are the starting point, and the costs spiral up rapidly if the offenders do not pay the fines on time or do not appear in court. The income from court fines represented the second largest source of revenue for Ferguson in 2013. On October 1, 2014, the city of St. Louis cancelled 220,000 arrest warrants and gave a three-month delay to the offenders <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> court date before the warrants would be reissued.|$|E
25|$|Sephy decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{start and}} persuades a {{reluctant}} Jasmine {{to let her}} attend a boarding school, Chivers. Sephy has not heard from Callum for a week so she writes him a letter asking him to run away with her and telling him {{that she will be}} leaving for Chivers if he does not contact her. However, Callum has decided to join the LM, against the wishes of his mother, and he does not read the letter until just before Sephy leaves. Callum sprints to Sephy's house and fails {{to catch up with the}} car as it pulls out of the driveway. Having not seen Callum running behind, Sephy concludes that their friendship is no longer as important to him as she had thought.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{launched}} straight away. After their 11-hour journey across Exmoor, {{they now}} had to row for an hour into the storm to reach the Forrest Hall which was anchored close to Hurlstone Point. The lifeboat stood by – the crew rowing continuously to hold a safe position – until daylight when two tugs arrived and managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> rope across. Some of the lifeboatmen went on board to help raise the anchors as the crew were too tired to do it themselves. The tugs took it across the channel to Barry, accompanied by the Louisa and the Lynmouth lifeboat volunteers in case there were further problems. They finally arrived in port at about 05:00 on 14 January. The lifeboat crew were towed back to Lynmouth by a steam ship.|$|E

25|$|Previously {{the nearest}} {{operating}} station was Langley Mill. Following a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced that Ilkeston {{was one of}} three sites 'most likely' <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing £5 million and sited close to the old Ilkeston Junction station. On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station will be built, which will be named Ilkeston station. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters.

At the time this meant that 22 cities and 44 villages were set <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> name. Until 21 November 2015 municipal governments had the authority to implement this; if they failed to do so, the provincial authorities had until 21 May 2016 to change the names. If after that date the settlement had retained its old name the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine will wield authority to assign a new name to the settlement. In 2016 51,493 streets and 987 cities and villages were renamed and 1,320 Lenin monuments and 1,069 monuments to other communist figures removed.|$|E
