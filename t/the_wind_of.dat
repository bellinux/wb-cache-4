5|$|Amid decolonisation and <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change, the Federation {{failed to}} become a Commonwealth realm and {{collapsed}} in 1963. Two years later, following prolonged dispute with Britain over the terms for full sovereignty, the mostly white government in Southern Rhodesia (or Rhodesia, following Northern Rhodesia's independence as Zambia) issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). The Rhodesian government, counting several World War II veterans including the Prime Minister Ian Smith, attempted to emphasise Rhodesians' prior war record on Britain's behalf by declaring independence on Armistice Day, 11 November, at 11:00 local time. As part of its subsequent isolation of Rhodesia, the UK government banned the post-UDI authorities from {{taking part in the}} annual Armistice Day service at the Cenotaph in London. Smith's government organised its own Rhodesian wreath-laying ceremony there. Veterans of World War II and Malaya held many key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Sir John Edmond Hugh Boustead, KBE, CMG, DSO, MC & Bar (14 April 1895 – 3 April 1980), was a British {{military}} officer, modern pentathlete, and {{diplomat who}} served in numerous posts across several Middle Eastern countries, including ambassador to Abu Dhabi from 1961 to 1965. The son of a tea planter from Sri Lanka, Boustead began {{his career with the}} Royal Navy, but soon joined the British Army to fight in the trenches during World War I, where he earned his first of two Military Crosses. Following an appearance at the 1920 Summer Olympics, Boustead spent several years as a mountaineer and explorer prior to being appointed commander of the Sudan Camel Corps, with whom he served through World War II. He then embarked on a diplomatic career until his 1965 retirement and published an autobiography, <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Morning, in 1971, nine years prior to his death in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|The British government's {{refusal to}} grant {{independence}} to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely {{the result of}} the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the status quo became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.|$|E

The French developed the FB.53 model, a Nene-powered variant, which was named in French service as the Mistral after <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> the same name.

25|$|Even {{before the}} {{apartheid}} laws were passed in South Africa after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt {{it necessary to}} exclude non-white players. In 1906, the South Africans objected to the selection of black England international James Peters when he turned out for Devon; but were persuaded to play by officials. Though, when England faced South Africa later in the tour, Peters was not selected. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nepia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change speech and the Sharpeville massacre.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian government, which mostly {{comprised}} {{members of}} the country's white minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid decolonisation and <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change, less developed African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of [...] "no independence before majority rule" [...] ("NIBMAR"). Most white Rhodesians {{felt that they were}} due independence following four decades' self-government, and that Britain was betraying them by withholding it. This combined with the colonial government's acute reluctance to hand over power to black nationalists—the manifestation of racial tensions, Cold War anti-communism and the fear that a dystopian Congo-style situation might result—to create the impression that if Britain did not grant independence, Rhodesia might be justified in taking it unilaterally.|$|E

500|$|Salisbury's blunt {{refusal to}} be part of <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's {{traditional}} British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain's removal of Southern Rhodesia's conference seat with [...] "kicking us out of the Commonwealth", while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as [...] "this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth".|$|E
500|$|Amid decolonisation and <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>of</b> Change, {{the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] ("NIBMAR") gained considerable ground in British political circles during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Federation, which had faced black opposition from the start, particularly in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, grew ever more tenuous. Despite Todd's lowering of Southern Rhodesia's educational and financial voting qualifications in 1957 to enlarge the black electorate, {{very few of the}} newly enfranchised blacks registered to vote, partly because the black nationalist movement targeted those who did with arson attacks and petrol bombings. Attempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, Sir Edgar Whitehead, who replaced Todd in 1958, agreed a new constitution with Britain in 1961. The 1961 constitution contained no explicit independence guarantees, but Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents nevertheless presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the [...] "independence constitution" [...] under which Southern Rhodesia would become a Commonwealth realm on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation broke up.|$|E
500|$|The Colonești manor and its art fund {{fell victim}} to neglect. According to T. Vianu, the {{collection}} was [...] "blown over by <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> devastation" [...] even during the interwar years. In 1924, in defiance of its owner's final request, it was subject to a hasty public auction. This drew protests from literary figures such as Cezar Petrescu, Perpessicius and Victor Eftimiu. As {{a result of the}} auction, many works passed into the collections of Zambaccian, Alexandru G. Florescu, Iosif Dona and several others. Of them, Zambaccian attributed the incident to the National Liberal government's unwillingness to accept donations from [...] "a compromised person". He and several other commentators place responsibility for the sales on Finance Minister Ion Lapedatu, who is believed to have either hesitated in assessing the collection or to have plotted with businessmen who wanted it sold cheaply. Zambaccian was to be the eventual owner of Lăutul. It became a feature of his own Bucharest museum, and appears with Zambaccian in an oil portrait by Pallady.|$|E
40|$|Vortex, <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> a {{vector field}} in two dimensions, has its core the field {{singularity}} and its topological charge defined by <b>the</b> quantized <b>winding</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector field. Vortices {{are one of}} the most fundamental topological excitations in nature, widely known in hair whorls as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> hair strings, in fluid dynamics as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> velocities, in angular-momentum beams as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> phase angle and in superconductors and superfluids as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> order parameters. Nevertheless, vortices have hardly been observed other than those in the real space. Although band degeneracies, such as Dirac cones, can be viewed as momentum-space vortices in their mathematical structures, there lacks a well-defined physical observable whose winding number is an arbitrary signed integer. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space vortices as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> far-field polarization vectors in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of periodic plasmonic structures. Using a home-made polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we completely map out the dispersion, lifetime and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths. The momentum space vortices were experimentally identified by their <b>winding</b> patterns in <b>the</b> polarization-resolved iso-frequency contours and their diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices can exist robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not captured by the existing topological band theory developed for scaler fields. This work opens up a promising avenue for exploring topological photonics in the momentum space, studying bound states in continuum (BICs), as well as for rendering and steering vector beams and designing high-Q plasmonic resonances.
