5|$|During the 1960s, a third-place {{playoff game}} was played in Miami, called the Playoff Bowl. It was contested in early January {{following}} the 1960–69 seasons. Though official playoff games at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> played, the NFL now officially classifies these ten games (and statistics) as exhibitions, not as playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Khaba's name {{appears on}} nine {{polished}} stone bowls, variously made of magnesite, travertine, and diorite, which {{were found at}} the archaeological locales of Zawyet el'Aryan, Abusir, and Naga-ed-Deir. The bowls were found mostly intact; they show only the king's serekh name on their polished surfaces. As was conventional at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> made, they contain no additional inscriptions for context.|$|E
50|$|Many {{substrates}} {{provide a}} better bonding surface when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> treated at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> produced. This is called “pre-treatment.” The effects of corona treatment diminish over time. Therefore many surfaces will require a second “bump” treatment at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.|$|R

5000|$|According to {{official}} government estimates in Bangladesh 65% of girls are married off before their 18th birthday. 60 percent of child brides have children by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> 19 and 10 {{percent of them}} have children by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> 15. Bangladesh’s Penal Code places the age of consent at 14, through sex before marriage is frowned upon socially.|$|R
5|$|The {{work was}} {{undertaken}} rapidly, and 24 sites were completed and garrisoned {{by the end}} of 1540, with almost all of the rest finished {{by the end of}} 1543. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> completed, however, the alliance between Charles and Francis had collapsed and the threat of imminent invasion was over.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> first {{brought from the}} New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not available to buy in England. He would wear the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E

5|$|Line A {{is renowned}} for having kept its {{original}} 1913 rolling stock {{running on the}} line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service {{in the world at}} <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.|$|E
5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> penned by the author.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with the}} Indians. At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it {{was not going to be}} shaken for years to come.|$|E

5|$|The club {{made their}} first {{and so far}} only visit to Wembley Stadium on 9 May 1998, by winning through to {{the final of the}} FA Vase, under the {{management}} of Peter Quigley and his assistant Tony Heslop. They reached the final, beating Taunton Town 5–4 on aggregate in a two legged semi-final. In reaching the final, Tow Law, with its population of only 2,200, became the smallest town to ever reach a Wembley final. The team took around 4,000 supporters with them down to London, about twice the population of Tow Law at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> beaten in the final 1–0 by Tiverton Town.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{suffered a}} big setback in the 1987 legislative election. The UCR lost {{the majority in}} the chamber of deputies. All provinces elected Peronist governors, with the exception of Córdoba and Río Negro. Along with the city of Buenos Aires (a federal district at <b>the</b> <b>time),</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the only districts where the UCR prevailed. As a result, the government could not move forward with its legislative agenda, and the PJ only supported minor projects. The PJ was strengthened for the 1989 presidential elections, and the UCR sought to propose governor Eduardo Angeloz as candidate. Angeloz was a rival of Alfonsín within the party.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{resulted}} {{in hundreds of}} alleged victims of Savile and other abusers approaching {{the police and the}} NSPCC. Their claims were investigated and formed the basis of the report, which found that Savile's alleged offences were committed across England and Scotland, in hospitals, prison facilities, schools and BBC premises. Offences were reported between 1955 and 2009, totalling 214 alleged offences across 28 police forces. The most frequent alleged offending coincided with Savile's peak celebrity status. Numbers of alleged victims totalled 450, of whom 328 were minors at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> aged between 8 and 47 years, majority being 1316.|$|E

5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was {{not supported by the}} British Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> complete.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{ready for}} their first {{practical}} installation, they heard {{that one of their}} members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
