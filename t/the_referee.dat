5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in {{the sixth}} {{encounter}} of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> forced Tomko {{to head to the}} backstage area due to <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into <b>the</b> <b>referee,</b> knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles.|$|E

5|$|Leicester City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay {{to overcome their}} Third Division opponents 2–1. The first Leicester goal was controversial, as <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> overruled his linesman, who had flagged for a foul. Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but Leicester quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second half}} Leicester claimed a third goal, but <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and blow it back into her and the referee's eyes. With <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match was}} next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the {{advantage}} {{by focusing on}} injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post {{with a piece of}} tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the Jackknife power bomb on Hart. Before <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the Sharpshooter submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> could not control the match, it was declared a draw and Diesel retained his championship.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a {{standard}} match that featured Triple H and The Rock. Continuing the storyline of The Rock's injured arm, Triple H was scripted to target and attack The Rock's arm. Towards {{the final moments}} of the bout, Triple H asked Chyna, his valet, to retrieve a folding chair. <b>The</b> <b>referee,</b> however, took it away from him, which led to an argument between Triple H and the referee; the mishap prompted Triple H to push <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> down. <b>The</b> <b>referee</b> disqualified Triple H for this action; thus, The Rock won the match. After the match, Mankind ran in to save The Rock from Triple H and Chyna.|$|E
5|$|The first bout {{was between}} Samoa Joe and Jushin Liger. It lasted 7 minutes and 27 seconds. Joe was {{accompanied}} by two Polynesian dancers during his entrance, who performed for the crowd. Liger gained a near-fall on Joe at 6 minutes. Afterwards, Joe slammed Liger in the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. He then followed by applying his Coquina Clutch submission hold. As <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> waited for Liger to submit, he became limp, causing <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> to lift and drop Liger's arm three times, resulting in the knock-out victory for Joe.|$|E
25|$|During this process, {{the role}} of <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> is advisory. <b>The</b> {{publisher}} is typically {{under no obligation to}} accept the opinions of <b>the</b> <b>referees,</b> though she will most often do so. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the publisher can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that <b>the</b> <b>referees</b> achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the publisher based on her best judgement of the arguments. The group dynamics are thus substantially different from that of a jury.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in {{a standard}} match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> down. He attempted {{to take advantage of}} the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match pitted Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell, against Abyss. Abyss attempted to use a steel chair wrapped in barbed wire during the bout, but was stopped and it was taken away by <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> Near the end, Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mesias, however Mitchell distracted <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> from counting the pinfall. This allowed Mesias to spray red mist in Abyss' face and then follow by slamming Abyss face-first into the steel chair wrapped in barb-wire with his signature Straight to Hell maneuver at eleven minutes and three seconds.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E

5|$|The redeveloped Hampden was {{the venue}} for a boxing card headlined by former world {{champion}} Mike Tyson in June 2000. Tyson knocked down Lou Savarese after just 12 {{seconds of the}} fight, which <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> stopped after 38 seconds. The fight ended in farce as <b>the</b> <b>referee,</b> who had been attempting to separate the two fighters, was also knocked down by Tyson. The disappointed crowd booed Tyson out of the ring, while former fighters Jim Watt and Barry McGuigan criticised his actions. After the fight, Tyson claimed {{that he wanted to}} eat the children of world champion Lennox Lewis, which also drew criticism.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals {{were held}} on the September 2 episode of Impact!. Shelley and Waltman {{defeated}} the team of Hoyt and Konnan in the first semifinal match at 4 minutes and 22 seconds. During the match, Hoyt hit Waltman with a boot to the face and went for the pin, but <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> was distracted by Kip James who came down to ringside. Hoyt went to get <b>the</b> <b>referee,</b> giving Waltman the ability to {{hit him in the}} groin and follow-up by slamming him face-first into the mat with his signature X-Factor maneuver.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pay-per-view}} began, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) faced Rodney Mack and Christopher Nowinski. The Dudleyz initially {{dominated the}} match and executed the Wassup? on Nowinski. During the match, Theodore Long, Mack and Nowinski's manager, verbally distracted D-Von, resulting in D-Von punching Long and distracting <b>the</b> <b>referee.</b> Nowinski hit Bubba {{with a face}} mask that he wore. After <b>the</b> <b>referee</b> placed {{his attention to the}} match, Nowiniski pinned Bubba for the win.|$|E
