5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
5|$|The film clips are a motif used {{to enhance}} {{the theme of the}} desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are {{released}} over the internet and gain a cult following, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to Pattern Recognition written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E
