2500|$|The name Jocassee {{comes from}} the legend of a Cherokee maiden. An Oconee tribe, the [...] "Brown Vipers" [...] led by Chief Attakulla, {{inhabited}} {{the west side of}} the Whitewater river, while a rival tribe, [...] "The Green Birds", lived on the east. Legend says that a young Green Bird warrior, [...] Nagoochee was not afraid to enter Brown Viper hunting grounds. On one occasion, he fell and broke his leg and was convinced he was going to die. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Jocassee, Attakulla's daughter, who brought him back to her father's lodge and nursed him back to health. Jocassee eventually fell in love with him, but in a later battle, Cheochee, Jocassee's brother, killed and brought Nagoochee's head back on his belt. Legend has it that Jocassee went into the water and did not sink but walked across the water to meet the ghost of Nagoochee. The name Jocassee means [...] "Place of the Lost One." ...|$|E
2500|$|The scallop {{shell is}} a {{traditional}} reference to pilgrimage. For Pope Benedict XVI, it also reminded [...] him of the legend according to which one day St. Augustine, pondering {{the mystery of the}} Trinity, saw a child at the seashore playing with a shell, trying to put the water of the ocean into a little hole. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the words: This hole can no more contain the waters of the ocean than your intellect can comprehend the mystery of God. The crowned Moor is a regional motif in heraldry often seen in Bavaria, Benedict's German homeland. [...] Benedict has been quoted saying that, in addition to the obvious reference back to Saint Corbinian, the founder of the diocese where Benedict would become bishop in 1977, the bear represents Benedict himself being [...] "tamed by God" [...] to bear the spiritual burdens of Benedict's own ministries first as bishop, then as cardinal, and now as pope.|$|E

60|$|He {{slept in}} the guest-chamber, and at times during the night the child cried in Marcia's room and waked him; and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a sound of sobbing which was not the child's. In the morning, when he came down to breakfast, Marcia met him with swollen eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} meeting with Bukharin, the {{telephone}} rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from The Kremlin said, [...] "Comrade Stalin wishes to speak with you." [...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> his voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, {{what are they saying}} in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, The Guardian {{published}} evidence implicating Jan van Risseghem, {{a military}} pilot who {{served with the}} RAF during World War II, later with the Belgian Air Force and became famous as the pilot of Moise Tshombe in Katanga. [...] The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight {{on the night of}} the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola – 3,000 miles away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: [...] "I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I'm going down to make a run on it. Yes, it is the Transair DC-6. It's the plane," [...] adding that his voice was [...] "cool and professional". <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the sound of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: [...] "I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!" [...] Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website http://www.belgian-wings.be/ claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{story told}} by Dominic Charlie in 1965, he related {{about the first}} origins of his people. Their very first {{ancestor}} was a man named X̱i7lánexw , translated as The First One. He {{was born in a}} village near Squamish, British Columbia. [...] X̱i7lánexw [...] did not know that his wife was with child, but he knew that someone or something was coming. He knew of something coming because of a bird that goes ahead of three supernatural men. These three men, called the Transformers, told the Rave, [...] "You go tell everybody we are coming." [...] The first man understand the bird and he responded by getting ready with his canoe. Near the mouth of the Cheakamus River, is a small mountain, and a little bay that fit his canoe. He tied his canoe here and took out his pole, a long shaft used to pull along the river. He put moss around the pole, then placed the pole down. So when the fish touch the pole, their slime was wiped on the moss. He knew that the Transformers were coming further down river. He grabbed the pole and waited for a fish to touch it, then would pull out the pole and see where the salmon touched. He took the slime {{and put it in a}} wooden plate and put his pole down again. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the three brothers coming. Then the apocalypse came.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{that which}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{literally}} {{forced him to}} listen for more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{out of my}} way!" [...] roared the bully, and <b>then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Jack {{crashing}} through the brushwood directly behind him, he brushed Ruth rudely to one side.|$|R
60|$|He {{held his}} soapy brush {{suspended}} for a minute. They called this singing! His mind flitted back to early carol music. <b>Then</b> again <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the vocal violence outside.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> quite {{distinctly}} a soft pattering of feet {{in pursuit}} along the road.|$|E
60|$|Finally {{he heard}} a distant door slam. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a whistle, a merry whistle. It drew nearer and nearer; Farmer Brown's boy was coming to feed the hens. Reddy tried to hold his breath. He heard the click of the henyard gate as Farmer Brown's boy opened it, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the crunch, crunch, crunch of Farmer Brown's boy's feet on the snow.|$|E
60|$|Chet {{tried the}} door--to find it bolted. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a {{movement}} within, and the barrier was opened.|$|E
6000|$|No {{answer came}} back and he {{repeated}} the cry a dozen times. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a response directly ahead. The sloop was moved cautiously in the direction, and presently they saw Blumpo clinging to part of the shattered row-boat. [...] "Sabe me! sabe me!" [...] yelled the youth. [...] "Don't let me drown, Jerry." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{hands of}} the clock seemed to have stopped. <b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the umpire say [...] "Last over," [...] and he settled down to keep those six balls out of his wicket.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> Simmy <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a hoolet cry [...] In {{the chamber}} strang wi' never a licht; [...] "That's a hoolet, I ken," [...] did Simmy say, [...] "And I trow that Teviotdale's here the nicht!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> footsteps, {{and saw a}} small, {{swinging}} light. He {{immediately went}} towards this. It was a miner.|$|E
60|$|The dog first {{attracted}} his attention; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> her, {{and turned}} round. She {{had never seen}} him looking so despondent.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a rush {{of heavy}} feet, a shout from Rupert, a clash of swords, and a scream of agony.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> his sister's name, {{in every}} tone of pity, contempt, and horror, mingle with their angry exclamations, he awoke from his dream, and, {{bursting}} through the mob, made straight for Pelagia's house.|$|R
60|$|Hours {{seemed to}} pass, and <b>then</b> at last <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Psmith's voice saying good-bye to his host.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> with amazement <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{the bolt}} shoot {{back and a}} key grate in the keyhole.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> her piteous cry as {{her knees}} gave beneath her, and she {{sank to the}} ground in a swoon.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> footsteps, and, going out, met Leger at the door. The latter {{turned and}} came down the trail with him.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> that Miss McGoun had, a {{week after}} leaving him, gone over to his {{dangerous}} competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.|$|E
60|$|Another {{quarter of}} an hour went by and <b>then</b> Dick thought <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> voices. <b>He</b> {{strained}} his ears.|$|R
60|$|A distant tinkle of a bell {{made all}} her nerves {{suddenly}} quiver. Her father was awake <b>then?</b> <b>He</b> had <b>heard</b> the noise, and was ringing his bell {{to ask for}} an explanation of the disturbance.|$|R
60|$|At the end {{of three}} or four minutes, spent in patient waiting without hearing any sounds of a response, the {{stranger}} advanced and repeated the call in a more decided manner. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> footsteps in the hall, and sundry movements of the door-knob, but nobody appeared.|$|R
60|$|Outside, at {{the place}} where they ate, Mr. Clifford heard him gulping down raw gin from the bottle. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that'll settle him," [...] laughed the boy; {{but just}} <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> an angry shout, and looking around saw a {{policeman}} running toward him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} speak of Sylvia to this child--speak of his married life, {{hitherto}} so dignified, so almost sacred. It was impossible. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> her say: ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{possible}} that Clavering would have <b>heard</b> more had <b>he</b> followed the line of conduct he had adopted at first; but he stood thoughtfully silent instead, which did {{not by any means}} please his companion as well. He had a vague notion that this was a mistake; but the anger he did not show was too strong for him. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a footstep on the stairway, and laughed in a somewhat strained fashion.|$|R
60|$|Johnny Chuck {{ran down}} the long tunnel {{underground}} {{until he reached the}} end. <b>Then</b> when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Reddy Fox digging and knew that he was really coming, Johnny Chuck began to dig, too, only instead of digging down he dug up towards the sunshine and the blue sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not frighten." [...] The {{suggestion}} of a laugh in the deadened voice passed off in a catch of the breath. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> was <b>heard</b> beginning soberly: [...] "Your husband. [...] ." [...] He hesitated a little and she {{took the opportunity to}} say coldly: ...|$|R
