In the United States, the VG30E engine, which featured a variable intake manifold on both automatic and manual transmission models, was used on all 1989 to 1994 GXE models and 1989 to 1991 SE models. This generation Maxima was fitted with an independent rear suspension, {{and continued to}} offer the road scanning, electronic Super Sonic Suspension (sonar). An interesting feature was the digital touch entry system on the GXE (in conjunction with the new Luxury Package), which allowed the windows to be lowered and the moon roof opened from outside the vehicle on a keypad integrated {{on the front door}} handle without <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|E

Lisa put <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> and absently said to Katelyn, “Looks like someone’s waiting for our spot. ” Lisa started the car. Th e vehicle waiting for their spot honked. “Th at drives me nuts, ” Lisa said in response to the horn. “I’m going, I’m going. Be patient, ” she muttered under her breath to the driver of the other car. Although she had been about to put the car in reverse and pull out of the spot, she dug into her purse for her lipstick. “Lisa, that other car is waiting. Why aren’t you leaving? ” asked Katelyn. “I will, ” said Lisa. “I can’t put lipstick on while I’m driving. Besides, it’s my spot and I can stay in it as long as I want. ” “Now you’re being rude, ” Katelyn scolded her friend. “I always try to leave as quickly as I can when another car is waiting. ” “You do not, ” Lisa responded. “I’ve ridden with you and you make the other person wait. ” Lisa pulled out of the parking spot as Katelyn shot back: “Do not. ” “Do too, ” Lisa continued the argument. “Everyone takes longer to leave a parking spot when someone’s waiting. It’s an instinctual thing—we’re defending our territory. ” Katelyn responded with a snort. “Instinct? I don’t think so. People are nicer than that. Except for a few rude peopl...|$|E

If there are no racists here and racial disparities persist, then there are only three possible explanations. First, the disparities are residual effects of past racism that will fade away over time.
