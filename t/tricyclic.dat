5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a <b>tricyclic,</b> and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s, it {{was thought}} that the mode of action of <b>tricyclics</b> was to inhibit {{norepinephrine}} reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later <b>tricyclics</b> were thought to affect serotonin as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.|$|R

5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a <b>tricyclic</b> {{compound}} called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tricyclics</b> are {{chemical}} compounds that contain three interconnected rings of atoms.|$|R
25|$|In <b>tricyclics,</b> {{discontinuation}} syndrome {{symptoms include}} anxiety, insomnia, headache, nausea, malaise, or motor disturbance.|$|R
40|$|Opioids {{have been}} {{discovered}} to have Toll-like receptor (TLR) activity, beyond actions at classical opioid receptors. This raises the question whether other pharmacotherapies for pain control may also possess TLR activity, contributing to or opposing their clinical effects. We document that <b>tricyclics</b> can alter TLR 4 and TLR 2 signaling. In silico simulations revealed that several <b>tricyclics</b> docked to the same binding pocket on the TLR accessory protein, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD- 2), as do opioids. Eight <b>tricyclics</b> were tested for effects on TLR 4 signaling in HEK 293 cells over-expressing human TLR 4. Six exhibited mild (desipramine), moderate (mianserin, cyclobenzaprine, imiprimine, ketotifen) or strong (amitriptyline) TLR 4 inhibition, and no TLR 4 activation. In contrast, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine exhibited mild and strong TLR 4 activation, respectively, and no TLR 4 inhibition. Amitriptyline but not carbamazepine also significantly inhibited TLR 2 signaling in a comparable cell line. Live imaging of TLR 4 activation in RAW 264. 7 cells and TLR 4 -dependent interleukin- 1 release from BV- 2 microglia revealed that amitriptyline blocked TLR 4 signaling. Lastly, <b>tricyclics</b> with no (carbamazepine), moderate (cyclobenzeprine), and strong (amitriptyline) TLR 4 inhibition were tested intrathecally (rats) and amitriptyline tested systemically in wildtype and knockout mice (TLR 4 or MyD 88). While <b>tricyclics</b> {{had no effect on}} basal pain responsivity, they potentiated morphine analgesia in rank-order with their potency as TLR 4 inhibitors. This occurred in a TLR 4 /MyD 88 -dependent manner as no potentiation of morphine analgesia by amitriptyline occurred in these knockout mice. This suggests that TLR 2 and TLR 4 inhibition, possibly by interactions with MD 2, contributes to effects of <b>tricyclics</b> in vivo. These studies provide converging lines of evidence that several <b>tricyclics</b> or their active metabolites may exert their biological actions, in part, via modulation of TLR 4 and TLR 2 signaling and suggest that inhibition of TLR 4 and TLR 2 signaling may potentially contribute to the efficacy of <b>tricyclics</b> in treating chronic pain and enhancing the analgesic efficacy of opioids.

5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Debate {{continues}} {{over the}} relative merits of <b>tricyclics</b> and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as first line antidepressant treatment for depression. SSRIs are safer in overdose but more expensive than <b>tricyclics.</b> This report compared the hospital costs of cases of overdose with both groups of drug. METHODS: Records of all persons aged over thirteen years presenting to a general hospital in one year were analysed for demographic information and details of their attendance. RESULTS: There were 1165 episodes of self-poisoning, 151 involving <b>tricyclics</b> as the sole antidepressant and 69 SSRIs as the sole antidepressant. Those taking SSRIs had a shorter (1. 96 vs. 2. 59 days) and less expensive (pound 330 vs. pound 567) stay. A large proportion of this difference in cost was due to a small number of admissions to the Intensive Care Unit. LIMITATIONS: This study used only hospital costs, so excluding costs associated with primary care. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: If there were similar cost differences countrywide, the difference in hospital costs of self poisoning with SSRIs and <b>tricyclics</b> would represent an additional pound 3. 87 million per year due to self poisoning with <b>tricyclics</b> across the whole of England and Wales. This is a small proportion of the estimated pound 100 million cost of switching to first-line prescribing of SSRIs for depression...|$|R

50|$|Other {{antidepressants}} {{exist that}} have {{different ways of}} working than the SSRIs, <b>tricyclics,</b> and MAOIs. Commonly used ones are venlafaxine, nefazadone, bupropion, mirtazapine and trazodone.|$|R
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between {{the return of}} the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|E
25|$|Enuresis (involuntary urinating in sleep) in children. The {{effect may}} not be {{sustained}} following treatment, and alarm therapy {{may be more effective}} in both the short-term and the long-term. Combining a <b>tricyclic</b> (such as clomipramine) with anticholinergic medication, may be more effective for treating enuresis than the <b>tricyclic</b> alone.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} agents can be {{classified}} as either phenylpiperazines, benzylpiperazines, diphenylmethylpiperazines (benzhydrylpiperazines), pyridinylpiperazines, pyrimidinylpiperazines, or <b>tricyclics</b> (with the piperazine ring attached to the heterocyclic moiety via a side chain).|$|R
40|$|Postherpetic {{neuralgia}} {{is defined}} as pain persisting, or recurring, {{at the site of}} shingles at least three months after the onset of the acute rash. Thus defined, at least half of shingles sufferers over the age of 65 years develop postherpetic neuralgia. In addition to increasing age, less important risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia are pain severity of acute shingles and trigeminal distribution. Postherpetic neuralgia accounts for 11 - 15 % of all referrals to pain clinics and would, in fact, be far more effectively dealt with in primary care. Effective treatment of acute shingles by systemic antivirals at the appropriate time may have some effect in reducing the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia, making it easier to treat with <b>tricyclics</b> and greatly reducing scarring (25 % of all cases affect the face). Pre-emptive treatment with low-dose <b>tricyclics</b> (ami- or nor-triptyline 10 - 25 mg nocte) from the time of diagnosis of acute shingles reduces the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by about 50 %. Established postherpetic neuralgia should be vigorously treated with adrenergically active <b>tricyclics</b> in a dose rising over two or three weeks from 10 - 25 mg to 50 - 75 mg. Positive relaxation should also be used. Carbamazepine, like conventional analgesics, is of little or no value. Failure of <b>tricyclics</b> to effect relief within eight weeks calls for specialist treatment. North American practitioners in particular believe that some opioids (e. g., oxycodone) may be helpful in otherwise intractable cases...|$|R
50|$|Tiazesim (INN; {{brand name}} Altinil), {{also known as}} thiazesim (BAN, USAN) or thiazenone, is a heterocyclic {{antidepressant}} related to the <b>tricyclics</b> which, first introduced in 1966 by Squibb Corporation (now Bristol-Myers Squibb), has since been discontinued {{and is no longer}} marketed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tricyclic</b> {{antidepressant}}s: <b>Tricyclic</b> antidepressant {{prescription drugs}} with anti-muscarinic properties {{have been proven}} successful in treating bedwetting, but also have {{an increased risk of}} side effects, including death from overdose. These drugs include amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline. Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a placebo. The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.|$|E
25|$|Other {{medications}} {{which may}} be prescribed off-label include certain antidepressants such as <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants (TCAs), SNRIs, SSRIs, or MAOIs.|$|E
25|$|Death {{can occur}} from {{triazolam}} overdose but {{is more likely}} to occur in combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids, alcohol, or <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants.|$|E
30|$|Although {{far from}} certain, {{it is likely}} that {{different}} antidepressant classes confer different vulnerability to switching (Peet 1994; Gijsman et al. 2004; Tondo et al. 2010; Vasquez et al. 2013). <b>Tricyclics</b> are generally considered to have the highest switch rate while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bupropion confer the lowest risk. Serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (at least, venlafaxine) are associated with higher risks than SSRIs and bupropion (Vieta et al. 2002; Post et al. 2006). Whether this increased risk is shared with other SNRIs such as duloxetine and desmethylvenlafaxine is unknown. Switch rates with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are generally considered to be less than with <b>tricyclics</b> although data supporting this are not available (Himmelhoch et al. 1991).|$|R
50|$|Carpipramine (Prazinil, Defekton) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic {{used for}} the treatment of schizophrenia and anxiety in France and Japan. In addition to its neuroleptic and anxiolytic effects, carpipramine also has hypnotic properties. It is structurally related to both <b>tricyclics</b> like imipramine and butyrophenones like haloperidol.|$|R
50|$|A {{trial of}} the {{anticonvulsant}} drug carbamazepine is common for patients diagnosed with GN. For patients who do not tolerate or respond to carbamazepine, alternative drugs include oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and baclofen. In addition, <b>tricyclics</b> (e.g., amitriptyline) and pregabalin are useful in other types of neuropathic pain.|$|R
25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{can also}} {{interact}} {{with a number}} of psychoactive medications, including <b>tricyclic</b> antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and the potential of subsequent toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{concluded that}} antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, {{and sleep in}} fibromyalgia syndrome. <b>Tricyclics</b> {{appear to be the}} most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on <b>tricyclics</b> was 48% versus 28% for placebo. For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common. Antidepressants including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, milnacipran, moclobemide, and pirlindole are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on [...] "limited evidence".|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to these adverse effects, {{a different type of}} MAOI has been developed: the reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) class of drugs.
