25|$|The race saw him break Indianapolis victory lane {{tradition}} when {{he drank}} a celebratory bottle {{of orange juice}} instead of the traditional bottle of milk. He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. He was widely criticized and ridiculed for the action, even though he later <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> milk after the television cameras were off.|$|E
500|$|In October, 2003, Keibler {{appeared}} in the ring with Steve Austin. She was offered a beer, which she politely refused.

As a result, she received a Stone Cold Stunner.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Tyler's life, he {{suffered}} from poor health. As he aged, {{he suffered}} more frequently from colds during the winter. On January 12, 1862, after complaining of chills and dizziness, he vomited and collapsed. He was treated, but his health did not improve, and he made {{plans to return to}} Sherwood Forest by the 18th. As he lay in bed the night before, he began suffocating, and Julia summoned his doctor. Just after midnight, Tyler <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> brandy, and told his doctor, [...] "I am going. Perhaps it is best." [...] He died shortly thereafter, most likely due to a stroke.|$|E
50|$|A special {{attraction}} are the Wine {{roads of}} Moslavina, where <b>a</b> visitor can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Croatian and regional genuine wine Škrlet (Skrlet).|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my dear, just <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> this, and don't cry any more. We'll {{straighten}} things out. So cheer up, {{and let me}} lend a hand anywhere, anyhow." ...|$|R
5000|$|LaMont, meanwhile, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the {{prototype}} “Mary Poppins” and is instantly transported {{to a dark}} room where he meet’s not Burt, but Dirt, the English chimney sweeper that won’t stop offering LaMont food.|$|R
60|$|On {{these words}} the Swede stopped {{with a certain}} sense of the dramatic. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> whisky.|$|E
60|$|Private Biggs, who {{had brought}} his {{sparkling}} limado and a bath-bun with him from the other table, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the former, and embarked upon his narrative.|$|E
60|$|Here, {{the little}} gentleman paused, {{and took a}} long pull at his brandy-and-water. Mr. Watkins Tottle <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his, stirred the fire, and assumed an air of {{profound}} attention.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 ad, {{a student}} in <b>a</b> college lecture <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> Dr Pepper. When he stops drinking, the Dr Pepper can sings {{variations}} of [...] "Flava Licious" [...] (Flavor Flav), and {{other people in the}} room start dancing.|$|R
60|$|Here the worthy Peechy {{paused to}} take breath and to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the gossip tankard that stood at his elbow. His {{auditors}} remained with open mouths and outstretched necks, gaping like {{a nest of}} swallows for an additional mouthful.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. I {{have brought}} a couple of bottles of wine I got {{at one of the}} traders' stores, yesterday. You must <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> that, and then we will leave you to {{yourself}} for a bit, and you must lie down and have a good nap." ...|$|R
6000|$|Old Heythorp took up {{the long}} green glass, drained it, and {{repressing}} fumes and emotion went on with his partridge. His daughter pursed her lips, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kybird hesitated and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his gin and water. Then he {{regarded}} {{the wife of}} his bosom with a calculating glance which at once excited that lady's easily kindled wrath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, little boy," [...] he cried, [...] "let's have a jolly evening together. Your {{very good}} health, little boy," [...] {{and here he}} jingled his mug against Martin's, and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{your friend}} ill?" [...] said he. [...] "He has not our English {{ruggedness}} of look. He {{would have done}} better to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the cool tankard, and {{a slice of the}} cold beef. He finds no such food and drink as that in his own country, I warrant." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2014 - Diet Coke invites {{consumers}} to 'Get A Taste' {{of the good}} life. This campaign asks the question [...] "what if life tasted this good?".

5|$|In the video, Selena {{is sitting}} in a {{restaurant}} where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her a glass of water. As the singer enjoys her dinner, the waiter returns with a note saying that her lover (for whom she has been waiting) has left her for another woman. Selena <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|R
60|$|They clinked {{their glasses}} again; and Walter, who was {{hoarding}} his wine, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> it, {{and held the}} glass up to his eye with as critical an air as he could possibly assume.|$|E
60|$|Thus prevailed on to at {{any rate}} taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when {{taken up by the}} handle and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the {{offending}} beverage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hum!' he said. Then 'Umph!' in a protesting tone, as {{if someone}} had pinched him. Finally, he gave vent to a long-drawn 'Um-m-m,' in a deep bass. 'Most extraordinary. Really, most extraordinary. Exceedingly. Yes. Um. Very.' He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> coffee.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of those}} places where you could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his native air was Russicum with the Russian church, with family icons and {{expensive}} Slavic rites. Brailovsky were parishioners of the church. Years later, Archpriest Alexander Sipyagin who knew Leonid Mikhailovich wrote in his obituary: [...] "Here, {{and especially in the}} Church of St. Anthony, the late felt like at home".|$|R
6000|$|... "You had a {{tremendous}} shake," [...] said Colonel Tempe--who was, with Tim, by this time kneeling beside him--"and your horse is blown almost to pieces; but I don't think, as far as I can see, at present, that you are hit anywhere. Here, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> brandy. It will bring you round; you are stunned a little, you know.|$|R
5000|$|... 奶蓋茶 (pinyin: nǎi gài chá): [...] "milk cap tea": A layered tea drink where regular tea without milk {{is served}} on the bottom, with a frothy layer of cream on top (hence the name milk cap). Milk, salt and/or cheese, giving it a {{slightly}} salty taste.

60|$|The {{chairman}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water, and resumed. Almost all in {{the last}} six rows were now on their feet, and amid a hubbub of murmurs the chairman held out to the secretary the slips of his speech, and fell heavily back into his chair.|$|E
6000|$|To oblige him, we at last <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his [...] "arva tee," [...] {{and found}} it very crude, and strong as Lucifer. Curious to know whence it was obtained, we {{questioned}} him; when, lighting up with pleasure, he seized the taper, and led us outside the hut, bidding us follow.|$|E
60|$|The spy, well used to his business, did {{not change}} his {{unconscious}} attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.|$|E
5000|$|One month later, a girl is seen {{running with}} a mojito to a rocky beach in an unknown locale. There, a poorly {{disguised}} Thad, under the alias of [...] "Mr. Poontang," [...] <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> it, only to angrily declare that it lacks lime. As the girl hastily runs {{back to the}} bar to correct the mistake, he finds the lime [...] "hidden under all the mint" [...] and tells her to return.|$|R
5000|$|Muscadine is {{a country}} wine with a place {{deep in the heart}} of many of Louisiana's people. They have fond {{memories}} of picking them fresh and eating them as a refreshing snack on those hot August days when they ripen every time they <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sweet white. Muscadines make a great wine for many types of Louisiana cuisine, providing you with a unique wine with a unique food and life style.|$|R
5000|$|In modern times, Mongol horses may {{be blessed}} with a {{sprinkling}} of mare's milk before a race. [...] After the national Naadam races, the winning horses are sprinkled with mare's milk, and the top five horses in each racing category are named the [...] "airag's five." [...] After a Naadam wrestling match, the winner will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> airag and toss some into the air. Milk may also be sprinkled after people who are leaving on a journey.|$|R
6000|$|Osmond <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> a {{glass of}} wine; he looked {{perfectly}} good-humoured. [...] "My dear Amy," [...] he answered, smiling {{as if he were}} uttering a piece of gallantry, [...] "I don't know anything about your convictions, but if I suspected that they interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish YOU." ...|$|E
60|$|I remembered. His {{handsome}} old face, {{so fresh}} for his age, unmarked by any trying experience, appeared haggard for an instant. It {{was like the}} passing of a shadow. Returning his steadfast gaze, I <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> my black coffee. He was systematically minute in his narrative, simply in order, I think, not to let his excitement {{get the better of}} him.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bickersdyke spoke well. He had a penetrating, if harsh, voice, and he {{said what}} he had to say forcibly. Little by little the {{audience}} came under his spell. When, at the end of a well-turned sentence, he paused and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water, there was a round of applause, in which many of the admirers of Mr Harry Lauder joined.|$|E
5000|$|A verbal {{example is}} the catchphrase [...] "Chor dai yum daam cha, sik gor bau" [...] (...) , meaning [...] "Let's sit down, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> tea, and have a bao (a Chinese bun)", first uttered by Stephen Chow in the TV serial The Final Combat (...) [...] The phrase becomes mo lei tau because it is {{repeated}} in irrelevant and inappropriate situations. It {{also serves as a}} comedic device because the actions suggested by [...] "sitting, drinking and eating" [...] are so plain and normal.|$|R
50|$|Still at home, Robert shaves in {{a rather}} awkward fashion. He then finds out he's late for work and eats a spoonful of instant coffee and one <b>of</b> sugar, and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> cream and one of water, and finally shakes himself up before leaving his flat. Meanwhile Perry <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> bus to Sloane Square, where a sarcastic bus {{conductor}} proceeds to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> slice off a pound bill since Dave just had 15 pence instead of the 16p the conductor charged him, disbelieving the fact that Perry {{was in fact a}} comedian.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Excess Baggage" [...] starts with Staind frontman, Aaron Lewis, walking into, presumably, a bathroom. He {{sits down on}} the toliet with the seat down, and you can hear some metal clanging and then the metal falls to the floor. No one really knows what made the noise. Then Aaron <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beverage, or wine, from a wine glass. Then he starts playing the song. An {{interesting}} thing is that Aaron was unaware he was being recorded. No one knows who had secretly recorded Aaron.|$|R
