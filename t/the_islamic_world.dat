5|$|The {{earliest}} geometrical {{forms in}} Islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and lozenges containing squares.

5|$|During their {{relatively}} short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered {{in an era}} of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world.</b> This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} the natural world {{extended}} to a detailed examination of plants. The work done was directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world.</b> Al-Dinawari popularised botany in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world</b> with his six-volume Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. In what survives, 637 plants are described in alphabetical order from the letters sin to ya, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. Zakariya al-Qazwini's thirteenth century encyclopedia ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt (The Wonders of Creation) contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book Dīwān al-filāha (The Court of Agriculture), and Ibn al-'Awwam al-Ishbīlī of Seville in his 12th century book Kitāb al-Filāha (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world,</b> returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them. It covered leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested. He gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{argued that}} the economy {{established}} by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques across <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world,</b> {{as well as the}} adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it. Crops from Africa, such as sorghum, from China, such as citrus fruits, and from India, such as mango, rice, cotton and sugar cane, were distributed throughout Islamic lands, which, in his opinion, had not previously grown these plants. He listed eighteen such crops. He further {{argued that the}}se introductions, along with an increased mechanization of agriculture and irrigation, led to major changes in economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production and income, population, urban growth, distribution of the labour force, industries linked to agriculture, cooking, diet and clothing in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to WIN-Gallup International's Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism project, Turkey is {{the country}} with most irreligious Muslims in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world</b> with 73% of its Muslim population. In light of an {{extensive}} PEW Global research, only 15% of Muslims in Turkey say prayers {{for at least one}} of the five prayers either at home or in a mosque. Another PEW Report suggests that, only 7% to 13% of all Turks think that religion should have an effect on laws directly or indirectly.|$|E

5|$|After its {{dedication}} in 972, {{and with}} the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al Karaouine in Umayyad Fes. Al-Azhar University has long been regarded as the foremost institution in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world</b> {{for the study of}} Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although the mosque-school was {{the leading}} {{university}} in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world</b> and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas. Al-Azhar's student body was organized in riwaqs (fraternities) along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

However, in 1370 the latter saw a revival as {{the capital of the}} Timurid Empire. The Turko-Mongol ruler Timur forcefully brought artisans and intellectuals from across Asia to Samarkand, transforming it not only into a trade hub but {{also one of the most}} important cities of <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, both in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world</b> and in Europe, {{agriculture}} {{was transformed}} with improved techniques and {{the diffusion of}} crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus.

5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center of {{learning}} in <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>world,</b> and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there.

Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.|$|E

Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC.
