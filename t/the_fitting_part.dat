The double-curved shape manufacturing may be difficult {{and can lead to}} defects when the composite parts have high curvatures and large deformations. Compared with the textile composites forming, surface 3 D weaving can demonstrate directly the geometry of final composite part without the stages involved in 2 D product. The weaving in three directions is completely designed and warp and weft yarns are always perpendicular to the surfaces of the final 3 D ply. These two manufacturing techniques are applied to produce an important piece of aircraft: <b>the</b> corner <b>fitting.</b> <b>The</b> 3 D weaving results are compared with the experimental forming by a punch as same geometry as <b>the</b> corner <b>fitting</b> <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> conveniences and limits of each technique are investigated.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{device for}} textile composite reinforcement forming is presented. A strongly double curved tetrahedral shape is formed by punch and die. This shape is those of <b>the</b> corner <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> used as corner brackets. The device shows {{that is possible}} to obtain such geometry by punch and die forming thanks to strong blank holder loads and an appropriate reinforcement. There is no wrinkle in the tetrahedral part of the formed shape but the six blank holders create wrinkles in the plane part of the preform. The shear angles reach 60 ° {{but there is no}} wrinkling in this zone. The presented forming process enables the experimental validation of a semi-discrete simulation approach. It is shown that shear angles and wrinkle shapes obtained by this numerical approach are in good agreement with the forming experiment. The computation of the shape of wrinkles after forming is necessary to check that these wrinkles do not expand to the useful part of the preform. This needs to take the bending stiffnesses into account. This is not the case when the simulation is based on a membrane approach...|$|R
40|$|The DEEP (Dynamical Exascale Entry Platform) project aims {{to provide}} a first {{implementation}} of a novel architecture for heterogeneous high-performance computing. This architecture consists of a standard HPC Cluster and – tightly coupled –a cluster of many-core processors called Booster. This concept offers application developers the opportunity to run different parts of their program on <b>the</b> best <b>fitting</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> machine striving for an optimal overall performance.

To provide optimal support to the application developers the DEEP concept includes a high-level programming model that helps to separate a given program to the Cluster and Booster parts of the DEEP System. This paper presents the adaption work required for a Particle-in-Cell space weather application developed by KU Leuven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) done in the course of the DEEP project. It discusses all crucial steps of the work starting with a scalability analysis of the different parts of the program, their performance projections for the Cluster and the Booster leading to the separation decisions for the application and finally the actual implementation work.

30|$|The {{algorithm}} for {{the evaluation}} of parameters of rotationally symmetric aspheric surfaces was described and tested. The sub-nanometre precision of fitting was reached with this new robust and fast algorithm. The algorithm also does not need precise estimation of parameters for the initial iteration. It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and alignment markers on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections. Moreover, the part of algorithm that finds the correct coordinate system and removes outliers can be used independently on <b>the</b> conic section <b>fitting</b> <b>part.</b> Thus <b>the</b> algorithm will be useful for the optical community for precise characterisation and testing of aspheric lens.|$|R
40|$|Deformable models {{represent}} a useful approach to approximate objects from collected data points. We propose {{to augment the}} basic approaches designed to handle mostly compact objects or objects of known topology. Our approach can fit simultaneously more than one curve or surface to approximate multiple topologically complex objects by using (1) the residual data points, (2) <b>the</b> badly <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> approximating surface, and (3) appropriate Boolean operations. In 2 -D, B-snakes [3] are used to approximate each object (pattern). In 3 -D, an analytical surface representation, based on the elements detected, is presented. The global representation of a 3 -D object, in terms of elements and their connection, {{takes the form of}} B-spline and Bézier surfaces. A Bézier surface is used to connect different elements, and the connecting surface itself conforms to the data points nearby through energy minimization. This way, a G 1 continuity surface is achieved for the underlying 3 -D object. We present experiments on synthetic and real data in 2 -D and 3 -D. In these experiments, multiple complex patterns and objects with through holes are segmented. The system proceeds automatically without human interaction or any prior knowledge of the topology of the underlying object. c ○ 1999 Academic Press Key Words: snakes; deformable model; B-spline; segmentation; energy minimization...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of collectively classifying entities where relational information is available across the entities. In practice inaccurate class distribution for each entity is often available from another (external) classifier. For example this distribution could come from a classifier built using content features or a simple dictionary. Given the relational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two graph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be solved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a subset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a transductive setting. In the other setting the class distributions of all nodes are used to define <b>the</b> <b>fitting</b> function <b>part</b> of a graph regularized objective function. We define a generalized objective function that handles both the settings. Methods like harmonic Gaussian field and local-global consistency (LGC) {{reported in the literature}} can be seen as special cases. We extend the LGC and weighted vote relational neighbor classification (WvRN) methods to support usage of external classifier information. We also propose an efficient least squares regularization (LSR) based method and relate it to information regularization methods. All the methods are evaluated on several benchmark and real world datasets. Considering together speed, robustness and accuracy, experimental results indicate that the LSR and WvRN-extension methods perform better than other methods. ...|$|R

30|$|OE {{is defined}} as the total output up to time T, {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of the}} total input up to that time. In case of MAG 3, this is usually calculated by <b>fitting</b> <b>the</b> rising <b>part</b> of the background corrected total kidney TAC to the integral of the input function and then multiplying the value of the TAC at time T with a factor obtained from the fit (Chaiwatanarat et al. 1993), which was done automatically by the Hermes Renogram Analysis software. Due to its sharp initial peak (Fig.  2 a), the FDG TAC does not have enough rising data points to allow a valuable fitting procedure, which inhibits an application of this method. Instead, the strong linear correlation between OEref and MTTref (as reported by Fleming and Kemp (1999)) was used to convert MTTref to OEref by linear regression. The resulting slope and intercept were used to finally calculate OEFDG from MTTFDG.|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic factors (SF) play an {{important}} role in nuclear physics and astrophysics. The traditional method of extracting SF from direct transfer reactions suffers from serious ambiguities.

In the modified method the contribution of the external part of the reaction amplitude, typically dominant, is fixed and the SF is determined from <b>fitting</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>part.</b> We illustrate the modified method with (d,p) reactions on ^ 208 Pb, ^ 12 C, and ^ 84 Se targets at different energies. The modified method allows one to extract the SF, which do not depend on the shape of the single-particle nucleon-target interaction, and has the potential of improving the reliability and accuracy of the structure information.
