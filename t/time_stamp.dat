5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC <b>time</b> <b>stamp,</b> but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E

25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} <b>time</b> <b>stamp.</b> The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the <b>time</b> <b>stamp.</b> To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E

2500|$|Theodosius I, who {{initially}} reigned {{only in the}} east as co-emperor, had been relatively tolerant towards pagans {{in the early part}} of his reign. [...] He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign. For example, he appointed the pagan Eutolmius Tatianus as the praetorian prefect of Egypt. For the first part of his rule, Theodosius seems to have ignored the semi-official standing of the Christian bishops. In fact, he had voiced his support for the preservation of temples or pagan statues as useful public buildings. In his early reign, Theodosius was fairly tolerant of the pagans, for he needed the support of the influential pagan ruling class.

2500|$|When {{a binary}} star system is aligned such that – from the Earth's {{point of view}} – the stars pass {{in front of each}} other in their orbits, the system is called an [...] "eclipsing binary" [...] star system. The time of minimum light, when the star with the {{brighter}} surface is at least partially obscured by the disc of the other star, is called the primary eclipse, and approximately half an orbit later, the secondary eclipse occurs when the brighter surface area star obscures some portion of the other star. These times of minimum light, or central eclipses, constitute a <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> on the system, much like the pulses from a pulsar (except that rather than a flash, they are a dip in brightness). If there is a planet in circumbinary orbit around the binary stars, the stars will be offset around a binary-planet center of mass. As the stars in the binary are displaced back and forth by the planet, the times of the eclipse minima will vary. The periodicity of this offset may be the most reliable way to detect extrasolar planets around close binary systems. With this method, planets are more easily detectable if they are more massive, orbit relatively closely around the system, and if the stars have low masses.|$|E

2500|$|Murray {{complained to}} Victor Huguet (a French liaison officer serving with the British) about Wilson (6 October), but also told Wilson that French was getting “more unreasonable” and asked Wilson whether he (Murray) should resign; Wilson {{informed}} Billy Lambton, French’s secretary, {{of both of}} these incidents. Murray also (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him. Murray later wrote (in 1930) [...] "Why did I stay with (this) War Office clique when I knew I was not wanted? I wanted to see Sir John through. I had been so many years with him, and knew better than anyone how his health, temper and temperament rendered him unfit, in my opinion, for the crisis we had to face. ..... the senior members (of GHQ staff) entirely ignored me, as far as possible, continually thwarted me, even altered my instructions." [...] He also claimed that Wilson's disloyalty had left him the impossible job of managing Sir John alone. Rawlinson noted in his diary that Murray became “a cipher at GHQ” (28 Nov 1914), was disliked by his subordinates (4 December) and that Sir John French often ignored his staff “chiefly because Murray is incapable of managing them and getting any good work out of them” (6 Dec 1914). Edmonds later claimed that Murray sometimes falsified the timing of orders, but he was given away by the <b>time</b> <b>stamp</b> which the duty clerk placed on them.|$|E
2500|$|The goal of WALTA {{is to set}} up {{detectors}} {{at least}} 32 sites in the Seattle area, covering an area of 200 square kilometers. [...] This area would be large enough to detect events above the GZK cutoff. [...] The program hopes to fill in gaps in this area as the project matures. [...] Each location has four scintillation detectors which emit light when hit by charged particles. [...] Each paddle detectors is about an inch thick and covers approximately one square meter. [...] Each site would ideally put the detectors in a star formation with one detector in the middle and three surrounding it on a circle of 10m2 radius. [...] With this geometry, each site could detect 1015eV events. [...] Each site will attempt this layout as best possible given the site's own geography. [...] Each detector has a photomultiplier tube which multiplies the emitted light into a large electrical signal. [...] The signal from each detector paddle goes into a data acquisition card (DAQ) which is set to record an event based on a certain coincidence. [...] The DAQ card also has a GPS input. [...] The output of this card connects to a computer using a serial port and software counts the data with a GPS location and <b>time</b> <b>stamp.</b> [...] A site can upload the data to the WALTA server and data can be compared to see if events happen from the same shower.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{distributed}} system with N processes, <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> of size N (such as vector clocks) {{are necessary to}} accurately track potential causality between events.

In this paper, we define a new metric, imprecision, that formally characterizes the fidelity of a plausible clock. We present a new plausible clock system that guarantees an arbitrary constant bound on imprecision. This bound is achieved by allowing <b>time</b> <b>stamps</b> to grow and shrink {{over the course of the}} computation.
