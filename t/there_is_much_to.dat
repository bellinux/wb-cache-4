Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E

St. James, 'uptown' Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities.

25|$|Because of {{the damage}} done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, {{he was elected to the}} National Convention, where he {{represented}} the far left. He was a member of the Piques section, notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of direct vote. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> suggest that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the aide-de-camp to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save himself. Later that year, his name was added – whether by error or wilful malice – to the list of émigrés of the Bouches-du-Rhône department.|$|E

25|$|Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) - Bareketh {{etymologically}} means ‘lightning flash’, whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with Emerald, {{and literally}} means green stone, but is {{somewhat of a}} false friend as the Greek term could apply {{to a number of}} different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the proper sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text doesn't appear to specify colour); <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although “emerald” is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezek. 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as “onyx.” Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = barḳan, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as “agate.” In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of barḳan) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet in Exo. 28:17.|$|E
500|$|Whatever his motivations, Mason {{proved a}} {{forceful}} advocate {{for a bill}} of rights whose Objections helped accomplish his aims. Rutland noted that [...] "from the opening phrase of his Objections to the Bill of Rights that James Madison offered in Congress two years later, the line is so direct that we can say that Mason forced Madison's hand. Federalist supporters of the Constitution could not overcome the protest caused by Mason's phrase 'There is no declaration of rights'."

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it [...] "offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could– and probably should– have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show." [...] John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.|$|E
500|$|Like Angelou's {{previous}} autobiographies, Song received mostly positive reviews, although as the Poetry Foundation has said: [...] "Most {{critics have}} judged Angelou's subsequent autobiographies {{in light of}} her first, and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings remains the most highly praised." [...] Kim Hubbard of People Magazine, for example, found Song unsatisfying and [...] "hastily assembled", but poetic like Caged Bird. [...] Many reviewers appreciated what Kirkus Reviews called Angelou's [...] "nice structural turn" [...] of framing Song with two assassinations. [...] Paula Friedman of The New York Times Book Review appreciated Angelou's [...] "occasions of critical self-assessment and modesty" [...] not present in many other autobiographies. [...] Patricia Elam of New Crisis agreed, stating that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> admire both about the book and about the [...] "large life", full of tension, laughter, and love, it describes. [...] Elam also called Song [...] "a spirit-moving work that describes Angelou's journey through an authentic and artistic life".|$|E
500|$|In September 1922, Filkins again {{excavated}} at the site, {{this time}} with the aid of Gravesend resident Charles Gilbert. Their project was financed through grants provided by the British Association and the Society of Antiquaries, with Filkins noting {{that at the time of}} its commencement, [...] "a miniature jungle" [...] had grown up around the site which had to be cleared. Excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926. Human remains were discovered, and placed into the possession of Sir Arthur Keith of the Royal College of Surgeons, although it is also recorded that at some point between 1939 and 1945 human remains that had been found at the site were reburied in the churchyard at Trottiscliffe. This excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument, several which had previously been buried. The stones of the chamber were shored up with concrete foundations where Filkins deemed it necessary. Although Filkins' excavation was comprehensive, it did ignore stone holes, packing stones, and their relationship to the mound. In 1998, Ashbee noted that while from [...] "a present-day perspective, it is possible to see shortcomings in terms of the general standards of the early part of this century, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> commend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, the Savoy was not {{the right}} place to produce such a drama, because its {{audience}} was used to seeing comic operas focused on wit, humour and Gilbertian satire. [...] To provide them with a mostly dark-toned romantic piece consisting of pseudo-medieval dialogue (and too much of it), lengthy grand-operatic musical numbers and a serious exploration of complex characters {{turned out to be a}} grave mistake. [...] In addition, The Beauty Stone is a very long piece [...] it played for nearly four hours on opening night; several items were cut soon after opening night, but the cuts did not improve matters. [...] At the same time, competition from the new theatrical art form of George Edwardes-style musical comedy produced at other London theatres offered lighthearted entertainment choices to the Savoy audience, with catchy tunes, dancing and witty banter. [...] For a modern audience, however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> admire about The Beauty Stone. [...] Pinero's book, though overly long, contains vivid characters with psychological depth that Sullivan was able to develop more fully than in his shorter comic operas. The complex way in which these characters react to the beauty stone makes this plot device different from the way Gilbert treated his magic lozenges and gave Sullivan a chance to employ rich musical portraits of yearning, despair, love and beauty.|$|E
