The objective of the research is to find out {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> when this is applied in teaching speaking at SMP Negeri 1 Karangawen Demak. Based on the pre test score in the pre-research, the students found difficulties in speaking competences: pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar, and content. The subject of the research was the 9 -E class students of SMP Negeri 1 Karangawen, 2010 / 2011. The research was categorized as classroom action research. The researcher performed three cycles, each cycle consists of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. In collecting the data, the researcher applied several techniques including observation, interview, and performance assessment. The quantitative data referred to students’ speaking scores which were taken from post test. It was analyzed by descriptive statistics. The qualitative data dealt with the process of conducting lesson in the classroom. It was conducted by using the students’ observation sheet during the process of the teaching and learning. The findings prove that the research on improving students’ speaking competence using <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> in the 9 -E students of SMP Negeri 1 Karangawen is successful viewed from several aspects. First, <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> can improve the students’ speaking competence. Second, they can raise the students’ attention concerning the teacher’s explanation. Third, they can make the students imitate the pronunciations well. Fourth, they can raise students’ motivation to respond the teacher’s questions. Fifth, they can establish the students’ interaction. Sixth, they can encourage students to ask questions. Seventh, they can make the students active to finish the tasks. Eighth, they can give creative ideas in group discussions. Ninth, they can improve the students’ participation in group discussions. The research findings of the study imply that <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> is an effective technique to improve the students’ speaking competence. Therefore, it is recommended that: (1) other English teachers use <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> in <b>teaching</b> speaking; (2) the institution encourages teachers to apply <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> in <b>teaching</b> speaking by providing more budgets to make <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> or to buy them; (3) other researchers develop the <b>teaching</b> <b>aids</b> which have not been developed in this research. ...|$|R
