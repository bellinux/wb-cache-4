5|$|In 1935, Clouzot was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all.

French cinema had changed {{because many of the}} producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E

25|$|The guecha warriors enjoyed special {{privileges}} and were considered a higher {{class of the}} society. They ranked below the priests, but above the general people. Both Pedro Simón and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita describe the guecha warriors as strong and brave men, recruited from {{the people in the}} various villages of the Muisca Confederation. They went through years of training in combat before being assigned as guecha warrior. Their appearance was different from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> of which the men had long hair. To be more efficient and safer in battle, the guecha warriors cut their hair short. While jewellery was not common among the general people, and after installation of the Code of Nemequene even prohibited, the guecha warriors wore jewels such as golden or tumbaga nose pieces, pectorals, earrings and crowns with coloured feathers. The amount of earrings would indicate the number of enemies beaten. Their bodies were painted using inks from the Genipa americana tree.|$|E
25|$|To {{investigate}} {{if people}} would help {{others in the}} presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.|$|E
