5|$|The Ottoman attackers dug {{themselves}} in {{on a line}} through Balin and Berkusie while the line {{taken up by the}} Australian Mounted Division began with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade facing east on a line running due north from about half way between Iraq el Menshiye and Summil. The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of Ipseir and connecting with the right of the infantry division; the 75th Division at Suafir esh Sharqiye. A critical situation created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> and steadiness of the troops, especially the machine-gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E

His conduct was worthy of the experience and science of our most approved and veteran Admirals, while the ardour and promptitude with which his orders were obeyed and his plans executed by the several Captains under his command, may have been rivalled, but can scarcely be exceeded in the most renowned of our naval exploits.

500|$|Hirst was {{recalled}} for {{the final}} Test and played a vital role. Wisden said that he bowled {{as well as he}} had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse. Although Australia recovered, he had figures of five for 77. With Len Braund, Hirst then helped England to avoid the follow-on, scoring 43 and according to Wisden [...] "hitting with the utmost freedom." [...] Hirst took a further wicket as Australia were dismissed for 121. England, needing 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from Gilbert Jessop gave England a chance. Hirst scored 58 not out, making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in the later stages of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll get 'em in singles", but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket victory. Wisden described Hirst as playing [...] "a great game", noted <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> of his play under pressure and said that [...] "Hirst's innings was in its way almost as remarkable as Jessop's".|$|E

500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following morning when he attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only was he a good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, [...] "It is to <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day." ...|$|E
2500|$|But bribery {{played a}} big part in foreign {{relations}} also. A good example is the Dutch Gift the States General gave to Charles II of England in 1660 to get back in his good graces after <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> of the mutual relations that reigned during Charles's years of exile in France. The bribe consisted of a number of precious paintings worth the not inconsiderable sum of 80,000 guilders, and the yacht HMY Mary, like the yacht on which he was comfortably transported home to England [...] during the Restoration. The gift was mostly paid for by the Amsterdam vroedschap, who came to regret their unaccustomed generosity when Charles unfolded his anti-Dutch policy. Fortunately, most of the paintings were repatriated to the Netherlands by William III of England after he had become king, so the financial outlay had not been a complete waste.|$|E

2500|$|Particularly {{within the}} context of {{religion}} – a domain which is often associated with sexual asceticism – Muḥammad is notable for emphasising the importance of loving women. According to a famous ḥadīth, Muḥammad stated: [...] "Three things of this world of yours were made lovable to me: women, perfume – and <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> of my eye was placed in the ritual prayer". This is enormously significant because in the Islamic faith, Muḥammad is by definition the most perfect human being and the most perfect male: his love for women shows that the perfection of the human state is connected with love for other human beings, not simply with love for God. More specifically, it illustrates that male perfection lies in women and, by implication, female perfection in men. Consequently, the love Muḥammad had for women is obligatory on all men, since he is the model of perfection that must be emulated.|$|E
2500|$|Assault {{was first}} {{released}} in Los Angeles at the State Theater on November 3, 1976 to mixed reviews and unimpressive box office earnings. Whitney Wiliams of Variety wrote, [...] "Some exciting {{action in the}} second half packs enough interest to keep this entry alive for the violence market... John Carpenter's direction of his screenplay, after a pokey opening half, is responsible for the realistic movement." [...] Dan O'Bannon, Carpenter's co-writer on Dark Star, attended the Los Angeles premiere. At this point in their professional relationship, O'Bannon was jealous of Carpenter's success and reluctantly attended the premiere. O'Bannon was disgusted by the film and told Carpenter so. According to author Jason Zinoman, O'Bannon saw a reflection of <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> that Carpenter displayed toward him in the film's casual disregard for the humanity of its characters. It reminded him of how easily their friendship had been discarded. [...] "His disdain for human beings would be serviced if he could make a film without people in it," [...] replied O'Bannon.|$|E

[...] During the fighting Rivière was killed. [...] Complete catastrophe was only averted by <b>the</b> <b>coolness</b> of lieutenant de vaisseau Pissère, who assumed command of the demoralised French column, deployed the French infantry behind a dyke on the eastern side of Paper Bridge, and beat off a number of attempts by the Black Flags to cross the bridge and follow up their victory. [...] The battle eventually died down, and Pissère marched the defeated French column back to Hanoi in good order.|$|E

Despite the Confidential article, Scott remained active on the Hollywood dating circuit, but the allegations continued to haunt her. A friend, David Patrick Columbia, noted: [...] "One night driving her home from a party we’d been to, she remarked apropos of nothing we’d been talking about, 'and you know David, I am not a lesbian.'" [...] Scott herself tended toward secrecy about her personal relationships and publicly disparaged former dates who told all to the press. Once their date appears in the press, [...] "...the man goes off [...] date list... 'I think,' said Miss Scott, 'that gentlemen don't tell.'" [...] In 1948, Burt Lancaster said of Scott: [...] "Becoming her close friend... is 'a long stretch at hard labor.'" [...] In the period between 1945 and the 1970s, the press reported Scott dating Van Johnson, James Mason, Helmut Dantine, plastic surgeon Gregory Pollock, Richard Quine, William Dozier, Philip Cochran, Herb Caen, Peter Lawford, Anson Bond of the clothing store chain family, Seymour Bayer of the pharmaceutical family, Marquess of Milford Haven, race-track owner Gerald [...] "Jerry" [...] Herzfeld, and Eddie Sutherland, among others.
