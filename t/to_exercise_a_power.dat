500|$|Several {{influential}} {{decisions of}} the House of Lords have determined the limited scope {{for the use of}} prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, Re Petition of Right ("Shoreham Aerodrome Case"), but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation. The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown, both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative, was entitled to take and occupy, for military purposes in wartime, a commercial airfield on the south coast. The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised, the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists. This was backed up by The Zamora (1916), where the Privy Council, on appeal from the Prize Court, held generally that <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> not granted by statute (such as a prerogative power) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified. The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd (1920), where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use [...] "abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent – that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance".|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the grounds {{required for the}} dissolution of the parliament in the political practice of the French Fifth Republic. The Constitution of October 4, 1958 adopted a model of strengthened political power of the head of state, granting them instruments of executive influence on the functioning of other state organs. Paragraph 12 of the Constitution gives the President practically unlimited power to dissolve the National Assembly – the lower chamber of French parliament. The conditions for applying this paragraph are not stipulated in the legal regulations. It is not necessary for the President to respond to a motion of another body, or even to obtain a countersignature. These constitutional factors have led to various political practices. The author of the paper puts forward the thesis that giving freedom to the head of state as regards the application of paragraph 12 on the one hand provides the necessary foundations <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> model with a considerable degree of decisiveness, but on the other may lead to a situation where {{the dissolution of the}} National Assembly no longer has a power function in its conventional sense, but serves the purpose of providing the head of state with an instrument for considerably strengthening his own political position. Since the present Constitution of the Fifth Republic has been in force, the National Assembly has been dissolved five times. The author identifies three basic grounds for applying paragraph 12 : to defuse a political or social conflict (1962 and 1968), to restore a politically homogenous executive power (1981 and 1988), and to maintain a given political configuration (1997). Since the 1980 s the dissolution of parliament has become a tool for the president to avoid cohabitation and, by this token, to provide a political system where the role of the leader of the executive {{is in the hands of}} the head of state. On account of the defeat of the formation supporting the president in 1997 this strategy failed to produce the expected outcome. The dissolution of the National Assembly has not taken place since. In 2000, the length of the mandate of the head of state was shortened to five years, which makes it more likely for parliamentary elections to occur directly after presidential elections. This may for a long time to come eliminate the main grounds for the dissolution of the lower chamber, which in the 1980 s and 1990 s stemmed from the desire to ensure a political system favorable for the head of state. This reason alone may mean that the significance of paragraph 12 in the political practice of the Fifth Republic will continue to be limited...|$|E

60|$|Except on this occasion, {{the captain}} talked with Randolph chiefly of his later past,--of voyages he had made, of places they were passing, and ports they visited.

Randolph sometimes wondered how he would treat a crew of his own.

In Re Hay's ST, Megarry VC said that: [...] <b>A</b> mere <b>power</b> is very different an ordinary trust obligation. Normally the trustee is not bound <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> it, and the court will not compel him to do so. That, however, {{does not mean that}} he can simply fold his hands and ignore it, for normally he must from time to time consider whether or not <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> the power, and the court may direct him to do this. The holder of <b>a</b> mere <b>power</b> is therefore free to do what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails <b>to</b> consider his <b>exercise</b> of the power, the courts may force him to do so.
