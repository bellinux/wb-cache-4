40|$|The {{biological}} action of bamboo/wood vinegars collected at different temperatures from the exit of chimney of earthen kiln was evaluated by Salmonella mutagenesis assay, {{as a safety}} evaluation (Ames test) and reverse mutation assay (antimutagenic activity). The compounds of <b>the</b> <b>vinegars</b> were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy analysis. The acid, phenol and ketone compounds of bamboo vinegars were 10. 65 – 20. 09 %, 57. 87 – 65. 98 % and 10. 13 – 18. 76 %, and the compounds of wood vinegars were 4. 27 – 14. 51 %, 50. 23 – 65. 03 % and 12. 93 – 25. 26 %, respectively. The vinegars’ safety showed that neither cytotoxicity nor mutagenicity toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100 with S 9 mix (an external metabolic activation system) at the diluting percent content of vinegars were lower than 20. 00 % or less, and without the S 9 mix was at 33. 33 % or less. <b>The</b> <b>vinegars</b> at a diluting percent content below 20. 00 % expressed a dose–dependent inhibitory effect against both 4 –nitroquinoline–N–oxide (NQNO), a direct mutagen, and the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), an indirect mutagen which requires metabolic activation, in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. The inhibition of <b>the</b> <b>vinegars</b> against NQNO and AFB 1 toward TA 100 was better than those toward TA 98. In addition, the main percent of phenol and ketone compounds in <b>the</b> <b>vinegars</b> showed cytotoxicity/mutagenicity and an antimutagenic effect against the strains mentioned above, which may partially account for the {{biological action}} of bamboo/wood vinegars...|$|R

2500|$|Walker was well-regarded as a {{proficient}} {{business man}} whom can be noted for {{being involved in}} a wide range of different businesses and industries. Some associate his success with his ability to dabble in multiple business opportunities as well as jump quickly on prospective businesses. This can be seen, for example, during his grocery business between 1849 and 1858 when Walker had the idea to produce his own vinegar. His beginnings in the distillery business have been traced to January 1849, where an advertisement in a Detroit newspaper publicized Walker's [...] "barrels of cider vinegar" [...] and [...] "wheat whisky". It was advertised for 10 cents per gallon. [...] Through this business, he began to distill his own vinegar, which became popular in the area because of its consistency, low price, and high quality. He then sold it at his grocery store, to other grocers as well as across the River in Windsor via door-to-door sales. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>vinegar</b> factory became another successful business venture for Walker which, after years of success in Detroit, he sold in 1858.|$|E

Antifungal activities of vinegars were evaluated using a Petri dish bioassay with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 % (v/v) against a white-rot fungus, Trametes versicolor, and a brown-rot fungus, Fomitopsis palustris. Antitermite activities were tested using a no-choice bioassay method for Coptotermes formosanus with 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 % (v/v). All <b>the</b> wood <b>vinegars</b> exhibited antifungal activities against T. versicolor. In particular, <b>the</b> wood <b>vinegar</b> produced at 350  °C resulted in complete inhibition of T. versicolor growth at 1.0 and 1.5 %.

All <b>the</b> wood <b>vinegars</b> exhibited antitermite activity to C. formosanus workers in the no-choice experiment at relatively high concentrations. For instance, 10 % concentration was required to achieve 100 % mortality against C. formosanus at all production temperatures.

A previous study suggested that phenolic compounds derived from lignocellulosic biomass might be primarily responsible for the antifungal performance of wood vinegars [11].

All wood vinegars exhibited antifungal activity against both fungi. Wood vinegar of 450  °C had the higher activity than those of 400 and 350  °C.
