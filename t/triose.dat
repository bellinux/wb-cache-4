The lactic acid yield from microcrystalline cellulose and several lignocellulose-based raw biomasses is 460 % at 463 K. Both theoretical and experimental studies suggest that lead(II) in combi-nation with water catalyses a series of cascading steps for lactic acid formation, including the isomerization of glucose formed via the hydrolysis of cellulose into fructose, the selective cleavage of the C 3 –C 4 bond of fructose to <b>trioses</b> and the selective conversion of <b>trioses</b> into lactic acid...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of cellulose or cellulose-derived carbohydrates into platform chemicals {{is the key}} to establish biomass-based sustainable chemical processes. The systems able to catalyze the conversion of cellulose into key chemicals in water without the consumption of hydrogen are limited. We report that simple vanadyl (VO 2 +) cations catalyze the conversions of cellulose and its monomer, glucose, into lactic acid and formic acid in water. We have discovered an interesting shift of the major product from formic acid to lactic acid on switching the reaction atmosphere from oxygen to nitrogen. Our studies suggest that VO 2 + catalyzes the isomerization of glucose to fructose, the retro-aldol fragmentation of fructose to two <b>trioses,</b> and the isomerization of <b>trioses,</b> which leads to the formation of lactic acid under anaerobic conditions. The oxidative cleavage of C=C bonds in the intermediates caused by the redox conversion of VO 2 +/VO 2 + under aerobic conditions results in formic acid and CO 2. We demonstrate that the addition of an alcohol suppresses the formation of CO 2 and enhances the formic acid yield significantly to 70 - 75 %. Two birds with one stone: A shift of the major product from formic acid to lactic acid is observed on switching the reaction atmosphere from O 2 to N 2 during cellulose or glucose conversions catalyzed by vanadyl cations. Glucose is first isomerized into fructose, which undergoes retro-aldol fragmentation to form two <b>trioses,</b> which produce lactic and formic acid. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

50|$|Although the {{metabolism}} of fructose and glucose {{share many}} of the same intermediate structures, they have very different metabolic fates in human metabolism. Fructose is metabolized almost completely in the liver in humans, and is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis, while much of dietary glucose passes through the liver and goes to skeletal muscle, where it is metabolized to CO2, H2O and ATP, and to fat cells where it is metabolized primarily to glycerol phosphate for triglyceride synthesis as well as energy production. The products of fructose metabolism are liver glycogen and de novo lipogenesis of fatty acids and eventual synthesis of endogenous triglyceride can be divided into two main phases: The first phase is the synthesis of the <b>trioses,</b> dihydroxyacetone(DHAP) and glyceraldehyde; the second phase is the subsequent metabolism of these <b>trioses</b> either in the gluconeogenic pathway for glycogen replenishment and/or the complete metabolism in the fructolytic pathway to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle, is converted to citrate and subsequently directed toward de novo synthesis of the free fatty acid palmitate.|$|R
40|$|The direct {{conversion}} of C 3 sugars (or <b>trioses)</b> to alkyl lactates was achieved using zeolite catalysts. This reaction represents a key step towards the efficient conversion of bio-glycerol or formaldehyde to added-value chemicals such as lactate derivatives.

Correlating the types and amounts of acid sites present in the different zeolites reveals that two acid functions are required to achieve excellent catalysis. Brønsted acid sites catalyse the conversion of <b>trioses</b> to the reaction intermediate pyruvic aldehyde, while Lewis acid sites further assist in the intramolecular rearrangement of the aldehyde into the desired lactate ester product. The presence of strong zeolitic Brønsted acid sites should be avoided {{as much as possible}} since they convert the intermediate pyruvic aldehyde into alkyl acetals instead of lactate esters.

40|$|The role of calmodulin in insulin {{secretion}} from rat pancreatic islets {{has been}} {{examined by the}} use of trifluoperazine, an inhibitor of calmodulin-Ca++-directed functions. It was found that 30 microM trifluoperazine caused 50 % inhibition, and 100 microM, up to 73 % inhibition of 16. 7 mM glucose-stimulated insulin release. 100 microM trifluoperazine caused a similar inhibition of 10 mM glyceraldehyde-stimulated release. Therefore, the site of action of trifluoperazine in glucose stimulus-secretion coupling appears to be after the <b>trioses.</b> As trifluoperazine had no effect upon insulin release stimulated by 1 mM 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, the inhibitory effect of trifluoperazine appears to be rather specific. Further, the process of exocytosis per se is not affected. It was also found that although trifluoperazine inhibited the effect of glucose to stimulate insulin release, it did not affect the synergism between glucose and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine to potentiate insulin release. It may be concluded that trifluoperazine selectively inhibits one part of the mechanism by which glucose stimulates insulin release.

40|$|The direct {{conversion}} of <b>trioses</b> (dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde) to lactates represents {{an important step}} towards the conversion of biomass derived glycerol to added value products [1]. A set of zeolites Y with various Si/Al ratios and different degree of dealumination were tested as catalysts for this reaction. Ultrastable zeolites Y (USY) with low Si/Al ratio displayed the highest yield and selectivity towards the desired alkyl lactate and could be reused in various successive cycles without loss of activity [2]. The study was further developed by exploring the conversion of <b>trioses</b> with aluminium and gallium oxides and {{with a series of}} substituted mesoporous MCM- 41 materials, presenting different amount and type of acid sites. Gallium oxide showed good catalytic activity and an improved selectivity towards the lactate product compared to the USY zeolites. This study highlighted the importance of the type and strength of the acid sites of the catalyst in determining the yield and the selectivity of the reaction. A combination of mild Brønsted acidity and of Lewis acidity is proposed to be the most suitable for catalysing the formation of alkyl lactates.
