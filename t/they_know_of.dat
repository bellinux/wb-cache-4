25|$|Heuristics are {{cognitive}} short cuts. Instead of weighing all {{the evidence}} when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of.</b> Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias {{is a type of}} bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.|$|E
25|$|China {{is one of}} Israel's closest {{economic}} {{allies in}} East Asia where both countries have placed considerable importance on maintaining a strategic and supportive economic relationship. The economic synergy has served the two respective countries greatly where Israel's global technological prowess combined with China's global economic influence, industrial manufacturing capabilities, and marketing expertise made cooperation {{between the two nations}} inevitable. China including Hong Kong is Israel's second top export destination after the United States and has been the top market for Israeli exports in East Asia. China is also Israel’s third largest trading partner and export market after the United States and the European Union with China being Israel's largest export market in East Asia. Israel has sought China's enormous global influence on world affairs, large consumer market, broad industrial manufacturing scale, and burgeoning economic dynamism while China has sought Israel as a powerhouse of advanced technological wizardry and a wellspring of entrepreneurial acumen leveraging each other's complementary capabilities and resources. China has sought Israel's technology to increase its international economic competitiveness and risk management. With the advice and experience of Jewish entrepreneurs, innovators, and inventors from the high-technology sectors, China has utilized Israel's indispensable economic and technological contributions to foster its long term economic development. China has also expressed desire for Israel’s advanced technologies, particularly in fields related to agriculture, telecommunications, and defense. The scientific and technological advancements made by Israel had led many Chinese politicians to respect the country's ingenuity and creative inventiveness because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the contributions that as Israeli agricultural, drip irrigation, and solar energy technologies are seen as crucial to China’s economic development. Throughout Israel's early economic history, many Israeli startup companies were acquired by major U.S. and Western European corporations. Since the 2010s, China and Israel enhanced bilateral economic ties with China connecting both Chinese and Israeli businessmen and investors to invest in each other's economies respectively. Chinese economic cooperation with Israel has saw substantial Chinese investment of more than $15 billion USD in the Israeli economy, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel's know how to help the invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China now ranks second after the United States in collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel’s Office of the Chief Scientist. Major Chinese firms such as Fosun, ChemChina, Brightfood, Horizons Ventures and China Everbright have invested significant amounts of financial capital and resources across numerous Israeli industries. Chinese businessmen and major Chinese corporations hold Israel's business, economic and entrepreneurial acumen and technological expertise with high esteem and have sought to integrate Israel's know-how with China's marketing proficiency, industrial manufacturing capacity and aptitude for large consumer market scaling.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond a Boundary (1963) is {{a memoir}} on cricket {{written by the}} Trinidadian Marxist {{intellectual}} C. L. R. James, which he described as [...] "neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography". It mixes social commentary, particularly on the place of cricket in the West Indies and England, with commentary on the game, arguing that what happened inside the [...] "Boundary Line" [...] in cricket affected life beyond it, {{as well as the}} converse. The book is in a sense a response to a Rudyard Kipling quote from the poem [...] "English Flag": [...] "What should <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> England who only England know?", which James in his Preface revised to: [...] "What do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> cricket who only cricket know?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The book's key question, {{frequently}} {{quoted by}} modern journalists and essayists, {{is inspired by}} a line in Rudyard Kipling's poem [...] "English Flag" [...] – [...] "What do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> England who only England know?". James asks in the Preface: [...] "What do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> cricket who only cricket know?" [...] Acknowledging that [...] "To answer involves ideas as well as facts", James uses this challenge {{as the basis for}} describing cricket in an historical and social context, the strong influence cricket had on his life, and how it meshed with his role in politics and his understanding of issues of class and race. The literary quality of the writing attracts cricketers of all political views.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attempt to}} assassinate Vladimir Lenin and depose the Bolshevik Government is {{considered}} by biographers to be Reilly's most daring scheme. The Lockhart Plot, or more accurately the Reilly Plot, has sparked debate over the years: Did the Allies launch a clandestine operation to overthrow the Bolsheviks and if so, did the Cheka uncover the plot at the eleventh hour or did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the conspiracy from the outset? Some historians {{have suggested that the}} Cheka orchestrated the conspiracy from beginning to end and that Reilly may have been a Bolshevik agent provocateur.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 August 2006 Hezbollah {{launched}} its fiercest barrage, firing more than 200 rockets into Israel. On the same day, Mahmoud Qomati, the deputy head of Hezbollah's political bureau, said that [...] "Our missile capacity is still untouched. It is sufficient at two levels, in quantity for the missiles <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of,</b> and in quality for those they still don't know about [...] the type or the range." [...] He added: [...] "We have enough missiles for months." [...] A Khaibar-1 hit {{the town of}} Beit Shean, , south of the Lebanese border and the deepest hit of the rocket campaign to date. This was despite attempts by IDF to move Hezbollah forces north of the Litani. [...] Israeli police released the figure of 160 rocket attacks by 7am killing one Israeli on a bicycle near the border town of Nahariya. [...] Rockets hit the cities of Tiberias, Maalot, Kiryat Shemona, Carmiel, Rosh Pina and Safed. By 1800hrs Lebanese time 190 rockets were reportedly fired. By 2030 hrs Lebanon time this figure had reportedly risen to 220 rockets. [...] Iranian News Agency FARS reported a total of 300 rocket attacks striking fifteen areas inside Israel.|$|E
2500|$|From {{this same}} evidence, {{something}} {{can be seen}} of Saint Patrick's mission. He writes that he [...] "baptised thousands of people". He ordained priests to lead the new Christian communities. He converted wealthy women, some of whom became nuns {{in the face of}} family opposition. He also dealt with the sons of kings, converting them too. The Confessio is generally vague about the details of his work in Ireland, though giving some specific instances. This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the chiefly elite. He does claim of the Irish: Never before did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. The sons and daughters {{of the leaders of the}} Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!Saint Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity. Legally he was without protection, and he says that he was on one occasion beaten, robbed of all he had, and put in chains, perhaps awaiting execution. Patrick says that he was also [...] "many years later" [...] a captive for 60 days, without giving details.|$|E
