50|$|In the United States, {{southern}} magnolia, {{along with}} sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) and cucumbertree (Magnolia acuminata), is commercially harvested. Lumber {{from all three}} species is simply called magnolia, which {{is used in the}} construction of furniture, <b>boxes,</b> <b>pallets,</b> venetian blinds, sashes, and doors and used as veneers. Southern magnolia has yellowish-white sapwood and light to dark brown heartwood tinted yellow or green. The usually straight-grained wood has uniform texture with closely spaced rings. The wood is ranked moderate in heaviness, hardness, and stiffness, and moderately low in shrinkage, bending, and compression strength; it is ranked moderately high in shock resistance. Its use in the Southeastern United States has been supplanted by the availability of harder woods.|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{competitive}} environment has forced companies to rethink {{and come up}} with strategies for cost minimization. Logistics accounts for {{a significant part of the}} total costs in a manufacturing company, thus leaving room for major reductions through re-engineering of logistics processes. In logistics, packaging has become an important focus area where there are opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with logistics. Furthermore, pallet configurations have always been an area of concern for various industries. Packing <b>boxes</b> onto <b>pallets,</b> i. e. palletization, consists of arranging different products that are packed in <b>boxes</b> onto <b>pallets</b> in the most efficient way. An efficient palletization system has many advantages such as cost reduction of transportation and inventory, reduced loading and unloading operation times, and facilitation of freight handling. A minor increase in the number of products loaded on the pallet may lead to significant savings. The purpose of this study has been to assess and evaluate McNeil AB’s packaging system focusing mainly on the pallet configurations and the impact these have on various logistical activities. McNeil AB, a Johnson & Johnson company, is a world leading organization in smoking cessation products, with the Nicorette brand recognized globally. The Nicorette products come in different forms, such as gums, inhalers, lozenges and nasal sprays. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the <b>boxes</b> and the <b>pallet</b> configurations of the company have been reviewed and analyzed from a packaging logistics point of view. The analysis has resulted in a set of modified <b>boxes</b> and <b>pallet</b> reconfigurations to improve efficiency. In fact, eight boxes have been modified and given new dimensions based on the optimal pallet configuration. Also, of the total 52 pallet configurations that exist within the company, 36 have been modified with either new layers, modified <b>boxes</b> or modified <b>pallet</b> configuration. These new modified pallet configurations do not only result in an improved external filling rate but also in pallet loads that are more secure and stable. The reconfigurations have led to the fact that the external filling rate of the pallet loads has improved by 24, 5 %, going from an average external filling rate of 66, 5 % to 82, 8 %. To evaluate the impact of the changes that have been made, a cost analysis has been carried out to determine the savings of the proposed modifications. The cost analysis has been based on transportation, warehousing and pallet costs. With the proposed modified <b>boxes</b> and <b>pallet</b> reconfigurations, annual savings of approximately 1 MSEK can be achieved. Other benefits with the proposed <b>boxes</b> and <b>pallet</b> configurations are increased product safety, less pallets to handle and lower environmental impact, all of which lead to a more efficient logistics flow.

40|$|AbstractThe {{order picking}} {{activities}} in distribution center are mainly sorting and arrangement works classified by destinations {{in accordance with}} customer's request. The activities consist of lifting, moving, picking, putting, packing and other works basically. Also it can be classified into box picking, client picking, etc. according {{to the shape of}} products, type of process, type of picking system and so forth. In some companies, picking process consists of pre-picking and auto picking. Pre-picking refers to the work before the auto picking system classification where orders received from clients are checked and products are sorted by unit of <b>box,</b> <b>pallet</b> or auto picking unit. The auto picking (or semi auto picking) is defined as the process of sorting the pre-picking-treated products according to the units of clients, order, vehicles, etc. through the auto picking system. Although these activities are very simple and easy, every warehouse has different process for picking {{due to the lack of}} standard process. In this paper, we present a standard picking process for light weight cargo & productivity analysis for warehouse picking systems considering operational processes to compare: standard process versus ad-hoc process; conventional manual picking (e. g. manual digital picking system) versus automatic picking system...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationship between interhandle distances and upper limb exertion during simply pushing and pulling of a cart with four swivel wheels, defined by a roll <b>box</b> <b>pallet</b> (RBP) in a Japanese industrial standard. Methods: Six healthy young male participants were asked to push and pull an RBP at a distance of 5. 2  m under six conditions corresponding to different interhandle distances (40  cm, 60  cm, and 80  cm) and weights (130  kg and 250  kg). The upper limb exertion was studied by shoulder abduction and flexion, and elbow flexion, as well as surface electromyogram (EMG) in shoulder extensor, and elbow flexor and extensor. Participants were required to provide subjective evaluations on operability after each trial. Results: Subjective operability indicated that a narrower interhandle distance had a better operability for pushing. Interhandle distance was also related to upper limb exertion especially for pushing. A narrow interhandle distance caused smaller shoulder adduction but larger elbow flexion. The normalized EMG data revealed that muscular activity became smaller with a narrow interhandle distance in shoulder extensor. During the pulling task, elbow flexion was smaller at a narrow interhandle distance, although subjective operability and normalized EMG were not significantly varied. Conclusion: A wider interhandle distance, such as 80  cm, was not suitable in the forwardbackward movement of the RBP. Therefore, this study concluded that an interhandle distance of 40  cm would be suitable for pushing and pulling an RBP to protect the workers' hands against the risk of injury by installing inner handles...|$|R

5000|$|... "Knowledge {{lives in}} lots of {{different}} forms over time," [...] Kahle has said. [...] "First it was in people's memories, then it was in manuscripts, then printed books, then microfilm, CD-ROMS, now on the digital internet. Each one of these generations is very important." [...] Voicing a strong reaction {{to the idea of}} books simply being thrown away, and inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Kahle envisions collecting one copy of every book ever published. [...] "We're not going to get there, but that's our goal," [...] he said. [...] "We want to see books live forever." [...] Pointing out that even digital books have a physical home on a hard drive somewhere, he sees saving the physical artifacts of information storage as a way to hedge against the uncertainty of the future. (Alongside the books, Kahle plans to store the Internet Archive's old servers, which were replaced in 2010.) He began by having conventional shipping containers modified as climate-controlled storage units. Each container can hold about 40,000 volumes, the size of a branch library. So far, Kahle has gathered about 500,000 books. He thinks the warehouse itself is large enough to hold about a million titles, with each one given a barcode that identifies the cardboard <b>box,</b> <b>pallet</b> and shipping container in which it resides. A given book may be retrieved in about an hour, and are not to be loaned out but used to verify contents recorded in another medium.Book preservation experts say he'll have to contend with vermin and about a century's worth of books printed on wood pulp paper that decays over time because of its own acidity.
