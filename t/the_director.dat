5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s.

5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under <b>the</b> <b>director</b> officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from <b>the</b> <b>director</b> to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I, and the most important development was <b>the</b> <b>director</b> firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. <b>The</b> <b>director</b> layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.
