25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishop's {{complaints}} is surprising, as Chetwynd {{was often}} guilty of {{much worse than}} financial ineptitude. It seems that he maintained an armed retinue {{and he was not}} afraid to use it. In 1316 Vivian de Staundon robbed a royal official who was carrying a large sum of money to Ireland on behalf of Edward II Chetwynd, together with John Ipstones, a local baron, raised a large force of armed men to prevent Staundon's arrest and then sheltered him from justice, absorbing him into their own retinues. Warrants were issued for the arrest of both of them but, although Ipstones was apprehended, Chetwynd escaped and went to ground, evading several attempts to bring him to court, and the matter seems to have lapsed. In 1321 he again evaded justice by the simple expedient of not answering the summons, when the king prosecuted him for falsely claiming immunity from tolls and harbour dues in London. Despite his criminal history, when he retired in 1330, Chetwynd was allowed the revenues of two manors, Blackfordby and Freasley, and of two churches, as well as his food, fuel, candles, two horses, a capacious lodging at the abbey and hospitality for his guests. Even this was not enough for him: the disgruntled ex-abbot seized the abbey by force and pillaged it. The matter was only resolved when Edward III sent in keepers to restore order. This marked a low point in the reputation of the abbey.|$|E

Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails.

500|$|The {{importance}} that the anti-apartheid movement among South African exiles {{increased in the}} late 1970s, driven partly by the activities of Mayibuye. The Amandla Cultural Ensemble drew together among militant ANC activities living in Angola and elsewhere in this period, influenced by Mayibuye, {{as well as the}} World Black Festival of Arts and Culture that was held in Nigeria in 1977. As with Mayibuye, the group tried to use their performances to raise awareness and generate support for the ANC; however, they relied chiefly on new material composed by their own members, such as Jonas Gwangwa. Popular songs performed by the group were selected for or adapted to a militaristic and faster tone and tempo; at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groups performance tended to be more affirmative, and less antagonistic and sarcastic, than that of Mayibuye. Members often struggled to balance their commitments to the ensemble with their military activities, which were often seen as their primary job; some, such as Nomkhosi Mini, daughter of Vuyisile Mini, were killed in military action while they were performing with Amandla. Such artists also faced pressure to use their performance solely {{in the service of the}} political movement, without monetary reward. Amandla had carefully crafted performances of music and theater, with a much larger ensemble than Mayibuye, which included a jazz band. The influence of these groups would last beyond the 1970s: a [...] "Culture and Resistance" [...] conference was held in Botswana in 1982, and the ANC established a [...] "Department of Arts and Culture" [...] in 1985.|$|E

[...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", something that is not synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to <b>the</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, medium close ups, and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|E

500|$|This already {{applied at}} the top: the {{constitution}} contained an age-requirement {{for the members}} of the Uitvoerend Bewind, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented [...] "young Turks" [...] that were appointed Agents, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel. <b>The</b> <b>tenor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: Amstel (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), Texel (the northern peninsula) and Delf (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel, and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain [...] "national unity" [...] through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes, {{got in the way of}} the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.|$|E
