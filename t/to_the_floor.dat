Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped {{in front of}} the train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's shoebox, which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E
5|$|After the hearing, Jones {{allegedly}} spat in {{the face}} of his son's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, and supposedly pushed her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying he would never get into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off {{the flow of blood}} to the brain.

Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E

5|$|Crewkerne Grammar School was {{situated}} at DeCombe House, until it {{closed in the}} late 1960s, before the Grammar school was combined into St Martins School of Abbey Street. St Martins used to be situated in the High Street, until it moved to its current position in the late 1970s. The Senior and Juniors School section closed in 2003, and now serves as a pre-school nursery only.

50|$|The Quay and Derby Street {{elevations}} have a three-storeyed recessed arch with expressed keystone to each bay.

5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie Olivier. The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's ground game. In the stand-up, Mann was regarded as being unusually tentative, which gave Olivier {{the opportunity to take}} him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> where again, neither fighter was able to advance position or do anything of note. After three rounds, Olivier was declared the winner via unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on {{the west and the}} Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly flat and fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E

When she heard the gunfire, she grabbed the children and pushed them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and MalcolmX's associates used a stretcher to carry him up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{then held}} an impromptu Ten-Man Gauntlet match to {{determine}} Kevin Nash's replacement {{in the main}} event. This was the ninth match of the show {{with a duration of}} 14 minutes and 12 seconds. The participants for the match were Abyss, A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, Kip James, Lance Hoyt, Monty Brown, Rhino, Ron Killings, Sabu, and Samoa Joe. The rules for a Gauntlet match are as follows: two wrestlers start the match with another entering at 2 minute intervals. The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope and down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest. The last two wrestlers were Abyss and Rhino. Rhino won the match after lifting Abyss over the top rope and down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

Before he can, Jeff gets dizzy, his vision blurs, and he falls <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match at}} Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty-man Gauntlet match, {{consisting}} of wrestlers who compete in TNA's X Division. In this particular match, wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown {{over the top}} rope and down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> until there were two left in the ring. Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit. The final two participants were Kazarian and Héctor Garza. Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle, but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll-up for the win.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
