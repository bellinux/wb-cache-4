2500|$|The Sb.1 was {{designed}} by two engineering students from the Technische Universität München (Technical University of Munich), Ernst von Lößl/Loessl, (cousin of Eugen von Loessl killed at the Wasserkuppe on 9 August 1920) and Albert Finsterwalder. It was built by them {{with the assistance of}} the Munich branch of the Bayern Gliding Club during the winter of 1920-21. They were aware of the high-wing monoplane gliders that had been under development by Friedrich Harth, assisted by the teenage Willy Messerschmitt, since before 1915. By about 1920 Harth was convinced that long glider flights depended on energy capture from gusts (ridge and <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> was undiscovered) and the Harth-Messerschmitt designs were controlled in pitch by a variable angle of incidence wing and roll by wing warping. Its pilot had two levers, one for roll and the other for pitch. The tailplane was fixed. Lößl and Finsterwalder took these ideas a stage further by making the wings separately rotatable and controlled with a conventional column, which when moved sideways rotated the wings in opposite directions. [...] The fixed tailplane was retained but the conventional fin and rudder of the Harth-Messerschmitt was entirely removed; instead, yaw was controlled by the opening above and below the wing of little wing tip trailing edge double split flap airbrakes. This last feature did not work well so the brakes were replaced by a conventional, rectangular rudder; this was further modified later by adding a triangular tip, forming a balanced rudder. At the same time a fixed fin was added.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>lift</b> {{is often}} used by birds, such as raptors, {{vultures}} and storks. Although <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> was known to the Wright Brothers in 1901, it was not exploited by humans until 1921 by William Leusch at the Wasserkuppe in Germany. It was not until about 1930 {{that the use of}} thermals for soaring in gliders became commonplace.|$|E

50|$|Eagle Rock’s rock-pillar crown rises as a steep {{backdrop}} {{behind the}} Heller Ranch. The Golden Eagle, {{along with the}} hawks, circles upon <b>thermal</b> <b>lifts</b> where sunshine warms the southerly rock faces. The Heller’s spread is being restored in establishing the Heller Center for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs.|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} {{flight was}} performed by a motorglider equipped with an aerosol size spectrometer and nano-particle counter over a large area in the rural vicinity of Budapest, Hungary. The flight {{was carried out in}} the early afternoon under unstable air dynamical conditions in August 2010. These conditions allowed flying in glider mode, with the engine switched off, using <b>thermal</b> <b>lifts</b> for altitude gain. A significant part of the flight was spent in thermals that allow studying how the atmospheric dynamics acts on the particle formation. It was found that hygroscopic growth affects the particle size distribution in the 30 – 500 nm interval. In the 30 – 280 nm interval, the growth rate was found to be similar to that of ammonium sulphate particles. Indirect signs of cloud droplet formation were found during cloud cross, as a concentration drop in size bins fallen in the 280 – 400 nm size range. In three <b>thermal</b> <b>lifts</b> significantly higher ultrafine particle concentration (30 &lt; d &lt; 280 nm) was measured, with decreased average diameter. The results support the supposition that convective eddies in the boundary layer affect the aerosol composition via hygroscopic growth and secondary particle formation...|$|R
5000|$|Like other Ciani designs, the Spillo {{was built}} by Sezioni Sperimentale di Volo a Vela (SSVV), an {{offshoot}} of the Aeroclub Volovelistio Milanese. It first flew in 1954. In 1958 the wing trailing edge was modified, chiefly by the addition of camber changing plain flaps inboard of the ailerons which added low speed, <b>thermalling</b> <b>lift</b> as well as slowing landing approach speed. They could extend from +5° to −90°. [...] At the same time the aileron span was increased by 11% and the wing area by 3.5%; the weight also increased slightly. In 350 hours of flying the undercarriage had twice been damaged in fast landings onto bumpy ground, so the skid was reinforced.|$|R
50|$|The Ballerina {{was capable}} of using both ridge and <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> Pilots could use it to gain their C badge.|$|E
5000|$|... 1971. Dave Kilbourne foot-launches and soars on {{ridge and}} <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> (1 hour) at Mission Peak, California, US. This {{seems to be}} the first foot-launch of a {{flexible}} wing not using skis.|$|E
50|$|Sailplanes are flown using <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> As {{thermals}} {{can only}} be indirectly observed through {{the reaction of the}} aircraft to the invisible rising air currents, skill is required to find and stay in the thermals.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} also popular with glider pilots, who often fly long {{distances}} from <b>thermal</b> and ridge <b>lift</b> near the mountains.|$|R
50|$|Soaring {{animals and}} {{aircraft}} may alternate glides with periods of soaring in rising air. Five principal types of <b>lift</b> are used: <b>thermals,</b> ridge <b>lift,</b> lee waves, convergences and dynamic soaring. Dynamic soaring is used predominately by birds, and some model aircraft, {{though it has}} also been achieved on rare occasions by piloted aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Soaring: gliding in rising or {{otherwise}} moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air {{is due to}} <b>thermals,</b> ridge <b>lift</b> or other meteorological features. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.|$|R
50|$|The ULF 1 {{was first}} flown in November 1977 and first {{shown at the}} 3rd International Hang Glider Meet at the Wasserkuppe in August 1978. The {{prototype}} was built by Reich's partner at EEL, Heiner Neumann. The design {{was intended to be}} able to soar in weak ridge and <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nanolights are {{somewhat}} slower than purpose-built microlights. Because {{they are so}} light, they are often used for thermal soaring. The engine is used to launch the aircraft to a safe altitude and to find a thermal. It is then turned off and the pilot uses <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> alone to gain altitude.|$|E
50|$|Crystal Airport is {{primarily}} a Glider-port, {{that is home to}} the Southern California Soaring Academy, a glider school and FBO at the airport. Its proximity to the San Gabriel Mountains makes it a popular soaring location because of excellent ridge lift, and <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> from its location in the high desert of California. It is located approximately 30 nm from Edwards Air Force Base, and the school has been previously contracted to train Air Force pilots how to fly gliders.|$|E
2500|$|Soaring birds can {{maintain}} flight without wing flapping, using rising air currents. Many gliding birds {{are able to}} [...] "lock" [...] their extended wings {{by means of a}} specialized tendon. [...] Soaring birds may alternate glides with periods of soaring in rising air.

50|$|If the air {{is rising}} faster than the object is descending, it will be carried upwards. In this way a gliding object can gain {{additional}} potential energy from sources such as <b>thermals</b> and ridge <b>lift.</b>|$|R
50|$|Based on a {{fuselage}} of the SZD-8 Jaskółka, the SZD-11 Albatros {{was designed}} to investigate the performance of aircraft during flight in <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> The main designer was Justyn Sandauer, and the main constructor was J. Niespał. With wings of greater span, and reduced empty weight, the wing loading was reduced, markedly improving the climb performance over the 16m-span SZD-8 Jaskółka. Three more SZD-11 aircraft were planned with fixed trailing edges and no flaps, but only the prototype was completed. The SZD-11 first flew on 14 September 1954, flown by Tadeusz Góra.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1950s, regular glider {{records were}} set out of Inyokern in various sources of lift. Due to its {{location}} on the lee side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, it is an excellent location for altitude records in wave conditions or distance and speed records in <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> It is a challenging location, as the winds change frequently, but with three long runways pilots generally {{have a variety of}} options for launch and landing. Many well known pilots have flown gliders out of Inyokern, including Neil Armstrong, Paul Bikle, and Steve Fossett.|$|E
50|$|Red locusts are {{sedentary}} when ample shelter, perches {{and food}} is available. In dry years, when {{the amount of}} suitable habitat is reduced population densities increase. If the population density increases past a threshold, the locusts will transform into their gregarious phase, changing their behaviour and anatomy. When gregarious, red locusts keep together in large swarms and fly with the wind in daylight hours, looking for more food. The higher temperatures during daylight enable gregarious locusts to travel longer distances by flying longer and higher, aided by <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> A swarm will rarely move more than 20-30 km in a day.In contrast, solitary locusts prefer to fly {{in the dark and}} do so alone.|$|E
5000|$|Once launched, {{sailplanes}} try to gain height using <b>thermals,</b> ridge <b>lift,</b> lee waves or convergence {{zones and}} can remain airborne for hours. This {{is known as}} [...] "soaring". By finding lift sufficiently often, experienced pilots fly cross-country, often on pre-declared tasks of hundreds of kilometers, usually {{back to the original}} launch site. Cross-country flying and aerobatics are the two forms of competitive gliding. For information about the forces in gliding flight, see lift-to-drag ratio.|$|R
50|$|Day 1: {{very late}} and {{handicapped}} start (4pm for 400 km, 50min after main competitors, 600m+ lower), from well below allowed altitude due to very weak thermal conditions near airfield. Managed to place 4th flying a good synergy of <b>thermal</b> and ridge <b>lifts</b> {{on the second}} half of the course.|$|R
50|$|Burnout generates high-energy plasma that {{bursts into}} flame {{when exposed to}} oxygen. He can direct his flames into searing thermal energy blasts, or {{surround}} himself with an aura of protective flames to deflect physical attacks. He can superheat the air around him to create powerful <b>thermal</b> updrafts that <b>lift</b> him into the air (allowing him to fly).|$|R
50|$|The {{next level}} is the Pilot badge. The club pilot {{will have to}} show, within a club hill environment, that they have gained {{a certain level of}} skill and ability, and can pass {{examinations}} regarding aviation law among other subjects. The aim of this badge is to allow the club pilot to leave the hill and fly cross-country using <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> For this the pilot needs a higher level of understanding on aviation law and how airspace priority works in order to avoid disruption or danger to mainstream airspace users such as the military, commercial or private airlines, and general aviation pilots. Flying cross country is not approved until the Pilot badge is gained.|$|E
50|$|In early 1928 Professor Walter Georgii, an {{academic}} meteorologist {{and head of}} the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG), began studies of thermals, previously assumed to be too weak to assist gliders. He directed flights of a light, powered aircraft which, with its engine idling, discovered uplifts of several metres per second. At about the same time Alexander Lippisch, who had earlier worked at Dornier on Zeppelins was considering the application of the variometer to gliding. These rapid response rate of climb instruments were known in lighter-than-air craft but had not been used on gliders. The two came together to produce a glider, designed by Lippisch and built at the RRG that had the performance to utilize <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> detected by the variometer. The result was the RRG Professor, first flown in May 1928 and intended by RRG to be built in numbers by clubs under licence, from their plans. The prototype was christened the Rhöngeist (Ghost of the Rhön Mountains) after Lippisch, who had earned this nickname during earlier visits to the Wasserkuppe gliding centre.|$|E
50|$|U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigators}} queried the German Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), Germany's {{equivalent of}} the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the accident history of the Nimbus-4DM {{in conjunction with a}} 1999 accident near Minden, Nevada where both occupants of the aircraft were killed. In this accident, the glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> conditions. Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the accident sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral. With a 45-degree nose-down attitude, the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations. The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near-vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)). The glider was observed to level its attitude, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the outboard wing tip panels separated from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dived into the ground. Several witnesses estimated that the wing deflection reached 45 degrees or more before the wings failed. Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left and right outboard wing sections failed symmetrically at two locations.|$|E
50|$|Thermal soaring uses {{columns of}} warm, rising air called <b>thermals</b> to provide <b>lift</b> for a glider. Thermal soaring gliders are {{normally}} launched with a bungee cord catapult, a winch or towed by a powered model aircraft. A discus launch glider (DLG) is simply launched {{into the air}} with a spinning motion much like a discus throw.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as thermals. Soaring pilots quickly become aware of land features which can generate thermals and their trigger points downwind, because thermals have a surface tension with the ground and roll until hitting a trigger point. When the <b>thermal</b> <b>lifts,</b> the first indicator are the swooping birds feeding on the insects being carried aloft, or dust devils or a change in wind direction as the air is pulled in below the thermal. As the thermal climbs, bigger soaring birds indicate the thermal. The thermal rises until it either forms into a cumulus cloud or hits an inversion layer, {{which is where the}} surrounding air is becoming warmer with height, and stops the thermal developing into a cloud. Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a cloud street, thermals can line up with the wind, creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a cloud street to fly long straight-line distances by remaining in the row of rising air.|$|R
25|$|Sandhill cranes' large wingspans, {{typically}} , {{make them}} very skilled soaring birds, similar in style to hawks and eagles. Using <b>thermals</b> to obtain <b>lift,</b> {{they can stay}} aloft for many hours, requiring only occasional flapping of their wings and consequently expending little energy. Migratory flocks contain hundreds of birds, and can create clear outlines of the normally invisible rising columns of air (thermals) they ride.|$|R

40|$|One {{method of}} {{improving}} flight endurance for UAVs {{is to take}} advantage of <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> occurring in convective boundary layers of the atmosphere. This paper investigates the possible benefits of using a cooperating team of small UAVs to increase the probability of finding <b>thermal</b> <b>lift.</b> An algorithm that employs a team of two autonomous gliders was developed, simulated and initially flight tested. Probability studies suggest that a cooperative approach increases the chance of finding lift to a significant extent. Due to the unpredictable nature of thermals, simulation results need to be complemented with further flight testing to determine the effectiveness of this approach.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe use of {{atmospheric}} updrafts as an energy source for long endurance flight {{has proven to}} be extremely advantageous for birds, remote control sailplanes, and manned soaring vehicles. Recent research conducted by Michael Allen at NASA and Dr. Dan Edwards at North Carolina State University has demonstrated the viability of using a UAV to search for, detect, and gain altitude using thermal updrafts. This approach can be taken a step further by introducing multiple cooperating vehicles to reduce the time spent searching for <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> while simultaneously increasing the time spent in <b>thermal</b> <b>lift</b> gaining altitude and/or saving fuel. UAV missions calling for multiple vehicles can use this approach to reduce the demand for on board energy storage by using environmental energy more effectively than a vehicle flying alone. This research aims to complement existing autonomous soaring efforts by developing a low cost thermal soaring system that is capable of working with single or multiple cooperating vehicles to find and utilize thermal updrafts. Early simulations developed to validate this idea have given rise to further analysis and experimentation with two custom airframes, each equipped with instruments to detect updrafts and autonomous capabilities to test cooperative soaring algorithms in the real world. The system developed used a sub $ 1000 commercial off-the-shelf autopilot and custom ground control software to achieve many autonomous soaring flights with a single vehicle. Several flights with two autonomous vehicles were also performed and cooperative behavior was demonstrated...|$|E
5000|$|Human beings, unlike {{birds and}} other flying animals, {{are not able}} {{directly}} to sense climb and sink rates. Before {{the invention of the}} variometer, sailplane pilots found it very hard to soar. Although they could readily detect abrupt changes in vertical speed ("in the seat of the pants"), their senses did not allow them to distinguish lift from sink, or strong lift from weak lift. The actual climb/sink rate could not even be guessed at, unless there was some clear fixed visual reference nearby. Being near a fixed reference means being near to a hillside, or to the ground. Except when hill-soaring (exploiting the lift close to the up-wind side of a hill), these are generally very unprofitable positions for glider pilots to be in. The most useful forms of <b>lift</b> (<b>thermal</b> and wave <b>lift)</b> are found at higher altitudes and it is very hard for a pilot to detect or exploit them without the use of a variometer. After the variometer was invented in 1929 by Alexander Lippisch and Robert Kronfeld, the sport of gliding moved into a new realm.|$|R
50|$|Powered gliders have {{recently}} seen {{an increase in}} popularity. By combining the efficient wing size and wide speed envelope of a glider airframe with an electric motor, {{it is possible to}} achieve long flight times and high carrying capacity, as well as glide in any suitable location regardless of <b>thermals</b> or <b>lift.</b> A common method of maximising flight duration is to quickly fly a powered glider upwards to a chosen altitude and descending in an unpowered glide. Folding propellers which reduce drag (as well as the risk of breaking the propellor) are standard. Powered gliders built with stability in mind and capable of aerobatics, high speed flight and sustained vertical flight are classified as 'Hot-liners'. 'Warm-liners' are powered craft with similar abilities but less extreme thrust capability.|$|R
5000|$|Speed to fly is a {{principle}} used by soaring pilots when flying between sources of <b>lift,</b> usually <b>thermals,</b> ridge <b>lift</b> and wave. The {{aim is to}} maximize the average cross-country speed by optimizing the airspeed in both rising and sinking air. The optimal airspeed is independent of the wind speed, because the fastest average speed achievable through the airmass corresponds to the fastest achievable average groundspeed. [...] The idea is usually attributed to Paul MacCready, although {{an early version of}} the theory was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938.However Späte may not have considered sinking air between thermals, and {{there is no mention of}} this until 1947 when Ernest Dewing and George Pirie independently included this aspect. Paul MacCready, however, certainly invented the [...] "ring", which allowed an easy indication of the optimal speed to fly.|$|R
