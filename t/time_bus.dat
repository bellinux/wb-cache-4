50|$|CANaerospace {{sets forth}} {{a concept of}} {{managing}} the available bandwidth of a multi-drop CAN network to ensure predictable behavior for ATM and PTP communication which is called <b>Time</b> Triggered <b>Bus</b> Scheduling. <b>Time</b> Triggered <b>Bus</b> Scheduling {{is based on a}} limitation of the number of CAN messages that any node in the network may transmit within a minor time frame. The minor time frame is defined during initial system design. The maximum number of messages transmitted within one minor time frame may differ from node to node and contain growth potential if granted by system design. It is crucial to the <b>Time</b> Triggered <b>Bus</b> Scheduling concept that every node in the network adheres to its transmission schedule at all times when generating network traffic. It is neither required nor prohibited, however, that nodes in the network synchronize to other nodes concerning their message transmission order or transmission times.|$|R
