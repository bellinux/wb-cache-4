40|$|BACKGROUND: To test validity, safety, {{costs and}} healing-outcome of {{surgical}} minitracheotomy after cannula removing. METHODS: Design: Opened, perspective. Site: Polyvalent ICU. Patients: 40 patients underwent surgical minitracheotomy, in a year. Traditional surgical technique was adopted. Minitracheotomy {{was performed by}} intravenous general anesthesia with curarization and in mechanical ventilation. Intra-operative monitoring: ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and SaO 2 by digital pulse oximetry. If a bleeding appeared, hemorrhage was stopped by vessel binding. RESULTS: Technical difficulty was the same in every tracheotomy carried out. Complications appeared in 7 patients. There were 2 infectious cases for stoma, resolved in 7 and 12 days respectively by local disinfection and antibiotic therapy. There were 5 cases with moderate bleeding; in one patient only a surgical procedure was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical tracheotomy represents a good and safe method in ICU; complications are few, if safety conditions are observed. Tracheotomy made in ICU reduced the use of medical and paramedical staff and operative rooms; unlike percutaneous procedure, in the surgical technique an always the same set after simple sterilization is used. Healing-outcome of surgical <b>tracheotomy,</b> after <b>cannula</b> removing, is the same with both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Cannulas {{and voice}} {{prostheses}} are mechanical aids {{for patients who}} had to undergo tracheotomy or laryngectomy for different reasons. For {{better understanding of the}} function of those artificial devices, first the indications and particularities of the previous surgical intervention are described {{in the context of this}} review. Despite the established procedure of percutaneous dilatation tracheotomy e. g. in intensive care units, the application of epithelised tracheostomas has its own position, especially when airway obstruction is persistent (e. g. caused by traumata, inflammations, or tumors) and a longer artificial ventilation or special care of the patient are required. In order to keep the airways open after <b>tracheotomy,</b> tracheostomy <b>cannulas</b> of different materials with different functions are available. For each patient the most appropriate type of cannula must be found. Voice prostheses are meanwhile the device of choice for rapid and efficient voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy. Individual sizes and materials allow adaptation of the voice prostheses to the individual anatomical situation of the patients. The combined application of voice prostheses with HME (Head and Moisture Exchanger) allows a good vocal as well as pulmonary rehabilitation. Precondition for efficient voice prosthesis is the observation of certain surgical principles during laryngectomy. The duration of the prosthesis mainly depends on material properties and biofilms, mostly consisting of funguses and bacteries. The quality of voice with valve prosthesis is clearly superior to esophagus prosthesis or electro-laryngeal voice. Whenever possible, tracheostoma valves for free-hand speech should be applied. Physicians taking care of patients with speech prostheses after laryngectomy should know exactly what to do in case the device fails or gets lost...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{compared}} four different sites and {{conditions for the}} measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in 38 spontaneous breathing tracheotomised patients. Of the patients, 28 had {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The four different conditions were: 1) through a cuff inflated cannula (condition A); 2) through the mouth with a deflated cannula (condition B); 3) through the mouth with a phonetic uncuffed cannula (condition C); and 4) through the mouth after stoma closure (condition D). Five trials in each condition were performed using a standardised method. The measurement of both MIP and MEP differed significantly depending on the condition of measurement. MIP taken in condition A was significantly higher when compared with conditions B, C and D. MEP in condition A was significantly higher when compared with condition B and D. In condition A the highest frequency of the best measurement of MIP and MEP was observed at the fourth and fifth effort, respectively. The same results were obtained after the selection of only COPD patients. In conclusion, respiratory muscle assessment differs significantly depending on measurement condition. Measurement through inflated <b>cannula</b> <b>tracheotomy</b> yields higher values of both maximal inspiratory and maximal expiratory pressure...|$|R
40|$|Tracheotomy and ventilator-associated pneumonia: the {{importance}} of oral care To the Editors: We read with interest the recent study of NSEIR et al. [1], which demonstrated that tracheotomy was independently associated with a decreased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The authors offered several potential explanations as to why tracheotomised patients should be at decreased risk of VAP {{compared to patients with}} translaryngeal intubation. These included liberation of the vocal cords, resulting in a reduced risk of aspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions into the lung and the reduction in bacterial biofilm formation associated with regular changing of the <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>cannula,</b> and facilitation of weaning, leading to a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground and objectiveIatrogenic {{tracheal}} injury (ITI) {{is a rare}} yet severe {{complication of}} endotracheal tube (ETT) placement or tracheostomy. ITI is suspected in patients with clinical and/or radiographic signs or inefficient mechanical ventilation (MV) following these procedures. Bronchoscopy is used to establish a definitive diagnosis. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective, single-centre chart review of 35 patients between 2004 and 2014. Depending on the nature and location of ITI and need for MV, patients were triaged to surgical repair, endoscopic management with airway stents or conservative treatment consisting of ETT or <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>cannula</b> (TC) placement distal to the wound and bronchoscopic surveillance. ResultsThree of the four patients (11. 43 %) presenting with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) underwent surgery. Seven patients (20 %) who did not require MV underwent endoscopic surveillance. Of the 24 ventilated patients (68. 57 %), 7 with ITI in the lower trachea were treated with silicone Y-stent (ETT or TC was placed inside the stent) and 17 patients with ITI in the upper trachea were managed by placing ETT or TC cuff distal to the injury. Overall management success, defined as complete healing of the ITI, was seen in 88. 57 % of patients. Four patients (11. 43 %) died of non-ITI-related comorbidities. ConclusionConservative management {{should be considered in}} non-ventilated patients with ITI and when ITI is located in the upper trachea of ventilated patients where ETT or TC bypasses the injury. Airway stenting should be considered in ventilated patients with ITI located in the lower trachea. Surgery should be reserved for TEF and conservative and endoscopic management failure...|$|E
40|$|JUSTIFICATIVA E OBJETIVOS: A press√£o do balonete transmitida diretamente na parede da traqu√©ia de forma {{irregular}} pode ocasionar les√µes e levar a broncoaspira√ß√£o. O objetivo deste estudo foi demonstrar que ao implantar uma rotina de mensura√ß√£o da press√£o do balonete, obt√©m-se controle fidedigno para manter as medidas dentro dos par√¢metros considerados seguros, evitando assim, as complica√ß√µes descritas. M√âTODO: Foram avaliadas 3195 medidas de press√£o de balonete em 1194 pacientes dos sexos masculino e feminino, internados nas unidades de terapia intensiva (UTI) e coronariana (UC), que estavam sob ventila√ß√£o mec√¢nica com uso de pr√≥tese endotraqueal e c√¢nula de traqueostomia, nos per√≠odos matutino e vespertino. RESULTADOS: Durante o per√≠odo de mar√ßo a agosto de 2005 foi realizado acompanhamento das medidas colhidas pelos profissionais de fisioterapia e observou-se que as medidas foram irregulares, em m√©dia, em 80 % dos casos. Diante desse fato foi elaborado um programa de treinamento, com foco nas Equipes de Enfermagem das UTI e UC, que consistiu na orienta√ß√£o dos procedimentos adequados realizados √† beira do leito (treinamento em loco). Os treinamentos foram realizados em dois per√≠odos (matutino e vespertino) para abranger toda a equipe. CONCLUS√ïES: Sugere-se a necessidade da vigil√¢ncia das press√µes do balonete atrav√©s da implanta√ß√£o de uma rotina de mensura√ß√µes matutina, vespertina e noturna, como meio profil√°tico, para prevenir as poss√≠veis complica√ß√µes da press√£o de bal√£o da pr√≥tese traqueal. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The tube cuff pressure directly transmitted on the tracheal wall in {{an irregular}} form can cause injuries {{and lead to}} bronchoaspiration. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate that the implementation of routine tube cuff pressure measurements result in a reliable control to maintain the measurements within the parameters considered safe, thus preventing the described complications. METHODS: A total of 3, 195 tube cuff measurements were obtained from 1, 194 male and female patients admitted at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Coronary Unit (CU), who were undergoing mechanical ventilation with endotracheal prosthesis and <b>tracheotomy</b> <b>cannula,</b> during the morning and afternoon periods. RESULTS: From March to August 2005 the follow-up of the measurements obtained by the physical therapy professionals was carried out and it was observed that the measurements were irregular, on average, in 80 % of the cases. Thus, a training program was established, which was focused on the Nursing Teams of the ICU and CU, consisting in providing directions for the adequate procedures performed at the bedside (in loco training). The training procedures were carried out at two different periods (morning and afternoon) in order to include the whole team. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that it is necessary to monitor tube cuff pressure through the implementation of routine measurements in the morning, afternoon and evening periods as a prophylactic measure, in order to prevent the possible complications of tracheal prosthesis balloon pressure...|$|E
