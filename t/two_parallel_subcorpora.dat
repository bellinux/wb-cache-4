40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the ongoing discussion on treebank annotation schemes and their impact on PCFG parsing results. We provide a thorough comparison of two German treebanks: the TIGER treebank and the TüBa-D/Z. We use simple statistics on sentence length and vocabulary size, and more refined methods such as perplexity and its correlation with PCFG parsing results, as well as a Principal Components Analysis. Finally we present a qualitative evaluation of a set of 100 sentences from the TüBa- D/Z, manually annotated in the TIGER {{as well as in the}} TüBa-D/Z annotation scheme, and show that even the existence of a <b>parallel</b> <b>subcorpus</b> does not support a straightforward and easy comparison of both annotation schemes...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the translator's fingerprints as manifested in his/her style in translation. It reports {{a case study of}} two Chinese translations of Ulysses, adopting a corpus-based approach. The <b>parallel</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of the self-built Bilingual Corpus of Ulysses (BCU) consist of Joyce's Ulysses and its two Chinese versions produced by Xiao (1994 Tran. Ulysses, Nanjing: Yilin Press) and Jin (1997 Tran. Ulysses, Beijing: People's Literature Publishing House), respectively, and the comparable subcorpora include Xiao's original writings in Chinese. The comparison of the keyword lists shows that Xiao, the literary writer and translator, leaves some traces of lexical idiosyncrasy in his composition and translation. On the syntactic level the comparison reveals that due to the interference of the English language Xiao post-positions more adverbial clauses in translation than in composition, a feature that distinguishes the translated text from non-translated original writing. This indicates that the fingerprints of the translator are left on the translated text both as a result of his/her linguistic idiosyncrasy and of the interference and constraints of the languages s/he is dealing with in translation...|$|R

50|$|By scaling the {{resulting}} map, <b>two</b> <b>parallels</b> {{can be assigned}} unit scale, with scale decreasing between the <b>two</b> <b>parallels</b> and increasing outside them. This gives the map <b>two</b> standard <b>parallels.</b> In this way, deviation from unit scale can be minimized within a region of interest that lies largely between the <b>two</b> standard <b>parallels.</b> Unlike other conic projections, no true secant form of the projection exists because using a secant cone does not yield the same scale along both standard parallels.|$|R
