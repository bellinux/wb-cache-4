500|$|The {{following}} two days saw a massive refugee column {{of cars and}} trucks [...] "laden with bundles... bumper to bumper" [...] trudging through the intersection. Melkonian ordered his forces to halt their advance until {{the remnants of the}} column dried up in the early afternoon of April 1. Assessing that most refugees had left, he ordered his units to advance and sent a detachment to guard a vital tunnel leading south towards Zulfugarli. While his troops had assumed that most civilians had left Kelbajar, they encountered a GAZ-52 <b>transport</b> <b>truck</b> in the tunnel and, thinking it was a military vehicle, fired and destroyed it with rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles. As they observed the wreck of the vehicle, the troops realized they had taken out a vehicle filled entirely with civilians: twenty-five Kurd and Azeri kolkhoz workers. Four of them, including the driver of the truck and his daughter, were killed. The rest were ordered by Melkonian to be taken to a hospital in Karabakh's capital of Stepanakert; however, as many as eleven of them died.|$|E

That famous stunt in Stagecoach was filmed near Chimney Rock on Rabbit Dry Lake, west of Lucerne Valley, California. He first did it in Riders of the Dawn in 1937 while doubling for Jack Randall. In his 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, Steven Spielberg paid homage to Canutt, recreating the stunt when stuntman Terry Leonard (doubling for Harrison Ford) 'dropped' {{from the front of}} a German <b>transport</b> <b>truck,</b> was dragged underneath (along a prepared trench) and then climbed up the back and round to the front again.|$|E
