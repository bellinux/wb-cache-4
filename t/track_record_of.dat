5|$|On {{his way to}} a still-standing <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment {{faster than}} the one before it. The {{successive}} quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2014, Sporting Clube de Portugal {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Gauld from Dundee United, for an undisclosed fee rumoured {{to be in the}} region of £3 million. He signed a six-year contract with a €60 million buy-out clause. He credited Sporting's <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> developing players such as Luís Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani for his decision to join them. Despite being put into the club's B-team, Gauld was named in the 25-man squad to play in the UEFA Champions League after impressing manager Marco Silva during training sessions.|$|E
5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> producing political films.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October. Gibbs cited his <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> passing {{legislation}} and his connections and experience {{at the state capitol}} as part of his case for re-election, and named wildfire and business concerns as his major priorities for a continued term in the Colorado Senate. He also called for reducing business personal property taxes and growing local small businesses. Gibbs' re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Summit Daily News, and the Boulder Daily Camera, the Arvada Press, and the Golden Transcript. Gibbs raised over $100,000 during his campaign to Ytterberg's $60,000, and ultimately won re-election with about 59 percent of the vote, taking three-quarters of votes cast in Summit County, but losing narrowly to Ytterberg in suburban Jefferson County.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> never {{missing a}} floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer {{was able to}} slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness {{that makes it difficult}} to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{the race}} was disputed. The infield teletimer {{displayed}} a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54, but two Daily Racing Form clockers claimed the time was 1:53, which would have broken the <b>track</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> 1:54 set by Cañonero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got {{to the finish line}} first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker's 1:54 as the official time; however, the Daily Racing Form, {{for the first time in}} history, printed its own clocking of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{describe}} the uncovering of a corporate brand's core values and implications for strategic management <b>of</b> its <b>track</b> <b>record.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the specific <b>track</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> Volvo, IKEA, IBM, and Scanpump, focusing on core values and how they evolve. Based on multiple sources <b>of</b> evidence, the <b>track</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> the case companies emerge as patterns of values that are: perceived externally by customers and non-customer stakeholders; and rooted internally within an organisation. Findings - Four categories of core values emerge, termed true, aspirational, potential, and hollow. Originality/value - The Core Value Grid is proposed as a managerially useful model on "how to build true values and avoid hollow values". In principle, a corporate brand cannot be stronger externally than it is internally. Rooted core values with <b>track</b> <b>records</b> supporting a brand promise represent {{the essence of a}} corporate brand, guiding internal and external corporate brand building and management. The foundation of a corporate brand risks being undermined by hollow core values and empty promises...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the Caribbean. It {{argues that}} the reason they have lagged is fundamentally explained by factors internal to the MFIs, rather than external to them. The paper introduces four Caribbean MFIs, two with <b>track</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> low loan delinquency rates and two with <b>track</b> <b>records</b> <b>of</b> high loan delinquency rates, and analyzes their lending methodology. The paper concludes that Caribbean MFIs can become profitable, successful financial institutions by making changes to their internal policies and procedures. This is a very empowering conclusion, for it says that Caribbean MFIs need not wait {{for someone else to}} remedy external difficulties. They can be successful by changing their own practices. The second half of the paper goes on to analyze the kinds of changes that are needed for Caribbean MFIs to become successful.
