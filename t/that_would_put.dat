5|$|In Week 10, the Colts {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh, {{who had the}} league's highest ranked defense. They trailed 17–7 {{in the second quarter}} before Manning found tight end Dallas Clark for a two-yard touchdown to end the half 17–14. Down 20–17 in the 4th quarter, Manning found running back Dominic Rhodes uncovered for a 17-yard touchdown pass <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the Colts up 24–20 {{for the rest of the}} game. It was Manning's fourth game-winning drive (35th of his career) of the season. He completed 21 of 40 for 240 yards and three touchdowns (the 50th game of his career with 3+ touchdown passes). It was the first time the Colts have won in Pittsburgh since 1968 (12 straight losses before this win). Against Houston, Manning passed for 320 yards and two touchdowns while leading five consecutive scoring drives in a 33–27 victory, the third in a row for the Colts. Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season (18th time, career).|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim {{comprehensive}} agreement with the Writers Guild of America <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>put</b> writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company's development. On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy {{to explain why he}} was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E
