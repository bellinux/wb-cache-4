5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>off</b> the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

Since the 440Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour, many chart recorders may use this tone <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>off</b> each hour of the day, and likewise, the omission of the 440Hz tone once per day can be used <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>off</b> each twenty-four-hour period.

5000|$|Michael Scriven further {{developed}} the Beardsley-Thomas approach in his 1976 book Reasoning. Whereas Beardsley had said [...] "At first, write out the statements...after a little practice, refer to the statements by number alone" [...] Scriven advocated clarifying {{the meaning of the}} statements, listing them and then using a tree diagram with numbers to display the structure. Missing premises (unstated assumptions) were to be included and indicated with an alphabetical letter instead of a number <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> them <b>off</b> from the explicit statements. Scriven introduced counterarguments in his diagrams, which Toulmin had defined as rebuttal. This also enabled the diagramming of [...] "balance of consideration" [...] arguments.|$|R
2500|$|The Books of the Bible, {{according}} to its Preface, uses characteristics such as [...] "changes in topic, movement in place or time, or shifts from one kind of writing to another" [...] to identify the natural literary divisions within biblical books. It also relies on the tendency of authors to repeat [...] "particular phrases… each time they [...] the transition from one section to another." [...] The placement of these phrases [...] "reinforces a structure that can already be recognized implicitly from other characteristics." [...] The Books of the Bible uses line spacing of different widths <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>off</b> natural literary sections on various levels.

2500|$|Kant articulates {{his strongest}} {{criticisms of the}} {{organization}} and practices of religious organizations to those that encourage {{what he sees as}} a religion of counterfeit service to God. Among the major targets of his criticism are external ritual, superstition and a hierarchical church order. He sees all of these as efforts to make oneself pleasing to God in ways other than conscientious adherence to the principle of moral rightness in choosing one's actions. The severity of Kant's criticisms on these matters, along with his rejection of the possibility of theoretical proofs for the existence of God and his philosophical re-interpretation of some basic Christian doctrines, allow interpretations that see Kant as thoroughly hostile to religion in general and Christianity in particular (e.g., Walsh 1967). Nevertheless, other interpreters consider that Kant was trying <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>off</b> a defensible rational core of Christian belief. Kant sees in Jesus Christ the affirmation of a [...] "pure moral disposition of the heart" [...] that [...] "can make man well-pleasing to God".|$|E

Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months most children demonstrate avoidance behaviours. Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the {{reflection in the mirror}} as their own and by 20 to 24 months self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try <b>to</b> wipe the <b>mark</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|In short, {{violence}} in labor troubles {{is a unique}} characteristic of no kind of unionism, but is a general and apparently inevitable incident {{of the rise of}} the working class to consciousness and power in capitalistic society.Secondly, revolutionary unionism is not <b>to</b> be <b>marked</b> <b>off</b> from other kinds of unionism by its employment of sabotage as an offensive and defensive weapon. It is true that sabotage is a weapon whose use is highly characteristic of revolutionary unionism, but the notion that its use is confined to revolutionary unionists fades out the moment its true character and varied forms are known. It is moreover distinctly repudiated by many revolutionary unionists, is not confined to revolutionary unions, and, it might be added, is not confined to workers alone.|$|R
