40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many benefits, e. g., unnecessary trauma and blood loss can be minimized by opening tiny surgery scars, recovery process of patients can be lessened, and the possibilities of complications can be decreased. Although robots are widely used in MIS due to their fundamental superiorities such as high precision, current surgery robots mainly suffer from absence/limitation of haptic feedback during operation. This paper proposes a novel electrohydraulic haptic transmission system to improve the haptic feedback of a surgery robot. This new device replaces the highly nonlinear mechanical friction of <b>thrust</b> <b>wire</b> by viscous friction and avoids the backlash due to the incompressibility of fluid. Moreover, since the fluid is constantly occupying the entire volume of the hydraulic tube, the system behavior during bending of the tube can be modeled much easier than the <b>thrust</b> <b>wire,</b> for which position, shape, and bending angles of the inner wire inside the outer tube are hardly predictable. The validity of the proposal and its superiorities over conventional transmission mechanisms, such as <b>thrust</b> <b>wire,</b> are experimentally verified...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique method {{to cancel the}} backlash present in geared drive systems and thrust-wire systems. Large-sized robots need larger actuators with a high inertia to obtain the desired amount of torque. However, the use of large actuators will increase the effect of gravity. To compensate for the gravitational effect, motors with a high torque are again necessary. Therefore, geared drive systems are used to obtain higher torques and decrease the actuator size. However, adding gears will create a backlash problem. Moreover, when {{it is necessary to}} make lighter robots, thrust wires can be used to transmit the motion from the motor to the end effector while keeping them separated. However, the mechanical backlash inside the <b>thrust</b> <b>wire</b> is again a matter of concern. If geared systems and thrust-wire systems are used for the transmission of haptic information in bilaterally controlled systems, the backlash will greatly deteriorate the performance of the system and necessitate compensation. Therefore, a novel method is proposed to uniquely cancel the backlash in the gears and thrust wires used in bilateral teleoperation with twist control. This method uses two identical counter-operating drives per joint to compensate for the backlash effect with a unique control structure {{that can be used in}} both geared systems and thrust-wire systems. Experiments have been carried out for the proposed method to validate its accuracy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{study on}} the incidence, {{intensity}} and management of bark eating caterpillar Indarbela sp. revealed that in low hills of Himachal Pradesh the incidence varied between 91. 5 and 98. 0 per cent in citrus, litchi, mango and guava orchards with litchi as the most preferred host (with caterpillar incidence index value of 3. 95). In mid hills, the incidence ranged between 90. 0 - 94. 5 per cent in plum, apricot and pear orchards. Based on the index of caterpillar incidence value, plum was the most preferred host (6. 67). In high hills the incidence of pest was negligible (0. 0 - 7. 0 %). The poorly managed orchards of mango and citrus were more prone to attack with an incidence of 88 and 92 per cent in comparison to 20 and 24 per cent in well managed orchards, respectively. Young orchards were less prone to bark eating caterpillar infestation with an incidence of 16 and 20 per cent in comparison to 88 and 80 per cent in old orchards of mango and citrus, respectively. Among different management practices evaluated in plum orchards, <b>thrusting</b> of flexible <b>wire</b> plus plugging the hole with mud; <b>thrusting</b> of <b>wire</b> plus pouring of methyl parathion (0. 1 %) in bore hole with syringe and plugging with mud, and <b>thrusting</b> of <b>wire</b> plus pouring of DDVP (0. 15 %) and plugging with mud proved very effective (90 - 100 % control) in managing the pest...|$|R
40|$|Low speed {{wind tunnel}} data have been {{acquired}} for planar panels {{covered by a}} uniform, glow-discharge surface plasma in atmospheric pressure air known as the One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma (OAUGDP). Streamwise and spanwise arrays of flush, plasma-generating surface electrodes have been studied in laminar, transitional, and fully turbulent boundary layer flow. Plasma between symmetric streamwise electrode strips caused large increases in panel drag, whereas asymmetric spanwise electrode configurations produced a significant <b>thrust.</b> Smoke <b>wire</b> flow visualization and mean velocity diagnostics show {{the primary cause of}} the phenomena to be a combination of mass transport and vortical structures induced by strong paraelectric ElectroHydroDynamic (EHD) body forces on the flow...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) {{can be an}} {{underwater}} robot. A simple ROV has been developed that can be built by grade-school children using off-the-shelf and off-the-Internet parts. PVC pipe {{is used for the}} frame, bilge pump motors for <b>thrust,</b> and speaker <b>wire</b> transfers power and control information from the switch box to the robot. Soldering is not required. Once constructed, these ROVs are safely powered by 12 v car batteries and are small enough to be run inside a 30 gallon trash can or small pool. Parts for the ROV kit can be purchased for under $ 125 (sans camera and lights). A detailed ROV build manual is available from doug. levin@noaa. gov. The program is an effective delivery tool that links marine science with a host of other, related disciplines. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} exploding a wire via electromagnetic induction, with a preference for obtaining restrike of the exploding wire in a ring shape or otherwise. Literature on both exploding wire and electromagnetic induction are introduced together. A mathematical framework to describe the wire explosion by induction is formulated from first principles using the idea of magnetic flux linkages. The {{environment in which the}} experiments took place is described, with reference to matters of laboratory safety and also measurement of transient electrical current and voltage in the wire explosion by induction. The results describe the approaches taken to explode a wire by induction to obtain a plasma conductor. Voltage and current data are displayed and described. Throughout this work, there are long-exposure digital photographic images of the experiments taking place. These contribute to determining the outcome of experiments, and support the conclusions. Wires were exploded by induction in an air-cored mutually coupled coils system, and restrike of those wires was achieved. Electrical characteristics of wire explosion by electromagnetic induction are displayed and discussed based on what is known about straight exploding wires. Future works involving creation of plasma rings, electromagnetic <b>thrust</b> and exploding <b>wires</b> in vacuum are discussed...|$|R
