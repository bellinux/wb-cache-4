5|$|Raymond had a {{quick start}} to {{his second season}} in 2008–09, scoring 10 points in his first 13 games, but <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> to add just 13 points for the {{remainder}} of the campaign. Midway through the season, he was named to the 2009 YoungStars Game in Montreal, helping the sophomores beat the rookie team 9–5. He finished his second NHL season with 11 goals and 12 assists in 72 games. In the ensuing 2009 playoffs, where the Canucks entered as the third seed in the Western Conference, Raymond scored his first NHL post-season goal in game three of the second round against the Chicago Blackhawks, a 3–1 win for the Canucks. Vancouver went on to be eliminated by the Blackhawks in six games. Raymond finished with two goals and an assist in 10 post-season contests.|$|E
5|$|Tickets to {{the game}} sold quickly at first, but <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> as the game approached. Virginia Tech sold 5,000 tickets {{in the first three}} days after the Hokies were selected, but one week later, Tech managed to {{increase}} that total to just 8,300. In an effort to spur sales at the school, Virginia Tech athletic director Jim Weaver asked fans to buy tickets even if they did not plan on attending the game. The tickets could then be donated to charity. As an incentive for Gator Bowl officials to select Virginia Tech, the school agreed to sell 18,000 tickets—more than the minimum 11,500 North Carolina agreed to sell. When a shortfall resulted in Tech selling just 11,000 tickets, the school was forced to purchase the remaining 7,000, costing Virginia Tech $245,000. At North Carolina, tickets sales were even slower, with about 6,000 having been sold through the school two weeks after the matchup was announced. The Gator Bowl ticket office sold approximately 22,000 tickets directly to fans in the same timeframe, and Gator Bowl officials predicted a crowd of between 50,000 and 55,000 people at the game.|$|E

In February 2016, Sony Online split H1Z1 into two separate games, the survival mode , and the battle royale-like , around the same time that Greene's consultation period was over.|$|E
25|$|Reported deaths reached 22 in ten {{states by}} July 21, {{the end of}} the first stage of this heat wave. Reports of deaths <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> over the {{week-end}} of July 21–23, though high temperatures persisted and power outages remained in a number of areas including New York, Missouri, and Illinois. In St. Louis, half the city was without power due to severe thunderstorms, prompting requests for volunteer nurses to help cope with the situation. Though temperatures were somewhat cooler, there still was at least one further reported heat death in Missouri.|$|E
25|$|Nurse {{was born}} in Saint Philip Parish, Barbados. Selected in the West Indies under-19s squad for the 2002 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, he {{finished}} as his team's leading wicket-taker (and fifth overall), taking 13 wickets in six matches (including 5/28 against Australia and 3/18 against Scotland). Nurse made his first-class debut just weeks {{after the end of}} the World Cup, playing two Busta Cup matches for West Indies B (a development team). He did not appear at all in top-level domestic cricket during the 2002–03 season, but the following season was a regular for Barbados in four-day matches, and also played in three limited-overs games (in the 2003–04 Red Stripe Bowl). In a four-day match against West Indies B in January 2004, Nurse took 4/19 in the first innings and 7/41 in the second, finishing with career-best figures of 11/60 for the match. His formed <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> over the following two seasons, however, and he never took another first-class five-wicket haul. Nurse's last appearances for Barbados came in February 2008, in the Stanford 20/20 competition.|$|E

500|$|He {{entered the}} 1991 National Football League Draft after his redshirt sophomore season, {{which began with}} him as the nation's leading rusher {{through the end of}} October. The season <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> as Powers got much of the late season {{workload}} with four consecutive 100-yard efforts in Michigan wins. [...] Vaughn was one of a relatively small class of underclassmen, headlined by Ragib [...] "Rocket" [...] Ismail to be approved in the NFL's second class of players allowed to declare themselves eligible for the draft despite remaining amateur eligibility. [...] In addition to Vaughn, other headliners among the underclassmen were Herman Moore, Todd Marinovich and Rob Carpenter (who also played for the 1991 Patriots). [...] John Vaughn was drafted with the first pick of the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. [...] Coach Dick MacPherson used him sparingly from scrimmage in his rookie year as Leonard Russell was the featured back for the 1991 Patriots. [...] However, he had 34kickoff returns, including one touchdown for an average of 21.1yards in 1991. [...] He also completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to Marv Cook against the Houston Oilers on September 22, 1991 in what would be the Patriots only non-quarterback touchdown pass until Dave Meggett repeated the feat during the 1997 NFL season.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{term was}} created in that year– the [...] "Trulli Train". This {{highlighted}} a recurring snag to Trulli's career. It referred to when Trulli qualified in a high position, but dropped away in the races (mainly due to tyre degradation in 2005). The result was the buildup of a queue behind Trulli's car, which was present at numerous races throughout 2005, albeit not in his podium-scoring performances. Team-mate Schumacher tended not to suffer from these problems as much, partly because he often did not qualify as far up the grid as Trulli. He <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> {{towards the end of}} the 2005 season, ending the year behind Ralf Schumacher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} {{initially}} named Holton-le-Clay and Tetney to reflect its location one {{mile to the}} south of the Lincolnshire village of Holton-le-Clay and slightly closer to Tetney to the east. It consisted of staggered platforms either side of the level crossing over the Tetney road; the down platform to the north and the up to the south. A signal box constructed in the standard East Lincolnshire Railway pattern stood {{on the north side of}} the crossing. It controlled the crossing and a small goods yard situated {{to the south of}} the crossing on the down side. The yard was served by a single siding which <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> the down line to end in cattle dock.

2500|$|In {{common with}} Robert Boyle and Jacques Rohault, Huygens adhered {{to what has}} been called, more explicitly, [...] "experimentally {{oriented}} corpuscular-mechanical" [...] natural philosophy. In the analysis of the Scientific Revolution this appears as a mainstream position, at least from the founding of the Royal Society to the emergence of Newton, and was sometimes labelled [...] "Baconian", while not being inductivist or identifying with the views of Francis Bacon in a simple-minded way. After his first visit to England in 1661, when he attended a meeting of the Gresham College group in April and learned directly about Boyle's air pump experiments, Huygens spent time in late 1661 and early 1662 replicating the work. It proved a long process, brought to the surface an experimental issue ("anomalous suspension") and the theoretical issue of horror vacui, and ended in July 1663 as Huygens became a Fellow of the Royal Society. It has been said that Huygens finally accepted Boyle's view of the void, as against the Cartesian denial of it; and also (in Leviathan and the Air Pump) that the replication of results <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> messily.|$|E
2500|$|Pendleton {{made his}} major league debut on July 18, 1984 against the San Francisco Giants. Batting {{sixth in the}} lineup, he made an {{immediate}} impact, getting three hits in 5 at-bats en route to an 8–4 victory for the Cardinals. In 67 games during the 1984 St. Louis Cardinals season, Pendleton had a [...]324 batting average, 20 stolen bases, and finished tied for seventh in Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting. The 1985 St. Louis Cardinals season saw Pendleton remain {{in the starting lineup}} at third base. His batting average <b>trailed</b> <b>off,</b> as he only hit [...]240 for the season and was caught stealing 12 times to go along with 17 stolen bases for the season. The Cardinals advanced to the 1985 World Series, and Pendleton ended up hitting the Cardinals' only triple, doing so in the Cardinals' 3–0 game 4 win. His statline for the 1986 St. Louis Cardinals season was only modestly better. His batting average remained low at [...]239 and he only hit a single home run, but he was able to steal 24 bases, hit 26 doubles and 5 triples. St. Louis management became disappointed with Pendleton after this season, but manager Whitey Herzog pointed out to them that it was his baserunning and fielding (he led the National League in putouts and assists) that made him vital to the team's success.|$|E
