5|$|Corruption was rampant. Deputies awarded {{themselves}} various starostwa {{and other}} privileges. Various fraudulent deals were made that channeled funds intended for government institutions, {{such as the}} Commission of National Education, to <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of the deputies and their allies.|$|E
5|$|The current junior (R10) uniform was {{introduced}} in 1997. In summer, girls are required to wear a Black Watch tunic, short-sleeve white blouse, green blazer with tartan piping, short green socks and black leather shoes. The winter uniform consists of the tunic, long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings. School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are embroidered in red on <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of junior blazers (R10 girls), and white on the left-breast of senior blazers (1112 girls).|$|E
5|$|The {{mining sector}} remains very lucrative, {{with some of}} the world's largest {{platinum}} reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century. They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably, but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of army officers and ZANU-PF politicians.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pocket</b> is {{so named}} because of the village's {{placement}} between the hills. Some hills around <b>The</b> <b>Pocket</b> are as high as 400m. To the west of <b>The</b> <b>Pocket</b> are <b>the</b> Mount Jerusalem ranges which climb to around 700m.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> typical mesh <b>pocket</b> uses 4 main nylon strings {{to affix}} the mesh piece to the head: a topstring, 2 sidewalls, and a bottom string. The topstring is often {{made of a}} {{slightly}} thicker string, in order to resist the abrasive forces that come from scooping the ball up. The sidewalls are used to affix individual mesh diamonds to the sidewall holes on the sidewall of the head. The sidewalls have the most effect on <b>the</b> <b>pocket's</b> performance, as they dictate the placement of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> in <b>the</b> head, the tightness of the channel of <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> and even <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> depth. <b>The</b> bottom string is used to fine-tune <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> depth, and serves to keep the ball from slipping through the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} {{costs for}} the project were discussed. The original estimate was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the cost would be nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real intent was to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June, Hitler, {{through the}} Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Walther von Brauchitsch, {{instructed}} {{the commander of}} Army Group Center Fedor von Bock to halt the advance of his panzers until the infantry formations liquidating <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> catch up. But {{the commander of the}} 2nd Panzer Group Heinz Guderian, with the tacit support of Fedor von Bock and the chief of OKH Franz Halder, ignored the instruction and attacked on eastward towards Bobruisk, albeit reporting the advance as a reconnaissance-in-force. He also personally conducted an aerial inspection of the Minsk-Białystok pocket on 30 June and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to contain it, since Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group was already involved in the Minsk pocket. On the same day, some of the infantry corps of the 9th and 4th Armies, having sufficiently liquidated the Białystok pocket, resumed their march eastward {{to catch up with the}} panzer groups. On 1 July, Fedor von Bock ordered the panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on the morning of 3 July. But Brauchitsch, upholding Hitler's instruction, and Halder, unwillingly going along with it, opposed Bock's order. However, Bock insisted on the order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued. The panzer groups, however, resumed their offensive on 2 July before the infantry formations had sufficiently caught up.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Pacific <b>pocket</b> mice {{all have}} {{different}} characteristics {{ranging from the}} male, female and the baby mice. Since <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mice are members on the Heteromyidae, which consists of animals surviving on seeds and grain, they have fur-lined cheek pouches externally. Most of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse’s body is covered in fur that feels silky. The coats of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mice are spineless and bristle free. The color of <b>the</b> Pacific <b>pocket</b> mouse {{has to do with}} the environment they live in, hence the color of the soil. The dorsal side of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse is usually brown and pinkish while the ventral is usually white. On <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse, there are typically two patches of hairs that are lighter at the base of the ear. The tail of <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> mouse can either be distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy, which are also the distinguishing marks on <b>the</b> Pacific <b>pocket</b> mouse along with the two patches of hair that are lighter at the base of the ear.|$|R
5000|$|Since <b>the</b> Pacific <b>pocket</b> mice are in {{the midst}} of the {{smallest}} subspecies of little pocket mice, they range from 4.25 in to 5.2 in in length from the nose to the tip of the tail.

5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E

50|$|The {{starting}} position {{in this game}} {{is the same as}} in standard chess. Players make moves as in standard chess. Instead of moving, a player can take one of their own pieces from the board and put it into <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> provided that <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> is empty. If the piece is placed into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> from <b>the</b> last rank, it gets promoted to a piece of higher class. Otherwise the player has an option to mutate the piece into a different piece of the same class. The choice of mutating (or not) must be made at the time the piece is removed. White cannot use <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> on <b>the</b> first move. The king cannot be placed into <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One kind of book popularly {{issued in}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> format is <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> {{dictionary}} as an edition of larger dictionaries. A pocket dictionary generally [...] "contains {{no more than}} 75,000 entries", with abbreviated information about each entry, compared to the 170,000 entries or more of a typical desk dictionary, making <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> dictionary inadequate for use by students beyond the high school level. One critic has described <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> dictionary as [...] "almost worthless, except as a flimsy guide to spelling and pronunciation". A countervailing view is that although a pocket dictionary can not replace the desk dictionary, [...] "as a portable learning tool, <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> dictionary is worth its weight in gold".|$|R
