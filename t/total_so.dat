25|$|Since {{heavy water}} is less {{efficient}} at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator to fuel ratio {{and a larger}} core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases the cost for standard features like the containment building. Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are ≈65% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only ≈10% of the <b>total,</b> <b>so</b> the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable. The next-generation Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator.|$|E
