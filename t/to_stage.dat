A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available <b>to</b> <b>stage</b> a festival.

Daley visited Beijing – host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics – on May 15, 2006, where he collected information on hosting.

In the event, his raid failed, and the retreating troops even spread their panic amongst the garrisons of the other forts. It was an inauspicious start for a campaign, and Corbulo severely punished the survivors and their commanders.|$|E

With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{had begun}} by August1926, when several scenes were {{shot in a}} cave that had been {{excavated}} for the production on Karang Hill. Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen <b>to</b> <b>stage</b> directions.

Hostilities resurfaced in 2006 after a new national constitution, which promulgated the division of Katanga into four new provinces, was adopted.|$|E
