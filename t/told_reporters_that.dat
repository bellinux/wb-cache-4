5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E

5|$|Facing the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings in {{the opening}} round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Luongo started {{the first two games}} and played well but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider {{for the rest of the}} series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum, and Luongo {{remained}} on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks' final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011–12. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> he would waive his no-trade clause if management asked him to. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager Mike Gillis' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful due to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} in January 2016 that Sandoval had switched agents {{and was now}} represented by Rick Thurman and Rafa Nieves of Beverly Hills Sports Council.

On April 13, 2016, Sandoval was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder strain. On May 3, 2016, Sandoval underwent surgery on his left shoulder, sidelining him {{for the remainder of the}} season. On September 24, manager John Farrell <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> Sandoval was progressing ahead of schedule in his rehab, and could be an option for the Red Sox in the postseason should a need arise, as the team did acquire Aaron Hill during the season to help with third base depth. Sandoval also made an effort at improving his fitness, losing 15 pounds by August while working at the Red Sox facility in Fort Myers. Due to the injury Sandoval ended his 2016 season with six at bats.|$|E

Afterward, Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip. An MRI revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts, possibly requiring season ending surgery. He was placed back on the 15-day disabled list on August 8. On September 3, 2014, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> Beckett's season was likely over due to his injury.

In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, coach Dan Monson <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye {{was sitting on the}} bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time in}} the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his seventh}} NHL season, Burrows {{received}} his first invite to the Canadian national {{team for the}} 2012 IIHF World Championship, held in Finland and Sweden. Burrows' Vancouver Canucks had been eliminated {{in the first round}} of the 2012 playoffs, making him available for selection. At 31 years old, he was the oldest player on the Canadian roster. Making his Team Canada debut against Slovakia in the first game of the tournament, he fell to the ice and hit his head after colliding with two opposing players. After leaving the ice, he was kept out of the contest with concerns that he had sustained a concussion. The following day, Burrows' agent, Paul Corbeil, <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> while he was symptom free, a return to the line-up would not be possible for four-to-five days, as per team protocol in scenarios in which a concussion is suspected. Returning to the line-up a week after the hit, he scored his first career international goal against Finnish goaltender Kari Lehtonen in a 5–3 win. The following contest, he scored a shorthanded goal in an 8–0 win against Kazakhstan to earn player of the game honours for Canada.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a shame to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E
5|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the 2010–11 season, Edler {{continued}} to improve and was on pace to record new career-highs in goals, assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> Edler had been experiencing tightness in his back at several times in the season, but an open-ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed to his back problems. Edler underwent microdisectomy surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two-and-a-half months, returning for the second-last game of the regular season. Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games, he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring, behind Ehrhoff. His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks. As the Canucks won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time in}} franchise history, the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the team lost the series in seven games. Following their defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries, including Edler, who played Game 7 with two broken fingers. He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) in 25 games.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Kariya {{became a}} {{restricted}} free agent before re-signing with the Ducks to a one-year, $10 million contract in July 2002. Prior to the signing, the Ducks made two key acquisitions, signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one-year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils. Both acquisitions {{were made with}} Kariya's input, {{as well as with}} the expectation they would play on a line with him. Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season (during which time Kariya played with his usual centre, Rucchin), the trio formed the Ducks' top line. Despite playing under a defensive system, implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock, the arrival of Kariya's new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002–03. Several months into the campaign, however, his father died of a heart attack. The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks, which he played nonetheless on December 28, 2002. He recorded an assist in a 7–3 loss. At mid-season, Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All-Star Game, held in February 2003. He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference, as his team beat the East 6–5. While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22-game 1997–98 season, his 56 assists approached a personal best. With 81 points over 82 games, he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time. His efforts helped the Mighty Ducks to the seventh seed in the West, marking the team's return to the playoffs for the first time in four years. Matching up against the second-seeded Red Wings in the first round, Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple-overtime winner in Game 1, resulting in a 2–1 Ducks win. Anaheim went on to sweep the Red Wings in four games; Kariya scored his second goal of the series in the deciding contest, a 3–2 overtime win. It marked the second time in league history that a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four-straight games in the first round. The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey, a contest in which the Ducks faced elimination, Kariya received a hard open-ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens. Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes, he needed to be helped to the dressing room. Many felt Kariya's equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit. Four-and-a-half minutes of playing time later, he returned to the game. Following his return, he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4–1 lead. Anaheim went on to win the game 5–2 to force a Game 7; Kariya finished the contest with a goal and two assists. Reactions regarding Stevens' hit were divided following the game. Kariya <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>that</b> after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow, while Ducks Head Coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit. The play was not penalized during the game, however, and Stevens received no disciplinary measures from the League. Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey, the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3–0 score. Over 21 games, Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring (behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora), scoring six goals and 12 points. Much of Anaheim's success was predicated on goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère's performance, who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. Kariya, meanwhile, was often singled out for his lack of consistent impact throughout the playoffs. As the highest-profile player on the Ducks, he drew matchups against opposing teams top defencemen during the post-season, such as Willie Mitchell against the Wild and Stevens against the Devils. He had also played part of the post-season with a separated shoulder.|$|E
