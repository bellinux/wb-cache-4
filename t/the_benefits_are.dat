5|$|Some {{concerns}} {{have also been}} expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity and land use, as <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only. However, congestion pricing schemes have been used with the main objective of improving urban quality and to preserve historical heritage in the small cities.|$|E
5|$|No {{organisation}} run {{for profit}} {{can be a}} charity; a fee-paying school may be a charitable body despite the fees paid, but not if they are directly run to make a profit, as in Re Girls' Public Day School Trust.

5|$|The {{amount of}} a family’s monthly benefit payment depends on that family's {{specific}} characteristics and financial circumstances, {{as well as}} the overall amount of program funds available for distribution. The latest statistics show that benefits average $103 each month (2003, see table below right). It is the Puerto Rico government's responsibility to establish the eligibility requirements and benefit levels for participation in the program. <b>The</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> revised annually every October 1 to consider the nutritional needs of Puerto Rico's impoverished population, analyze the impact of inflation in Puerto Rico, and plan the distribution of available funds accordingly.|$|E

5000|$|RIB <b>benefits</b> can <b>be</b> {{claimed in}} any {{month after the}} age of 62, subject to certain restrictions. [...] However, <b>benefits</b> may <b>be</b> reduced if they are claimed before that person's Full Retirement Age. For each month that <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> claimed before <b>the</b> month in which the person attains Full Retirement Age, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> reduced by a certain amount of the PIA. For the first 36 months, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> reduced by 5/9 of 1% of the PIA; for {{additional}} months it is reduced by 5/12 of 1%. The aggregate reduction for the first three years is 20%.|$|R

5|$|Tonsillectomy {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

25|$|Timber framing is now {{a modern}} method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house {{building}} as well as public buildings.

Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.|$|E

25|$|Public Part C Medicare Advantage {{health plan}} members {{typically}} usually also pay a monthly premium {{in addition to}} the Medicare Part B premium to cover items not covered by traditional Medicare (Parts A & B), such as the OOP limit, prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, annual physicals, coverage outside the United States, and even gym or health club memberships as well as—and probably most importantly—reduce the 20% co-pays and high deductibles associated with Original Medicare. But in some situations <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> more limited (but they can never be more limited than Original Medicare and must always include an OOP limit) and there is no premium.

25|$|The {{removal of}} a {{bottleneck}} by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as The New Inn at Etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth. The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region. The overall environmental impact is almost certainly negative.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{supports}} {{access to}} water and sanitation in India through financial cooperation by KfW development bank and technical cooperation by GIZ. Since the early 1990s both institutions have supported watershed management in rural Maharashtra, using a participatory approach first piloted by the Social Center in Ahmednagar and that constituted a fundamental break with the previous top-down, technical approach to watershed management that had yielded little results. The involvement of women in decision-making {{is an essential part}} of the project. While <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> mostly in terms of increased agricultural production, the project also increases availability of water resources for rural water supply. In addition, GIZ actively supports the introduction of ecological sanitation concepts in India, including community toilets and decentralised wastewater systems for schools as well as small and medium enterprises. Many of these systems produce biogas from wastewater, provide fertiliser and irrigation water.|$|E

[...] It also eliminates the need for the World War II practice of producing the Military Payment Certificate. [...] The use of a cashless economy at military stores reduces transaction times, freeing personnel from tasks like stamping money orders or counting coins [...] during 9 months of the Iraq War, this saved approximately 5000 hours of processing time for financial personnel. [...] It also prevents counterfeiting.|$|E
500|$|SmarTrip and CharmCard have {{different}} qualifications for inter-system usage, e.g. using CharmCard on non-MTA providers, and using SmarTrip on MTA. Passes and non-cash loads (such as employee transit benefits) are stored {{on the card}} in a separate [...] "purse" [...] from cash loads. Purse benefits can only be used on the issuing system for that benefit, so a day pass issued by MTA on either a CharmCard or SmarTrip will only be valid on MTA, and a WMATA-issued monthly pass will not be valid on MTA {{even if it was}} loaded on a CharmCard. This does mean it is possible to have identical or different passes (like a monthly pass from one and a day pass from the other) from both WMATA and MTA simultaneously loaded on the same card. Monthly transit benefits provided by an employer will only be valid for whichever system the employer is registered with, so an employer who is registered to provide transit benefits with WMATA will only grant benefits usable on WMATA and Washington, DC-area transit providers, even if <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> loaded on a CharmCard. Cash loaded on either card is valid on both WMATA and MTA vehicles. This also means purse funds cannot be used for cash equivalents, so a person who is authorized for a monthly bus pass in employee benefits cannot use that benefit to pay for rail travel or a day pass.|$|E
