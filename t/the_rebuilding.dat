5|$|Rebuilding {{took over}} ten years and was {{supervised}} by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was involved in <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of St Paul's Cathedral and more than fifty London churches. King Charles ll did much to foster <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> work. He was a patron {{of the arts and}} sciences and founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a renaissance in the arts and sciences in England.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>rebuild</b> of Notnäs AB timber sorting line is {{to renew the}} {{existing}} drive and turning ends of the transport chain, which has become old.

50|$|The R11s were rebuilt in 1965 under {{contract}} R34. During <b>the</b> <b>rebuild,</b> <b>the</b> drum brakes were replaced with disk brakes, new fans were installed, {{and the middle}} stanchions were removed to improve passenger flow. <b>The</b> <b>rebuild</b> also included modifications that allowed the cars to operate in consists with other SMEE (contracts R10 through R42) cars.|$|R

5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely around the time of <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Keynes {{continued}} {{to represent the}} United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health.

5|$|Al-Qazdughli, a {{powerful}} Mamluk bey, sponsored several additions and renovations {{in the early}} 18th century. Under his direction, a riwaq for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs, both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.|$|E
5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of the cathedral, as {{evidenced}} by the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Flytoget {{announced}} that they had ordered a fourth car {{for each of the}} units. This increased the capacity of each unit by 40% to 244 seats, and allows the company to manage the annual 10% growth in passengers. The delivery of the fourth cars started in 2008 and were built by Bombardier Transportation, who has bought ADtranz, with <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> scheduled to be completed during 2009. <b>The</b> <b>rebuilding</b> created several challenges for Bombardier, since most of the components used in the class were no longer available. Significant components such as the car body and rectifiers had to be built by Bombardier based on abandoned production lines, and many of the original manufacturers for the interior have become defunct.|$|E
5|$|In 326–328, the empress Helena, consort of {{the emperor}} Constantius Chlorus, and mother {{of the emperor}} Constantine the Great, made a pilgrimage to Syra-Palaestina, {{in the course of}} which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem.

5|$|Two major {{projects}} are being undertaken {{on the southern}} portion of the line: <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of the Cortlandt Street station, and <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of the new South Ferry terminal. Following the September 11 attacks, the Cortlandt Street station was destroyed, and as a result, is being completely rebuilt with a new connection to the World Trade Center PATH station. In 2009, a new station at South Ferry opened to replace the old South Ferry loop station. The new station, a two-terminal, was intended to increase capacity and to save travel times. However, just three years later it closed {{as a result of}} Hurricane Sandy, which completely flooded the station. The loop station was temporarily open to serve the area, but it closed in June 2017 when the newer station reopened.|$|E
5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in {{the wall of the}} Kaaba. A story found in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah Rasul Allah tells how the clans of Mecca renovated the Kaaba following a major fire which had partly destroyed the structure. The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E

5|$|After {{incurring}} {{some damage}} {{during the civil}} war, the federal government launched the Mogadishu Port Rehabilitation Project, an initiative to rebuild, develop and modernize the port. The renovations included the installation of Alpha Logistics technology. A joint international delegation consisting of the Director of the Port of Djibouti and Chinese officials specializing in infrastructure reconstruction concurrently visited the facility in June 2013. According to Mogadishu Port manager Abdullahi Ali Nur, the delegates along with local Somali officials received reports on the port's functions as part of <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> project's planning stages.|$|E
5|$|Again about 1505 <b>the</b> <b>rebuilding</b> of {{the church}} of San Pietro in Oliveto began, a {{commission}} probably won by Sanmicheli. Note that the reliefs are the only figurative works there, in addition to the fine carvings on pilasters and frames of the chapels, a specialism of the Sanmicheli that no longer met contemporary tastes. The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele.|$|E
