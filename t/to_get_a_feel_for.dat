A small farm {{on the outskirts of}} Lancaster, California, stood in for the Wineville chicken ranch. The crew recreated the entire ranch, referencing archive newspaper photographs and visits to the original ranch <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the topography and layout. Steve Lech, president of the Riverside Historical Society, was employed as a consultant and accompanied the crew on its visits.|$|E
500|$|The game's theme song, [...] "Believe in the Spirit", was composed, {{written and}} sung by Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia. Prior to coming on board, she had little {{knowledge}} of the Mana series. As with her previous compositions for video games, Kokia tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the game's atmosphere before starting, either through playing the game directly or looking at behind-the-scenes material related to the game's world. With [...] "Believe in the Spirit", she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team. The track was performed using strings, a tin whistle, an acoustic guitar and percussion. The arrangement was done by Mina Kubota.|$|E

Live action photography began in [...] at Stone Street Studios in Wellington, New Zealand, and {{was scheduled to}} last 31 days. More than a thousand people worked on the production. In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.

500|$|In an interview, Copeland stated his {{creative}} process for writing {{the music for}} the Spyro series always began by playing through the levels, trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> each world's [...] "atmosphere". Copeland noted the challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented the gameplay; his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that the music could seem fresh for players, even after repeated listening. He complimented the compact disc format of the PlayStation and its support for high quality audio; there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing the sound he wanted. Copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when the visuals called for an expansive sound, but used more percussive and beat-driven melodies for [...] "high-energy" [...] moments in the game.|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} entry of the series to be {{directed}} by Duchovny. While Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter, the two agreed that the episode would serve as Duchovny's directorial debut. As the episode did not heavily feature his character, since it is framed as a flashback, Duchovny was {{able to focus on}} pre-production. This narratological method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] enabled him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress of both writing and directing. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results [...] "great." [...] He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even [...] "if [...] just showed up and drooled for 24 hours a day." ...|$|E
500|$|Hall was in New York City and {{thinking}} {{of going back to}} theatre work, and had no intention of returning to television so quickly. However, he changed his mind after reading the script, because he was [...] "intrigued by the macabre mix of dark humor, chilling violence, and a unique central character." [...] He also said that he [...] "realized it was a big commitment and certainly appreciated that coming off of Six Feet Under" [...] but said that he [...] "couldn't pass it up". Lindsay was initially against casting Hall, based on seeing him on Six Feet Under, but after he saw Hall speak one line of the script, Lindsay changed his mind, describing Hall as [...] "absolutely perfect" [...] to portray Dexter. To prepare for the part, Hall read various books on the psychology of serial killers, read transcripts of interviews with serial killers, and spent time with the head blood-spatter analyst at the Miami precinct. He also watched people in New York restaurants <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> {{what it would be like}} to stalk them.|$|E

500|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} a hundred people, over the course of two years. After Call of Duty 2, the Infinity Ward team decided {{to move away from the}} World War II environment of previous games in the series. This resulted in three game concepts: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, [...] and [...] While developing the story for Call of Duty 4, Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current, real-life wars, and keep the series' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength. To enhance the realistic feel of the game, the development team attended a live-fire exercise at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, a training facility in the California desert. This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an Abrams tank when it fires. The team also talked with U.S. Marines who were recently in combat <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the background, emotions, and attitude of Marines in combat. Veterans were also recruited to supervise motion capture sessions and the artificial intelligence design of the game.|$|E
500|$|<b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the era, X-Files {{composer}} Mark Snow {{listened to}} the big band music of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Harry James. The [...] "bouncy instrumental" [...] that plays during the fight scene in the ballroom {{was inspired by a}} similar swing tune composed by John Williams for the 1979 Steven Spielberg film 1941. Snow later joked that his composition was [...] "the third generation of the same inspiration." [...] Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, [...] "I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes." [...] The song that is heard {{near the end of the}} ballroom fight and in the scene featuring Scully and the Lone Gunmen searching for the Queen Anne is a piece of stock music called [...] "Hot Liquorice", composed by Dick Walters. Producer Paul Rabwin oversaw a special arrangement of the 1938 jazz standard [...] "Jeepers Creepers", which was included in the ballroom scene.|$|E
500|$|Lead {{designer}} Fumito Ueda came up {{with the}} concept for Ico in 1997, envisioning a [...] "boy meets girl" [...] story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication. Ueda's original inspiration for Ico was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the manga series Galaxy Express 999 (1977–1981), where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on Kenji Eno's Sega Saturn game Enemy Zero, which influenced the animation work, cinematic cutscenes, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game Another World (Outer World in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any head-up display elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited Sega Mega Drive games, Virtua Fighter, Lemmings, Flashback and the original Prince of Persia games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in Lightwave <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. [...] Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of Shadow of the Colossus, the team's next effort.|$|E

2500|$|Gloster's Chief Test Pilot Bill Waterton flew with Frost in {{the second}} seat; to the test pilot, this was a revelation: [...] "(Frost was)...very much the keen English public schoolboy type.

[...] Frost considered it important <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft and its systems. He even tested the CF-100's ejection seat by becoming a test subject himself. Early flights revealed the great potential of the aircraft but also showed the flaw in the spar was dangerous. With the crash of the second CF-100 prototype and early production CF-100s delivered to the RCAF without the final modifications to the spar, Frost was blamed for the delays and removed as CF-100 Project Designer in early 1952.|$|E
