5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville.

5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to {{be a candidate for}} the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and {{that he did not want}} to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train someone else to run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E

Angry and horrified with himself, Peter stops short of cutting Nathan's head open and teleports {{back to the present}} Level 5, where he enters Sylar's prison cell for an angry confrontation, in which Sylar confirms that he is Peter's brother.|$|R
5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Meg {{is given}} {{a job at a}} local {{convenience}} store. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help Chris get a job there, too.

Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would stand up for her.|$|E

5|$|Stiefel showed Heidemann {{the diary}} in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling {{him it was}} from a plane crash in East Germany, {{although}} he refused to tell the journalist {{the name of his}} source. The collector spoke to Kujau <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Tokyo, Kenshin {{establishes}} lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, {{such as the}} former Shinsengumi member Saitō Hajime. Saitō's arrival is a test ex-Ishin Shishi Ōkubo Toshimichi made in order see Kenshin's power <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can defeat Shishio Makoto. Shishio is the brutal, once-successor to Kenshin's position as Chōshū's hitokiri, masterminds a movement seeking to overthrow the Meiji Government, Kenshin leaves Tokyo to stop him. To defeat such a foe, Kenshin is forced to resume his training and mend {{his relationship with his}} teacher Hiko Seijūrō, who taught and took care of him as a child. He learns the , which deals nine simultaneous strikes to the fundamental targets of swordsmanship. The Kuzu-ryūsen, however, is a by-product used for the initiation in learning his strongest technique: , a battōjutsu that surpasses the speed of the Kuzu-ryūsen. Even if the technique is defeated, it can generate a vacuum in its wake and sucking the opponent in; as this happens, the body is spun around for a second stronger strike. Throughout the training, Kenshin increasingly wants to survive to any combat so that Kaoru will not be shocked by his death. After finishing his training, Kenshin's friends reunite with him and help him defeat Shishio and his army.|$|E
