40|$|Abstract — Our work {{presents}} {{solutions to}} two related vexing problems in feature-based localization of ground <b>targets</b> in <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (UAV) images: (i) A good initial {{guess at the}} pose estimate that would speed up the convergence to the final pose estimate for each image frame in a video sequence; and (ii) Time-bounded estimation {{of the position of}} the ground target. We address both these problems {{within the framework of the}} Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that now has a rich tradition of usage in computer vision and robotics applications. We solve the first of the two problems by frame-to-frame propagation of the computed pose estimates for the purpose of the initializations needed by ICP. The second problem is solved by terminating the iterative estimation process at the expiration of the available time for each image frame. We show that when frame-to-frame homography is factored into the iterative calculations, the accuracy of the position calculated at the time of bailing out of the iterations is nearly always sufficient for the goals of UAV vision.

A popular approach in radar waveform synthesis is the Direct Digital Synthesis approach where the signal is first generated in digital domain and converted into analog signal using a High Speed Digital-to-Analog Converter (HS-DAC). In this paper, a miniature and low cost radar waveform synthesizer is proposed. The synthesizer is <b>targeted</b> for <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (UAV) based radar system applications that require miniaturized equipment due to limited space in aircraft's fuselage. The signal synthesizer has been developed using Altera DE 3 development board (Stratix III FPGA) and a custom made dual-channel 420 MSPS HS-DAC board. The proposed system is capable of generating various types of radar waveforms: a) Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) or chirp pulse, b) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW), and c) Calibration Tone (Cal-Tone), for use in different types of radar applications. The distinguishing feature of the proposed synthesizer is its capability in reconfiguring the signal properties in real-time.

Team performance was measured {{in the context of}} photographing ground <b>targets</b> in an <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicle</b> synthetic task environment. Team process was taken as a measure of team cognition. Experimental results include the findings that team mixing and longer retention intervals have a short lived deleterious effect on team performance immediately after the interval, while team mixing has a positive effect on team process after the interval. These findings suggest that changes in team composition and retention interval can lead to improvements in team cognition if a brief decrement in team performance post-interval can be afforded. These results are interpreted as perturbation of established coordination patterns due to team mixing leading to more flexible and adaptive teams. Implications for process-oriented research are also considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Multi-sensor {{image fusion}} is an {{important}} precondition of realizing <b>target</b> perception for <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> (UAVs), and then UAV can execute various given missions. Imaging devices on UAV are used to capture visual scenes of the ground and they are fused to extract the information. Both the imaging devices setup in the UAV and the target in the ground are in dynamic environment. Due to the imperfection of imaging device and instability of the observed scene, captured images often blurred and exhibit unsatisfactory spatial resolution. Hence single sensor does not fulfil the visual surveillance need in daytime. This paper propose the concept of fusing multi sensor aerial images captured by UAV using YIQ colour model based on Laplacian pyramid transform with Principal component analysis technique. The performance of the proposed image fusion scheme is analyzed using the evaluation metrics of Entropy, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) with the existing techniques...|$|R

Information of texture and color in visible images are abundant, while target information in infrared images is more outstanding.

In this paper, a novel fusion method of airborne infrared and visible image based on target region segmentation and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed, which can gain more target information and preserve more background information. The fusion experiments are done on condition that the target is unmoving and observable both in visible and infrared images, targets are moving and observable both in visible and infrared images, and the target is observable only in an infrared image.

40|$|We study {{throughput}} utility maximization in a multi-user {{network with}} partially observable Markovian chan-nels. Here, instantaneous channel states are unavailable and all controls {{are based on}} partial channel information provided by ACK/NACK feedback from past transmissions. Equivalently, we formulate a restless multi-armed bandit problem in which we seek to maximize concave functions of the time average reward vector. Such problems are generally intractable and in our problem the set of all achievable throughput vectors is unknown. We use an achievable region approach by optimizing the utility functions over a non-trivial reduced throughput region, constructed by randomizing well-designed round robin policies. Using a new ratio MaxWeight rule, we design admission control and channel scheduling policies that stabilize the network with throughput utility that is near-optimal within the reduced throughput region. The ratio MaxWeight rule generalizes existing MaxWeight-type policies for the optimization of frame-based control systems with policy-dependent frame sizes. Our results are applicable to limited channel probing in wireless networks, dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks, and <b>target</b> tracking of <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} maximizing throughput {{utility in}} a multi-user network with partially observable Markov ON/OFF channels. Instantaneous channel states are never known, and all control decisions {{are based on}} information provided by ACK/NACK feedback from past transmissions. This system {{can be viewed as}} a restless multi-armed bandit problem with a concave objective function of the time average reward vector. Such problems are generally intractable. However, we provide an approximate solution by optimizing the concave objective over a non-trivial inner bound on the network performance region, where the inner bound is constructed by randomizing well-designed stationary policies. Using a new frame-based Lyapunov drift argument, we design a policy of admission control and channel selection that stabilizes the network with throughput utility that can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal in the inner performance region.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel stereo-based method for the {{interception}} of a static or moving <b>target,</b> from an <b>Unmanned</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (UAV). This technique is directly applicable for outdoor {{applications such as}} search and rescue, monitoring and surveillance, and complex landing scenarios. Stereo vision is particularly useful for the interception of a moving target as it intrinsically measures the relative position and velocity between the UAV and the person or object. The target position is computed geometrically using its direction, as viewed by the vision system, and the UAV’s stereo height. A Kalman filter computes a reliable estimate of relative position and velocity using the target centroid. The performance of this method is validated by conducting a number of closed-loop interceptions for both static and moving target cases. The mean interception error {{is found to be}} 0. 01 m {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 33 m in tests with static targets and 0. 14 m with a standard deviation of 0. 24 m in tests with moving targets.
