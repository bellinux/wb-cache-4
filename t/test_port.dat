50|$|The {{receivers}} {{make the}} measurements. A network analyzer {{will have one}} or more receivers connected to its test ports. The reference <b>test</b> <b>port</b> is usually labeled R, and the primary test ports are A, B, C,.... Some analyzers will dedicate a separate receiver to each <b>test</b> <b>port,</b> but others share one or two receivers among the ports. The R receiver may be less sensitive than the receivers used on the test ports.|$|E
50|$|For the SNA, the {{receiver}} only measures {{the magnitude of}} the signal. A receiver can be a detector diode that operates at the test frequency. The simplest SNA will have a single <b>test</b> <b>port,</b> but more accurate measurements are made when a reference port is also used. The reference port will compensate for amplitude variations in the test signal at the measurement plane. It is possible to share a single detector and use it for both the reference port and the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> by making two measurement passes.|$|E
50|$|Newer wet nitrous kits on {{domestic}} cars {{have become increasingly}} easy to install by pulling fuel via the schrader valve on the fuel rail, which is normally designated as a fuel <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> It makes plumbing and using a wet nitrous kit much simpler.|$|E
5000|$|SOLT : {{which is}} an acronym for Short, Open, Load, Thru, is the {{simplest}} method. As the name suggests, this requires access to known standards with a short circuit, open circuit, a precision load (usually 50 ohms) and a through connection. It is best if the <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> have {{the same type of}} connector (N, 3,5 mm etc.), but of a different sex, so the through just requires the <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> are connected together. SOLT is suitable for coaxial measurements, where it is possible to obtain the short, open, load and through. The SOLT calibration method is less suitable for waveguide measurements, where it is difficult to obtain an open circuit or a load, or for measurements on non-coaxial test fixtures, where the same problems with finding suitable standards exist.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{architecture}} {{of a network}} analyzer involves a signal generator, a test set, one or more receivers and display. In some setups, these units are distinct instruments. Most VNAs have two <b>test</b> <b>ports,</b> permitting measurement of four S-parameters ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ), but instruments with more than two ports are available commercially.|$|R
50|$|There are {{approximately}} fifteen (15) devices related to backflow which cannot be tested {{as they do}} NOT have isolation valves or <b>test</b> <b>ports</b> {{and there are no}} standards (Test Procedures) set in place to test for any device. This is what sets apart an assembly from a device, an assembly is testable, a device is not.|$|R
50|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{essential}} {{parts of a}} typical 2-port vector network analyzer (VNA). The two ports of the device under test (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The <b>test</b> <b>port</b> connectors provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable connector adaptors A1 and A2 respectively.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the first}} test flight and {{recovery}} of the Orion space vehicle at sea in December 2014, several preparatory vehicle recovery tests were performed. In 2009 during the Constellation phase of the program, the Post-landing Orion Recovery <b>Test</b> (<b>PORT)</b> was designed to determine and evaluate methods of crew rescue {{and what kind of}} motions the astronaut crew could expect after landing. This would include conditions outside the capsule for the recovery team. The evaluation process supported NASA's design of landing recovery operations including equipment, ship and crew needs.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{electrical}} arc forms, gas accumulation is rapid, and oil flows rapidly into the conservator. This flow of oil operates a switch {{attached to a}} vane located {{in the path of}} the moving oil. This switch normally will operate a circuit breaker to isolate the apparatus before the fault causes additional damage. Buchholz relays have a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> to allow the accumulated gas to be withdrawn for testing. Flammable gas found in the relay indicates some internal fault such as overheating or arcing, whereas air found in the relay may only indicate low oil level or a leak.|$|E
50|$|The eight (8) named {{backflow}} assemblies ALL {{have two}} resilient seated isolation/shut off valves with properly located <b>test</b> <b>ports.</b> These assemblies have the distinct {{advantage of being}} in-line serviceable and can be tested & repaired without having to remove an installed assembly. Special accredited courses are given to test & repair backflow assemblies and only certified testers may test backflow assemblies.|$|R
5000|$|TRL(through-reflect-line calibration): This {{technique}} {{is useful for}} microwave, noncoaxial environments such as fixture, wafer probing, or waveguide. TRL uses a transmission line, significantly longer in electrical length than the through line, of known length and impedance as one standard. TRL also requires a high-reflection standard (usually, a short or open) whose impedance {{does not have to}} be well characterized, but it must be electrically the same for both <b>test</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
25|$|A flow bench <b>tests</b> <b>ports</b> under {{a steady}} {{pressure}} difference {{while in the}} actual engine the pressure difference varies widely during the whole cycle. The exact flow conditions existing in the flow bench test exist only fleetingly if at all in an actual running engine. Running engines cause the air to flow in strong waves rather than the steady stream of the flow bench. This acceleration/deceleration of the fuel/air column causes effects not accounted for in flow bench tests.|$|R
5000|$|Latency: {{measures}} the round-trip time {{taken by a}} test frame to travel through a network device or across the network {{and back to the}} <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> Latency is the time interval that begins when the last bit of the input frame reaches the input port and ends when the first bit of the output frame is seen on the output port. It is the time taken by a bit to go through the network and back. Latency variability can be a problem. With protocols like voice over Internet protocol (VoIP), a variable or long latency can cause degradation in voice quality.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to tube and tubeless tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a bleeding and <b>test</b> <b>port</b> on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft.Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content.|$|E
50|$|On November 10, {{an attempt}} to launch a {{biological}} mission (Missile 32E) with a squirrel monkey named Goliath ended in disaster as the Atlas's sustainer engine shut down almost immediately at liftoff, while the verniers failed to start at all. The booster engines managed to retain attitude control until a fire {{broke out in the}} thrust section and caused the B-1 engine to shut down at T+22 seconds. Telemetry data became erratic at this point. The Atlas began tumbling uncontrollably and was destroyed by Range Safety at T+35 seconds, the B-2 engine continuing to operate until missile destruction. The nose cone impacted in the ocean about 20 seconds later. Goliath, who was in a padded container with no restraints, was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean three days later. A postmortem examination of the monkey found that he had died of multiple head injuries probably caused by impact with the ocean rather than separation of the capsule from the booster. Had the flight succeeded, Goliath would have been sent on a 5000-mile (8045 kilometer) suborbital lob and recovered in the South Atlantic. The capsule had no instrumentation or medical monitoring of the monkey, only a TV camera to record his actions during the flight. The sustainer engine was pulled from the ocean floor and examined, which found that a pressure transducer had accidentally been installed on the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> of the LOX regulator. This resulted in near-total LOX starvation of the sustainer engine. Strong vibration in the gas generator from the shutdown ruptured low-pressure ducting and started a propellant leak that led to a thrust section fire. The vernier engines never activated due to their startup timer being set sustainer to activate following sustainer start (which failed, thus preventing the start signal from being sent to the verniers). Despite these mishaps, the Atlas E was declared operational that month.|$|E

40|$|A <b>test</b> <b>port</b> {{designed}} {{as part of}} a fiber optic coupled laser altimeter receiver optical system allows for the back-illumination of the optical system for alignment verification, as well as illumination of the detector(s) for testing the receiver electronics and signal-processing algorithms. Measuring the optical alignment of a laser altimeter instrument is difficult after the instrument is fully assembled. The addition of a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> in the receiver aft-optics allows for the back-illumination of the receiver system such that its focal setting and boresight alignment can be easily verified. For a multiple-detector receiver system, the addition of the aft-optics <b>test</b> <b>port</b> offers the added advantage of being able to simultaneously test all the detectors with different signals that simulate the expected operational conditions. On a laser altimeter instrument (see figure), the aft-optics couple the light from the receiver telescope to the receiver detector(s). Incorporating a beam splitter in the aft-optics design allows for the addition of a <b>test</b> <b>port</b> to back-illuminate the receiver telescope and/or detectors. The aft-optics layout resembles a T with the detector on one leg, the receiver telescope input port on the second leg, and the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> on the third leg. The use of a custom beam splitter with 99 -percent reflection, 1 -percent transmission, and a mirrored roof can send the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> light to the receiver telescope leg as well as the detector leg, without unduly sacrificing the signal from the receiver telescope to the detector. The ability to test the receiver system alignment, as well as multiple detectors with different signals without the need to disassemble the instrument or connect and reconnect components, is a great advantage to the aft-optics <b>test</b> <b>port.</b> Another benefit is that the receiver telescope aperture is fully back-illuminated by the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> so the receiver telescope focal setting vs. pressure and or temperature can be accurately measured (as compared to schemes where the aperture is only partially illuminated). Fiber-optic coupling the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> also allows for the modularity of testing the receiver detectors with a variety of background and signal laser sources without the need of using complex optical set-ups to optimize the efficiency of each source...|$|E

Performance usually refers to a time-varying parameter, such as sessions per second, and ultimately is a stress of CPU power.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—FPGA-based {{reconfigurable}} systems {{allow the}} online adaptation to dynamically changing runtime requirements. The reliability of FPGAs, being manufactured in latest technologies, {{is threatened by}} soft errors, as well as aging effects and latent defects. To ensure reliable reconfiguration, it is mandatory to guarantee the correct operation of the reconfigurable fabric. This {{can be achieved by}} periodic or on-demand online testing. This paper presents a reliable system architecture for runtime-reconfigurable systems, which integrates two non-concurrent online test strategies: Pre-configuration online tests (PRET) and post-configuration online <b>tests</b> (<b>PORT).</b> The PRET checks that the reconfigurable hardware is free of faults by periodic or on-demand <b>tests.</b> The <b>PORT</b> has two objectives: It tests reconfigured hardware units after reconfiguration to check that the configuration process completed correctly and it validates the expected functionality. During operation, PORT is used to periodically check the reconfigured hardware units for malfunctions in the programmable logic. Altogether, this paper presents PRET, PORT, and the system integration of such test schemes into a runtime-reconfigurable system, including the resource management and test scheduling.

The compounds fell into four organic classes: ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols and aldehydes. Specific neurones present in the ascoid sensillum that responded {{to each of these}} classes of compound were characterized. A bioassay chamber was developed that gave female sandflies the choice of two odour sources. Female sandflies were attracted upwind by fox odour and were trapped in closer proximity to the fox odour port than the control port. Synthetic compounds were recombined in appropriate quantities to mimic the fox odour. In this bioassay, the synthetic blend attracted sandflies upwind, and again they were caught closer to the <b>test</b> <b>port</b> than the control port. Furthermore, the synthetic fox odour induced an electrophysiological response from neurones in the ascoid sensillum that was very similar to that induced by natural fox odour. No synthetic compound alone induced the same behavioural response from sandflies as did whole fox odour.
