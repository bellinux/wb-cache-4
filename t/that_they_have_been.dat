5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, {{either directly or indirectly}} (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E

Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.|$|E

5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E

5|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{animals are}} represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (weta) and snails. Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were {{the only sign of}} native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old. Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters. Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country. More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{has given}} Academy Awards to foreign {{language}} films since 1945. The Academy defines {{a foreign language}} film as a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Films that meet these criteria are eligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. They can be nominated for awards in categories other than Best Foreign Language Film provided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> commercially released in Los Angeles County and comply with the special rules governing those categories. In addition, foreign-language films produced in the United States {{are not eligible for}} Best Foreign Language Film, but are eligible for awards in other categories.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses {{consistency}} in self-reports of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} testing using two waves of longitudinal data from a large, national probability survey, the National AIDS Behavioral Survey. Of those reporting at Wave I <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> tested {{for reasons other than}} blood donation, 18 percent reported at Wave 2 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> tested. Of those reporting at Wave I <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> tested when <b>they</b> donated blood, 29 percent reported at Wave 2 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> tested. Inconsistent responses may be due to poor recall and to high self-presentation bias, that is, a desire to provide socially acceptable answers. Poor recall may be exacerbated by passive conditions such as blood donation. The authors conclude with recommendations for reducing measurement error in surveys of testing behavior...|$|R
5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{decides to}} reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into {{protective}} custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by Michael Wuertz and Anna Ramirez, detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes the jail with Lau.|$|E

5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network.

5|$|In England, Legal Deposit can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated at the time <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee {{the right to a}} speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|E
