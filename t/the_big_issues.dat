25|$|On 15 August 2008, Maoist leader Prachanda (Pushpa Kamal Dahal) {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Nepal, {{the first since}} the country's {{transition}} from a monarchy to a republic. On 4 May 2009, Dahal resigned over on-going conflicts {{with regard to the}} sacking of the Army chief. Since Dahal's resignation, the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>issues</b> being the proposed integration of the former Maoist combatants, also known as the People's Liberation Army, into the national security forces. After Dahal, Jhala Nath Khanal of CPN (UML) was elected the Prime Minister. Khanal was forced to step down as he could not succeed in carrying forward the Peace Process and the constitution writing. On August 2011, Maoist Babu Ram Bhattarai became third Prime Minister after the election of constituent assembly. On 24 May 2012, Nepals's Deputy PM Krishna Sitaula resigned.|$|E

500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>issues</b> of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E

2500|$|The Waffle was a {{group of}} mostly young, {{university}} students and intellectuals. It was formed in 1969 and was led at the convention by University of Toronto economist Mel Watkins, an NDP vice-president, and James Laxer, a candidate to replace Tommy Douglas as federal leader. The Unity Group — also known as [...] "NDP NOW", from the title of a pamphlet released earlier in the year that espoused its philosophy — was a committee of party establishment officials and organizers set up to oppose the Waffle at the convention by presenting more moderate views at the convention floor microphones. It was formed in 1970, after the well-organized Waffle had effectively taken over much of the floor debate at the Winnipeg Convention in October 1969. The group was headed by Desmond Morton, a University of Toronto professor who was involved with organizing the party in Ontario, and Marion Bryden, the director of research for the Ontario NDP. Lynn Williams, of the United Steelworkers, was the main link between the Unity Group and organized labour. [...] He helped co-ordinate the Canadian Labour Congress' (CLC) actions during the convention. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>issues</b> over which the groups fought were those of Quebec's right to self-determination, and large scale nationalization of the natural resources/energy sector. The Waffle was at the forefront for advocating these ideas, while the Unity Group put up the defence against these proposals The Unity Group won these debates, and the Waffle's motions on these issues were defeated or heavily modified.|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton's {{tenure as}} Secretary of State was popular {{at the time}} among the public and praised by President Obama, {{observers}} have noted {{that there was no}} signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, or Henry Kissinger. The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left. Many of Clinton's initiatives in the [...] "smart power" [...] realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that [...] "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>issues</b> for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy." [...] Michael E. O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution analyst, said that, [...] "Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [...] more solid than spectacular." [...] Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled , former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney argue that Clinton's tenure, and the Obama administration's foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since World War II. Others, however, such as Eric Schmidt disagree, and have argued that Clinton was [...] "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" [...] Acheson. All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, [...] "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> <b>the</b> world's {{most widely}} circulated street newspaper, {{is a good}} example of these two schools of thought. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. [...] In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> or that <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. [...] Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to [...] "fill the void" [...] in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.|$|R
