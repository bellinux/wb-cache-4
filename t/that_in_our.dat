However, Godsmack has {{attempted}} to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, [...] "I've just never really heard <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> music".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Kreacher the house-elf, who {{was included in}} the script only at Rowling's request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, one of which is a locket which becomes extremely important in the seventh book. [...] "It was kind of tricky to raise <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> story, because it's for so much later", Yates said. [...] "We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that's the approach we took". Whilst Kreacher remained, all scenes involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions given to other characters.|$|E
500|$|Ed Webb and Mark Wardecker, in a {{paper in}} Doctor Who and Philosophy, {{interpreted}} the Dalek history shown in Genesis of the Daleks as a warning that [...] "scientists {{will be the one}} to bring about the ultimate destruction, the ultimate evil, and deliberately so". They also commented that the serial showed that the Daleks were evil by design, rather than evolution. Davros represents a mad scientist who creates a monster that then consumes him. Sarah Honeychurch and Niall Burr, in the same book, wrote that the corruption of the Daleks showed that creatures should not be created with [...] "such limited moral reasoning," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> world we cannot [...] "impose our own personal human standards on everybody else".|$|E

500|$|In {{defending}} his conservatism, Brownlee emphasized that [...] "history {{has yet to}} record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery" [...] and mused that [...] "if the results were not so tragical, I {{would like to see}} Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our people could have the actual experience of what would happen and learn for themselves the lesson <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> present day world situation, one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position {{of the rest of the}} world". [...] Even as he rejected the radical solutions posed by others, Brownlee had no solutions of his own to offer but government thrift and moderate debt adjustment.|$|E
500|$|Speed Grapher {{was aimed}} at a mature {{audience}} to [...] "stimulate the audience at an intellectual level", according to director Kunihisa Sugishima. The story {{was influenced by the}} Japanese economic scenario in which there were several cases of suicides. He noted these cases must have been caused by the fact <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society [...] "financial fortune is equated with success and is expected to lead to happiness". He described Saiga as someone who opposes this system and Kagura as someone trapped on it. Gonzo opted to use little computer graphics and to create hand-drawn illustrations painted by computer for both the foreground and the background. In Sugishima's words: [...] "Because we wanted Speed Grapher to stand out because of its story, we chose not to use any special visual effects." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically. The song [...] "Del Tope al Fondo" [...] {{is influenced by}} Argentine music, especially the genre of tango. Lyrically, the band discusses more romantic themes {{as opposed to the}} political emphasis of the group's previous records. [...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the good things in the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We know that people need help, and that behind every revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> music, but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E

500|$|... "You're Killing Me", {{the longest}} {{song on the}} EP at three minutes and 20 seconds, {{is an example of}} the impact punk rock had on Pavement. The song {{features}} fuzz effects, repetitive lyrics, and no percussion or drums. [...] "Box Elder", an ironic song about someone wanting to move to Box Elder, Montana, was considered by Gerard Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus's [...] "honest, direct, and simplistic" [...] lyrical style, and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP. [...] "Maybe Maybe" [...] features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals, and [...] "Price Yeah!" [...] has a sound typical of hardcore punk. The band's hometown of Stockton inspired the band's lyrics and sound. Malkmus stated that [...] "There's something empty about Stockton. I wanted to convey <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> music." [...] Malkmus told Melody Maker in 1992 that [...] "Pavement was originally a pathetic effort by us to do something to escape the terminal boredom we were experiencing in Stockton." ...|$|E
500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1920, intercommunal {{conflict}} in Mandatory Palestine broke out, which widened into the regional Arab–Israeli conflict, {{often referred to}} as the world's [...] "most intractable conflict". The [...] "dual obligation" [...] to the two communities quickly proved to be untenable; the British subsequently concluded that it was impossible for them to pacify the two communities in Palestine by using different messages for different audiences. The Palestine Royal Commission – in making the first official proposal for partition of the region – referred to the requirements as [...] "contradictory obligations", and that the [...] "disease is so deep-rooted <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> firm conviction, the only hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation". Following the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, and as worldwide tensions rose in the build up to World War II, the British Parliament approved the White Paper of 1939 – their last formal statement of governing policy in Mandatory Palestine – declaring that Palestine should not become a Jewish State and placing restrictions on Jewish immigration. Whilst the British considered this consistent with the Balfour Declaration’s commitment to protect the rights of non-Jews, many Zionists saw it as a repudiation of the declaration. Although this policy lasted until the British surrendered the Mandate in 1948, it served only to highlight the fundamental difficulty for Britain in carrying out the Mandate obligations.|$|E

500|$|In October 2010, casting calls {{revealed}} the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots. In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza {{were removed from}} the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, [...] "It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut". Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants. On his hiring, Tait said [...] "I am 6'5" [...] and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7" [...] and taller, and weighed over [...] When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants". In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2. Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said [...] "We came to feel <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the [...] "special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D". The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengerss director, Joss Whedon.|$|E
