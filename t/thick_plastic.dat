25|$|Other celebrities {{have used}} glasses to {{differentiate}} {{themselves from the}} characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses with <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> frames like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.|$|E
25|$|If the {{economic}} and geological conditions are right, the mining company will level large areas of land with a small gradient, layering it with <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> (usually HDPE or LLDPE), sometimes with clay, silt or sand beneath the plastic liner. The extracted ore will typically be run through a crusher and placed in heaps atop the plastic. The leaching agent will then be sprayed on the ore for 30–90 days. As the leaching agent filters through the heap the uranium will break its bonds with the oxide rock and enter the solution. The solution will then filter along the gradient into collecting pools which will then be pumped to on-site plants for further processing. Only some of the uranium (commonly about 70%) is actually extracted.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic {{film is a}} thin {{continuous}} polymeric material. <b>Thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> {{material is}} often called a “sheet”. These thin plastic membranes are used to separate areas or volumes, to hold items, to act as barriers, or as printable surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Horn-rimmed {{glasses are}} {{a type of}} eyeglasses. Originally made out of either horn or {{tortoise}} shell, {{for most of their}} history they have actually been constructed out of <b>thick</b> <b>plastics</b> designed to imitate those materials. They are characterized by their bold appearance on the wearer's face, in contrast to metal frames, which appear less pronounced.|$|R
50|$|Photographic {{emulsions}} {{were originally}} coated on thin glass plates for imaging with electron microscopes, which provided a more rigid, stable and flatter plane compared to plastic films. Beginning in the 1970s, high-contrast, fine grain emulsions coated on <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> films manufactured by Kodak, Ilford and DuPont replaced glass plates. These films {{have largely been}} replaced by digitally imaging technologies.|$|R
500|$|The {{embankment}} required [...] {{of crushed}} rock. An on-site crushing plant crushed and processed over 14 {{million tons of}} rock in 20 months to supply the dam's materials. The cut-off wall, which consists of a [...] <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> concrete mix constructed through the weathered portion of bedrock, varies in depth from [...] to [...] and totals [...] A two-line grout curtain reaches depths of [...] below the foundation in the north segment of the East Dam and [...] in the south segment.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{wines are}} {{packaged}} in <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> bags within corrugated fiberboard boxes, and are called [...] "box wines", or [...] "cask wine". Tucked inside {{the package is}} a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh {{for up to a}} month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine oxidizes more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.|$|E
2500|$|Houses in the {{residential}} areas on {{the east and west}} sides of the canal were demolished. All that remains on the west side are abandoned residential streets. Some older east side residents, whose houses stand alone in the demolished neighborhood, chose to stay. It was estimated that fewer than 90 of the original 900 families opted to remain. They were willing to remain {{as long as they were}} guaranteed that their homes were in a relatively safe area. On June 4, 1980, the state government founded the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency (LCARA) to restore the area. The area north of Love Canal became known as Black Creek Village. [...] LCARA wanted to resell 300 homes that had been bought by New York when the residents were relocated. [...] The homes are farther away from where the chemicals were dumped. The most toxic area (...) was reburied with a <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> liner, clay and dirt. [...] A [...] high barbed wire fence was installed around the area. It has been calculated that 248 separate chemicals, including [...] of dioxin, have been unearthed from the canal.|$|E
5000|$|Magnet wire {{is solid}} wire, usually copper, which, to allow closer winding when making {{electromagnetic}} coils, is insulated only with varnish, {{rather than the}} <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> or other insulation commonly used on electrical wire. It {{is used for the}} winding of motors, transformers, inductors, generators, speaker coils, etc. (For further information about copper magnet wire, see: Copper wire and cable#Magnet wire (Winding wire).).|$|R
25|$|Most often, {{magnetic}} wire {{is composed of}} fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper to allow closer winding when making electromagnetic coils. The wire is coated {{with a range of}} polymeric insulations, including varnish, rather than the <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> or other types of insulation commonly used on electrical wire. High-purity oxygen-free copper grades are used for high-temperature applications in reducing atmospheres or in motors or generators cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|R
5000|$|Handguards in {{the first}} several series were [...] "square" [...] in section (see LC picture), {{covering}} from magazine well to front sight. This gave some problems with heat retention, so it was changed to a round [...] "half length" [...] handguard made of <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic,</b> over the full length stamped steel support piece. Almost all military rifles changed to the new handguard, but Guardia Civil rifles retained the squared version.|$|R

5000|$|Plastic {{bags were}} {{a major concern}} in South Africa before the bag levy was {{introduced}} in 2004. The bags were never banned, but a levy was introduced, payable by the plastic bag manufacturer. The <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> bags are levied and although this move initially caused outrage with consumers and an initial decline in volumes, consumers use has continually increased to several billion plastic shopping bags every year. http://www.econrsa.org/papers/p_papers/pp18.pdf ...|$|R
50|$|A {{nipple shield}} is a nipple-shaped sheath worn over the areola and nipple during breastfeeding. Modern nipple shields {{are made of}} soft, thin, {{flexible}} silicone and have holes {{at the end of}} the nipple section to allow the breast milk to pass through. Older nipple shields were made of latex and harder, <b>thicker</b> <b>plastics,</b> and often caused more problems than they solved. A 17th-century nipple shield held in Shakespeare's birthplace is made of pewter.|$|R
5000|$|Tube: The outer {{plastic tube}} {{is also an}} {{important}} feature that greatly affects the end use of any rope light. A rope light with relatively wider plastic tubing is more durable to external elements but less flexible. Thinner plastic tubing, on the other hand, is far more flexible but less robust. Generally, rope lights for heavy use outdoors feature <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> casings while those used for more decorative purposes indoors have relatively thin plastic casings.|$|R

50|$|Intended for use {{by small}} children, the Changeables line of toys was {{surprisingly}} sturdy as each figure was made from fairly <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> and typically contained only three moving parts. This made changing the individual figures from food item to robot/dinosaur and back fairly easy even for those within the intended age range.|$|E
50|$|Medical blister trays {{differ from}} {{pharmaceutical}} blister packs in {{that these are}} not push-through packs. The thermoformed base web is made of a <b>thicker</b> <b>plastic</b> sheet, generally between 500 to 1000 µ and can not be collapsed, thus forming a solid tray. The lidding film provides a peel-open feature and is generally porous to allow sterilization (such as the Dupont medical Tyvek material). Such medical blister packs are used for sterile medical devices, used in hospitals.|$|R

50|$|Haylage {{refers to}} high dry matter silage of around 45% to 75%. Horse haylage is usually 55% to 75% dry matter, made in small bales or larger bales.Handling of wrapped bales {{is most often}} with some type of gripper that squeezes the plastic-covered bale between two metal parts to avoid {{puncturing}} the plastic. Simple fixed versions are available for round bales which are made of two shaped pipes or tubes spaced apart to slide under {{the sides of the}} bale, but when lifted will not let it slip through. Often used on the tractor rear three-point linkage, they incorporate a trip tipping mechanism which can flip the bales over on to the flat side/end for storage on the <b>thickest</b> <b>plastic</b> layers.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboard}} is of <b>thick</b> <b>plastic</b> {{construction of}} a dark gray color with 61 weighted keys. There are assignable pitch, modulation wheels, and two patch select buttons.
