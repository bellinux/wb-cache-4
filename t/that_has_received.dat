5|$|If {{there is}} a tie, the song <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> more votes from the public {{receives}} the higher position. There have been two ties for {{first place in the}} history of the contest. In 1969, Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö. The juries them voted for their favourite out the two, leading to Tommy Körberg winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008 {{the winning}} entry of each contest has been decided by {{a mixture of}} televoting and {{national}} juries, each counting for {{fifty percent of the}} points awarded by each country. The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting. The ten entries that have received the most votes in each country are awarded points ranging from one to eight, then ten and twelve. These points are then announced live during the programme by a spokesperson representing the participating country (who, like the participants, is aged between ten and fifteen). Once all participating countries have announced their results, the country <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> the most points is declared the winner of that year's contest.|$|E

25|$|The {{electoral system}} in Sweden is proportional. Of the 349 {{seats in the}} unicameral Riksdag, 310 are fixed {{constituency}} seats allocated to 29 multi-member constituencies {{in relation to the}} number of people entitled to vote in each constituency. The remaining 39 adjustment seats are used to correct the deviations from proportional national distribution that may arise when allocating the fixed constituency seats. There is a constraint in the system that means that only a party <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> at least four per cent of the votes in the whole country participates in the distribution of seats. However, a party <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> at least twelve per cent of the votes in a constituency participates in the distribution of the fixed constituency seats in that constituency.|$|E

25|$|The {{microphone}} design {{differs from}} that of a conventional audio system in that the peculiar features of infrasound are taken into account. First, infrasound propagates over vast distances through the Earth's atmosphere as a result of very low atmospheric absorption and of refractive ducting that enables propagation by way of multiple bounces between the Earth's surface and the stratosphere. A second property <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> little attention is the great penetration capability of infrasound through solid matter – a property utilized in the design and fabrication of the system windscreens.|$|E

25|$|According to {{one theory}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> {{considerable}} scholarly acceptance, Hermes himself originated {{as a form}} of the god Pan, who has been identified as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European pastoral god *Péh2usōn, in his aspect as the god of boundary markers. Later, the epithet supplanted the original name itself and Hermes took over the roles as god of messengers, travelers, and boundaries, which had originally belonged to Pan, while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name in his more rustic aspect as the god of the wild in the relatively isolated mountainous region of Arcadia. In later myths, after the cult of Pan was reintroduced to Attica, Pan was said to be Hermes's son.|$|E

25|$|In theater, {{there are}} quite a few plays and musicals that have lesbian {{characters}} or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> a lot of recognition in the past few years is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay role models, and the awkwardness and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands out because it normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms.|$|E
25|$|The Clerk of Parliament is the Chief Executive of the Secretariat. As of 2009, the Clerk is Ms. Ng Sheau Jiuan. She is the {{principal}} adviser to the House on parliamentary procedures and practices. When Parliament is sitting, she is stationed at the Clerk's Table below the Speaker's Chair, and reads the orders of the day. The Clerk is appointed by the President after consultation with the Speaker and the Public Service Commission. She {{is supported by a}} Deputy Clerk, Principal Assistant Clerks and Assistant Clerks. The independence of the Clerk and her staff are protected to some extent by the Constitution. The Clerk can only be removed from office on the grounds of inability to discharge the functions of the office (whether arising from an infirmity of body or mind or any other cause) or for misbehaviour, and a parliamentary resolution <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> the affirmative votes of not less than two-thirds of all MPs is required. Further, the staff of Parliament are not eligible for promotion or transfer to any other office in the public service without the Speaker's consent.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their work on theaters, houses of worship, and commercial buildings, Liebenberg and Kaplan {{made significant contributions to}} residential design in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, designing homes for the Davenport, Fredan, Hendel, Hochman, and Piper families, among other influential Minneapolis residents. Most of the prestigious homes the firm designed were in the Lowry Hill area of Minneapolis. A notable example of the firm's residential design in Lowry Hill is the Webster/Deinard residence (1924). Originally designed for George Webster, the residence was purchased in 1947 by Amos Spencer Deinard, who lived in the home until 1985. Amos and his brother, Benedict, sons of Temple Israel's first Rabbi, Samuel N. Deinard, were founding members of the longstanding Minneapolis law firm Leonard, Street, and Deinard, established in 1922. Amos Deinard practiced civil law, and was chair of the Minneapolis Fair Employment Practices Commission, which held its meetings at the residence. Mr. Deinard also founded the Minneapolis Federation for Jewish Service, among other accomplishments. The home is the only L residence <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> historic designation (2014) and it retains virtually every element and material designed by its architects.|$|E

25|$|Articulatory-kinematic {{treatments}} {{have the}} strongest {{evidence of their}} use in treating Acquired Apraxia of Speech. These treatments use the facilitation of movement, positioning, timing, and articulators to improve speech production. Sound Production Treatment (SPT) is an articulatory-kinematic treatment <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> more research than many other methods. It combines modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation, articulatory placement cueing, and verbal feedback. It was developed to improve the articulation of targeted sounds in the mid-1990s. SPT shows consistent improvement of trained sounds in trained and untrained words. The best results occur with eight to ten exemplars of the targeted sound to promote generalization to untrained exemplars of trained sounds. In addition, maintenance effects are the strongest with 1–2 months post-treatment with sounds that reached high accuracy during treatment. Therefore, the termination of treatment should not be determined by performance criteria, and not {{by the number of}} sessions the client completes, in order to have the greatest long-term effects. While there are many parts of SPT that should receive further investigation, it can be expected that it will improve the production of targeted sounds for speakers with apraxia of Speech.|$|E
500|$|Food {{waste in}} the United Kingdom is a subject of environmental, {{economic}} and social concern <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> widespread media coverage and been met with varying responses from government. Since 1915, food waste {{has been identified as}} a considerable problem and {{has been the subject of}} ongoing media attention, intensifying with the launch of the [...] "Love Food, Hate Waste" [...] campaign in 2007. Food waste has been discussed in newspaper articles, news reports and television programmes, which have increased awareness of it as a public issue. To tackle waste issues, encompassing food waste, the government-funded [...] "Waste & Resources Action Programme" [...] (WRAP) was created in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The {{competition}} has many similarities to the Eurovision Song Contest from which its name is taken. Each participating broadcaster sends an act, {{the members of}} which are aged 9 to 14 {{on the day of}} the contest, and an original song lasting between 2 minutes 45 seconds and 3 minutes to compete against the other entries. Each entry represents the country served by the participating broadcaster. Viewers from the participating countries are invited to vote for their favourite performances by televote and a national jury from each participating country also vote. The overall winner of the contest is the entry <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> the most points after the scores from every country have been collected and totalled. The current winner is Mariam Mamadashvili of Georgia, who won the 2016 contest in Malta with [...] "Mzeo", becoming the highest scoring winner with a record 239 points (under a new voting system introduced in the 2016 contest).

500|$|The Maryland Senate, as {{the upper}} {{house of the}} {{bicameral}} Maryland General Assembly, shares with the Maryland House of Delegates the responsibility for making laws {{in the state of}} Maryland. Bills are often developed in the period between sessions of the General Assembly by the Senate's standing committees or by individual Senators. They are then submitted by Senators to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services for drafting of legislative language. Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 907 bills were introduced in the Senate annually during the three-month legislative session. The bill is submitted, and receives the first of three constitutionally mandated readings {{on the floor of the}} Senate, before being assigned to a committee. The decision about whether legislation passes is often made in the committees. Committees can hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor. The recommendations of committees on bills carry tremendous weight; it is rare for the Senate as a whole to approve legislation <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>received</b> a negative committee report. Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation, the bill returns to the floor for second hearing, called the [...] "consideration of committee" [...] report, and a third hearing, which happens just before the floor vote on it.|$|E
