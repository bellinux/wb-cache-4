40|$|Attempting {{to develop}} {{processes}} for {{the formulation of}} sustainable development policy is imperative in contempo-rary society. Ecological economics offers the opportunity to consider the integration of economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects of problems in sustainable development policy processes. Practical engagement in the integration of these various facets of a problem requires a release from disciplinary and institutional rigidity. To enable this release requires an enhanced understanding of our cultural referents that have historically promoted these divisions and hierarchys in knowledge claims. This paper proposes that more effective sustainable development processes can be sought by collectively considering the key ecological economic concepts of sustainability, transdisci-plinary and methodological pluralism. These concepts facilitate the critique of conventional policy processes, which then {{give way to a}} reformulated sustainable development policy process, termed the ‘discursive community’. Through genuine stakeholder collaboration, based on learning processes, the ‘discursive community ’ is able <b>to</b> <b>articulat...</b>|$|E
40|$|Documentary in {{contemporary}} art has a dual nature: {{on the one}} hand, it is considered central to artistic practice {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries; on the other, documentary has for a long time been perceived as peripheral in the art context. 1 Critics such as the modernist art historian Clement Greenberg famously challenged documentary’s status as art. For example, in a review of a photography exhibition he describes the inability of the photograph to “transcend its almost inevitable function as document and act as a work of art as well”. 2 Document and art are thus divided into two separate entities. Throughout the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century, a period during which modernism and the structural film movement dominated, documentary was less prominent. Moving image artists were producing conceptual and abstract film, moving away from a documentary style that was regarded as strongly associated with narrative conventions. Throughout the eighties and in particular the nineties, such movements as the collapse of socialism, feminism, gay rights and black liberation increasingly informed the practice of video artists, who embraced documentary as a means <b>to</b> <b>articulat...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} Hillier and Hanson's thought on society and space has wider {{implications}} for social theory in general and for applied historical research in particular than has previously been acknowledged. This epistemological isolation can, to an extent, be explained pragmatically by the inevitable difficulties of inter-disciplinary translation of historical research conducted in space syntax mode. However, the principle concern {{of this paper is}} to explore a more fundamental, theoretical, reason why researchers in the historical disciplines can struggle to engage with Hillier and Hanson's work: namely the marginalization of temporality in the 'theory of spatial description ' that is the con-ceptual foundation of the space syntax theory. The claim is not that time has been altogether ignored; on the contrary the temporal nature of reality figures largely in the theory. Rather, the argument here is that this aspect of the theory has, in practice, been deliberately subordinated to the overriding task of articulating a formal morphological grammar of social organization. Perhaps inevitably this em-phasis has focused attention on the synchronic structure of space, to which notions of temporality remained essentially external. However, it is equally clear that this emphasis has come at the cost of introducing some inconsistencies in the underlying theoretical proposition of spatial description. The consequence, it is claimed, has been to amplify the difficulty in using Hillier and Hanson <b>to</b> <b>articulat...</b>|$|E
