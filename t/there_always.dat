5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed <b>there</b> <b>always</b> existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, the German chemist Friedrich August Kekulé {{published}} {{a paper in}} French (for he was then teaching in Francophone Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a ring of six carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. The next year he {{published a}} much longer paper in German on the same subject. Kekulé used evidence that had accumulated in the intervening years—namely, that <b>there</b> <b>always</b> appeared to be only one isomer of any monoderivative of benzene, and that <b>there</b> <b>always</b> appeared to be exactly three isomers of every disubstituted derivative—now understood to correspond to the ortho, meta, and para patterns of arene substitution—to argue {{in support of his}} proposed structure. Kekulé's symmetrical ring could explain these curious facts, as well as benzene's 1:1 carbon-hydrogen ratio.|$|E

When goodness is lost, there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion." ...|$|R

25|$|Even {{the very}} date {{of his death}} is uncertain, as some records say this took place in summer, while another dates it at October 8 (that is after middle of Japanese autumn). Before he died, Goemon wrote a famous {{farewell}} poem, saying that no matter what, <b>there</b> <b>always</b> shall be thieves. A tombstone dedicated to him is located in Daiunin temple in Kyoto. A large iron kettle-shaped bathtub is now called a goemonburo ("Goemon bath").|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} by Euler's {{rotation}} theorem that, for any rotating frame, <b>there</b> <b>always</b> exists an instantaneous {{axis of rotation}} in any instant. In {{the case of a}} frame, the angular velocity vector is over the instantaneous axis of rotation. Any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has to behave as a two dimensional rotation. Thus, the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time t is consistent with the two dimensions case.|$|E
25|$|If a {{power series}} with radius of {{convergence}} r is given, one can consider analytic continuations of the series, i.e. analytic functions f which are defined on larger sets than { x : |x − c| < r } and {{agree with the}} given power series on this set. The number r is maximal in the following sense: <b>there</b> <b>always</b> exists a complex number x with |x − c| = r such that no analytic continuation of the series can be defined at x.|$|E

25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil wrong, is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, <b>there</b> <b>always</b> must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E
25|$|As of 2011, {{according}} to Martin Manna, the Chaldean American Chamber of Commerce's executive director, 75 of the 84 supermarkets in the Detroit city limits {{are owned by}} Chaldean Americans. Metro Foodland in the city is an African American owned business; it is the final remaining black-owned supermarket in Detroit, a majority black city. The owner, James Hooks, said that <b>there</b> <b>always</b> have been few black-owned grocery stores in Detroit. Former employees of Hooks had established two other black-owned stores, and both stores closed. Southwest Detroit has many independent grocery stores. In particular Southwest Detroit has several Hispanic supermarkets, or supermercados, that stock meat, specialty produce, and tortillas.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>always</b> {{have been}} {{brothers}} in the charterhouse. When Saint Bruno retired to the Chatreuse, two of his companions were secular ones: Andrew and Guerin. They also {{live a life of}} solitary prayer and join in the communal prayer and Mass in the chapel. However, the lay brothers are monks under slightly different types of vows and spend less time in contemplative prayer and more time in manual labour. The lay brothers provide material assistance to the choir monks: cooking meals, doing laundry, undertaking physical repairs, providing the choir monks with books from the library and managing supplies. The life of the brothers complements that of the choir monks, and makes the fathers' lives of seclusion possible.|$|E

500|$|... "Jai Ho" [...] {{is a song}} {{composed}} by A. R. Rahman for the 2008 film, Slumdog Millionaire. When Danny Boyle, the director of Slumdog Millionaire, approached Rahman to compose its soundtrack, he included the song. [...] "Jai Ho" [...] accompanies a choreographed dance sequence at the end credits of Slumdog Millionaire. The song features vocals from Sukhvinder Singh, Mahalaxmi Iyer and Vijay Prakash in Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. Indian singer Tanvi Shah wrote and provided vocals for a Spanish section of the song. [...] "Jai Ho" [...] is a Hindi phrase which can be roughly translated as [...] "Let [...] victory prevail", [...] "Let there be victory", or [...] "May <b>there</b> <b>always</b> be victory".|$|E
500|$|Public {{opinion about}} ethnic {{diversity}} {{on the court}} [...] "varies widely depending on the poll question's wording". For example, in two polls taken in 1991, one resulted in half of respondents agreeing that it was [...] "important that <b>there</b> <b>always</b> be at least one black person" [...] on the Court while the other had only 20% agreeing with that sentiment, and with 77% agreeing that [...] "race should never {{be a factor in}} choosing Supreme Court justices". [...] It is claimed that the Presidents who have appointed Justices to the Supreme Court in recent years have taken race and religion into account, causing it to be unrepresentative of the U.S. population in general.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the revelation}} {{at the end}} of the film that Arroway's {{recording}} device recorded approximately 18 hours of static is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of—if not the experience of—her [...] "journey", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: [...] "The point of the movie is for <b>there</b> <b>always</b> to be a certain amount of doubt [...]" [...] These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the [...] "journey" [...] that echo Ellie's experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens [...] "downloading [...] thoughts and memories"), but the timing of the message's arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S.R. Hadden (Arroway's only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.|$|E
500|$|... "The Fear" [...] debuted {{at number}} 168 on the UK Singles Chart on 25 January 2009―for the week ending dated 31 January 2009. The {{following}} week, the song climbed 167 places {{to the top}} of the chart, thwarting Lady Gaga's [...] "Just Dance" [...] from the summit. Gaga commented on this, saying, [...] "I'm very familiar with Lily's music and good job Lily for knocking me off. <b>There</b> <b>always</b> deserves to be a female on top and I don't want to be the only one to do it. I think generally that pop music is making an enormous comeback and I'm actually very pleased with Lily Allen's new record as it's decidedly pop". The song managed to remain on top for four weeks, throughout the whole of February, until it was dethroned by Kelly Clarkson's [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You". It thus earned Allen's second chart-topper, since her debut single, [...] "Smile", achieved the feat in July 2006. [...] "The Fear" [...] also became the single which spent more weeks atop the chart of 2009 in the UK. On the single's third week stay at number one, its parent album, It's Not Me, It's You topped the UK Albums Chart, having a chart double, to which Allen said: [...] "It's great being at the top of both charts, especially in the same week as the Brit Awards are once again celebrating the best of British music." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't <b>there</b> <b>always</b> a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E
