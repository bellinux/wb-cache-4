5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time.

5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience discomfort and disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E

5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of,</b> 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E

5|$|Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{prevailing}} {{winds and}} rains on the walls, the mosque has needed several renovations and restoration work which {{over the years}} have altered some of its exterior designs. In September 2002, a severe storm destroyed the mihrab and the minaret. As a result, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) placed the mosque on the 2002 World Monuments Watch, also considering the damage sustained after the inappropriate restoration in the 1970s. The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board decided to restore the mosque and sought advice from CRAterre, an architectural firm based in Grenoble, France which has expertise in building earthen structures. The renovation work was supported by a WMF, with a grant fund of US$50,000 from American Express. The local community also provided support. The conservation process involved removal of the earlier cement plaster from the surfaces of the mosque, the wooden structural components were replaced, the minaret and the mihrab were reconstructed, the portal was redone, and the interior and exterior surfaces were plastered in the traditional way. The renovation resulted in reassessing the state of conservation of the site, involving a team of local artisans and labourers. It helped to restore the monument with special emphasis on reviving the knowledge of mud-plaster maintenance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives To {{determine}} whether cartilage biopsies from specific regions of osteoarthritic knee joints differ in susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>the</b> degradative <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amounts of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β; 1 – 10 pg/ml) found in osteoarthritic joints. To establish whether biopsies are sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> either IL- 1 β or TNFα or both catabolic cytokines. Methods Cartilage from specified regions of 22 osteoarthritic knee joints was examined. Biopsies were incubated for 14 days without or with IL- 1 β or TNFα at physiological concentrations and GAG release into supernatants assessed. Results Variation {{was observed in}} susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 1 – 10 pg/ml IL- 1 β in biopsies from different sites within the same joints and the same site in different joints. The number of regions responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cytokine increased significantly (P< 0. 0063, Chi square test) with concentration: only 10 % (2 / 21) of all regions tested were susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 1 pg/ml IL- 1 β, whereas 45 % (9 / 20) were susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 5 pg/ml and 56 % (10 / 18) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 10 pg/ml IL- 1 β. Significantly fewer regions (4 %, 2 / 47) responded to both IL- 1 β and TNFα (P< 0. 047, Chi square test); biopsies from some patients responded to neither cytokine. Conclusions IL- 1 β, at the low concentrations detected in joints, can degrade cartilage from susceptible locations. Susceptibility of some cartilage biopsies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> either IL- 1 β and TNFα, but not both, suggests the signalling receptors for the two major catabolic cytokines are not usually expressed concurrently. The fact that some biopsies respond to neither cytokine suggests that in some patients the local concentration of inhibitors may be high or that other catabolic stimuli predominate. These results could {{have important implications for}} pharmacological intervention strategies...|$|R
