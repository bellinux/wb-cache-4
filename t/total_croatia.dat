40|$|Croatia {{has reached}} {{demographic}} maturity, with ever lower cohorts of youngers (and younger labour force numbers), longer life expectations, and rapidly growing share of older population. In such situation, working population older than 50 {{becomes more and}} more significant, not only by number, but also as an important pool of knowledge and experiences. 28, 36 % of <b>total</b> employed in <b>Croatia</b> in 2014 were 50 + years old. That same year (2014) 27, 7 % of <b>total</b> unemployed in <b>Croatia</b> were 50 + years old. The share of persons 50 + in total number of unemployed grew to 29, 6 % in 2015, and 31, 7 % in 2016. Long duration of unemployment is especially accentuated among persons older than 50 : in 2016 older persons made 41, 91 % among those with unemployment duration between 2 and 3 years, 44, 00 % among those with unemployment duration between 4 and 5 years, 53, 23 % among those with unemployment duration between 6 and 8 years, and even 70, 04 % among those with unemployment duration over 8 years. Although Croatian governments for almost quarter of century were devising different “active labour market policies” directed to older persons, their results are questionable. With growing problems to acquire and retain necessary workforce in Croatian enterprises, there is obviously strong need to develop new approach (es) towards people older than 50. This paper is trying to shed new light on this problem and offer new ideas in the field of labour market policies, and human resources management oriented towards older employees in Croatia. The Croatian example (changes, problems, and experiences) may be of interest to other, particularly European, countries in a similar situation...|$|R

50|$|The {{main reasons}} {{brought by the}} {{appealing}} party were the high CO2 {{that will lead to}} worsening of the population health in the region as well as global warming effect and increased dependence on the imported coal. Furthermore, it will not allow Croatia to meet the conditions imposed by EU regarding the decrease of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This may affect even the economic side of the project as it may lead to the purchase of additional greenhouse gas emissions credits under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Prof.dr.sc Enco Tireli, a local expert, who worked for HEP for more than 20 years and was also construction manager for Plomin B, confirmed the fact that the project will not be profitable due to the additional payment for CO2 credits. According to EU goals, <b>Croatia's</b> <b>total</b> emissions will be in the range between 1.566 and 6.264 million tones Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) annually, while only Plomin C would emit 2.644 million tones CO2eq.

The {{aim was to}} estimate outpatient consumption of psychotropic drugs in Croatia in correlation with Scandinavian countries. Data on drug utilization in Croatia were collected and analyzed for the 2001 - 2003 period. Data were obtained from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy and extrapolated to {{the total number of}} pharmacies. All drugs were classified according to Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) drug classification system. These data were used to calculate a number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID). Data of the Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee were used for Scandinavian countries.

Analysis was based on a multistage stratified sample representative of general adult population in six regions of Croatia (Croatian Adult Health Survey). Synthetic CVRB was defined by incidents (heart attack, stroke), blood pressure, overweight/obesity (BMI, waist circumference), and risky behaviours (smoking, physical inactivity, high alcohol consumption, inadequate nutrition). <b>Total</b> CVRB in <b>Croatia</b> was 44. 7 % for men and 50. 3 % for women. Combining both high and moderate CVRB, men were found to be under more risk than women (72. 8 % vs. 61. 7 %, respectively). The result showed an east-north-west gradient in continental Croatia, with high CVRB in Eastern (40. 2 %) and Central region (44. 3 %), City of Zagreb (45. 7 %) and Northern region (53. 1 %). Mountainous region had the lowest prevalence of respondents with high CVRB (39. 2 %). Coastal region with the prevalence of 46. 3 % of high CVRB was nearly the same as the City of Zagreb.

40|$|The {{existence}} of home bias in trade is {{considered as one}} of six main puzzles in international economics. The measurement of the average intra-national distance has become the crucial issue in estimating the home bias in goods trade for countries with no internal trade data. The aim {{of this article is}} to demonstrate how different internal distance measurement affects home bias in trade. The results of the analysis indicate that sub-unit based weighted measures perform better in the assessment of Croatia’s internal distance than area based and measures based on relation to neighbour countries. In estimating the model, we use data on import values for Croatia according to standard gravity theory. Regression analysis corroborates theoretical assumptions regarding the impact of geographical distance of countries and transport costs on bilateral trade flows; imports from world are positively correlated with the GDP of imported countries and negatively correlated with the distance between them. The values of home bias variable for <b>Croatia’s</b> <b>total</b> imports were slightly higher than results obtained from previous explorations for EU countries meaning that there is still place for Croatia’s deeper integration into EU trade flows...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows the}} changes in the populations of Croatian and Serbian ethnic {{affiliation}} in Croatia based on population censuses of 1991 and 2001. In the last intercensal period (1991 - 2001), methodological definitions of resident population changed significantly, Croatia's administrative-territorial borders changed and a war occurred (1991 - 1995), all of which influenced the demographical situation of Croatia. It is of special importance that the term "ethnic affiliation" is significantly unstable and unpredictable and highly influenced by both subjective and external influences, which make its analysis even more difficult. By establishing a connection between the old (1991) and the new (2001) names of settlements, the authors demonstrated {{the changes in}} the share of ethnic Croats and Serbs in the total population of towns and municipalities in Croatia in the observed intercensal period. Both the demographic and the ethnic profile of Croatia changed in the period of 1991 - 2001. The <b>total</b> population of <b>Croatia,</b> as well as the population of ethnic Serbs, decreased in this period, while the population of ethnic Croats increased. Since Croatia had a negative natural increase in the observed period, this increase is attributed to migrations and changes in declarations of ethnic affiliation.

President Tuđman {{announced}} his manifesto for a new Constitution (ratified {{at the end of}} the year) and a multitude of political, economic, and social changes, notably to what extent minority rights (mainly for Serbs) would be guaranteed. Local Serb politicians opposed the new constitution. In 1991, Croats represented 78.1% and Serbs 12.2% of the <b>total</b> population of <b>Croatia,</b> but the latter held a disproportionate number of official posts: 17.7% of appointed officials in Croatia, including police, were Serbs. An even greater proportion of those posts had been held by Serbs in Croatia earlier, which created a perception that the Serbs were guardians of the communist regime. This caused discontent among the Croats despite the fact it never actually undermined their own dominance in SR Croatia. After the HDZ came to power, many Serbs employed in the public sector, especially the police, were fired and replaced by Croats. This, combined with Tuđman's remarks, i.e. [...] "they declare that my wife is Jewish or Serbian. Luckily for me, she never was either", were distorted by Milošević's media to spark fear that any form of an independent Croatia would be a new [...] "Ustashe state".
