The torsion is found to impart a preferential twist to the cross-sectional flow. This loss of symmetry ensures that flow separation is less severe for a helical bend than for a <b>toroidal</b> <b>bend.</b> The effects of variations in body size are examined using allometric scaling laws. In the second part of the paper, the approach to “fully developed ” Dean or Womersley flow is considered in an attempt to quantify the regions of validity of idealised models.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on the magnetostatic ring studies at Frankfurt University. The various effects arising by {{confinement}} of non-neutral plasmas in the longitudinal magnetic field were studied in the last 2 years. Subjects of detailed investigation were the behaviour of confined charged clouds in Gabor lenses[1] and solenoids, the consequences of a hollow density profile and of mirror charges on the cloud stability (diocotron instabilities), the transient behaviour near the Brillouin flow limit (spatial variation of the Larmor radius). The beam injection into high current magnetostatic low energy storage ring with a longitudinal magnetic guiding field is investigated by experimental test setups with two <b>toroidal</b> <b>bending</b> segments. Also the particle confinement will be tested there [2], space charge compensation an...|$|R
40|$|Results {{obtained}} from the thin-section electron microscopy of salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster mainly support the concept of cable-like organization of polytene chromosomes, with disk-like bands composed of parallel bundles of homologous chromomeres. Outward orientation of loop fibres may generally cause a <b>toroidal</b> <b>bending</b> in the chromomere bundles. Both longitudinal and transverse sections of polytene chromosomes indicate that the bands may contain toroidal subunits. Torus-shaped bands were only found in thin sections of the most distal and most proximal regions, {{as well as in}} certain heavy bands at the late-replicating regions of polytenized interphase chromosomes. This suggests that an incomplete duplication of chromomeres may be a reason for torus formation, by preventing the separation of sister chromatids at the earliest phases of the polytenization process. The appearance of more numerous, but smaller, subunits in thin-sectioned faint bands is interpreted as a consequence of more complete segregation of sister chromatids in those bands during polytenization...|$|R
2500|$|By early 1952 {{there were}} {{numerous}} pinch devices in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines under the name Sceptre, and the Harwell team had built a series of ever-larger machines known as Mark I through Mark IV. In the US, Tuck built his Perhapsatron in January 1952. It was later learned that Fuchs had passed the UK work to the Soviets, {{and that they had}} started a fusion programme as well. It was clear to all of these groups that something was seriously wrong in the pinch machines. As the current was applied, the plasma column inside the vacuum tube would become unstable and break up, ruining the compression. Further work identified two types of instabilities, nicknamed [...] "kink" [...] and [...] "sausage". In the kink, the normally <b>toroidal</b> plasma would <b>bend</b> to the sides, eventually touching the edges of the vessel. In the sausage, the plasma would neck down at locations along the plasma column to form a pattern similar to a link of sausages.|$|R
