She and her friend, My Name Is Earl writer Vali Chandrasekaran, had held a Diwali party in 2005 for {{the cast of}} their two shows. According to Kaling, NBC was [...] "so excited. They were like, 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> this holiday? I've never heard of it'."

500|$|Charlotte's {{discovery}} of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island. Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte's backstory beyond the flashback in [...] "Confirmed Dead"she noted [...] "I feel like I'm almost in the same seat as the audience, like 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> going on?' and 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> going to happen next?', it's really exciting actually". She found it freeing to not know her character's history, and felt it made her give a natural performance. Mader felt Charlotte's relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer, more human side, and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry. Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Once the strike was resolved, a further six episodes were written, two less than originally planned for the season, {{and as a result}} Charlotte's role continued into season five. She enjoyed speaking Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and wished the full scene had been aired. Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island, and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert, as his character also has a history on the island. However when negotiating contracts in June 2008 she found out that her character would die during season five; Mader summed up Charlotte's season five arc as her demise. Charlotte's death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five. Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only just learning Charlotte's backstory, and Kitsis thought Mader's performance [...] "elevate the words to a whole other level". Mader called it [...] "the best thing [...] ha ever done in [...] entire career" [...] and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews. In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode and show, calling them, [...] "at best, a mediocre adventure in detective comedy television". He considered the episode [...] "mindless" [...] {{when compared to}} Monk, which preceded the episode. Moriarty stated that, when not comparing Psych to other shows, the episode is still [...] "making you wonder what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> {{going on in the}} minds of the show's writers and producers". He questioned the show's ability to last due to having to continue the fake psychic concept, and called detectives Lassiter and O'Hara [...] "completely unlikeable". Moriarty stated that things in the installment [...] "simply don't make any sense". He questioned whether the show would be able to last more than one season, and said that [...] "we highly recommend you continue to take a pass on Psych and save yourself from the mindlessness of it all". The installment was given a rating of 6, or [...] "okay", tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season, with the preceding episode, [...] "Spellingg Bee".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> going on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting.

Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E

Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media.

I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'"

500|$|The 1926 World Series {{produced}} one of {{the most}} famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year-old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, [...] "I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, [...] "I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards.

500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> going on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
