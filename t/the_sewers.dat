5|$|After {{cutting and}} dyeing her hair, Sil takes an {{attraction}} to Preston, having dreamt of him the previous night. After the team celebrates their apparent victory, she stalks {{them in their}} hotel, {{and they do not}} recognize her. Arden, who is upset at being single, walks into his room to find Sil waiting there. She has intercourse with Arden, then kills him when he realizes who she is. Dan senses that Sil is in the hotel and he alerts Preston, Laura, {{and the rest of the}} team. She morphs again and escapes and they follow her into <b>the</b> <b>sewers</b> where Fitch is subsequently killed. Sil gives birth and Dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind <b>the</b> <b>sewers.</b> The child attacks him and he incinerates it.

5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, while many of <b>the</b> <b>sewers</b> were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined {{with the introduction of}} flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into <b>the</b> <b>sewers,</b> along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, many of <b>the</b> <b>sewers</b> in the {{community}} of Eagles Mere discharged into tributaries of Muncy Creek, such as Outlet Run. Sewage was also discharged into Muncy Creek in Hugesville. Additionally, in the early 1900s, the waters of Muncy Creek were contaminated with tannery waste products from Muncy Valley and also chemicals. For this reason, the creek was only used for power during this time. Additionally, a methyl alcohol plant, the Nordmont Chemical Works, discharged chemicals into the creek at Nordstown. Other major industries in the watershed {{in the early part of}} the 1900s included clay mines and furniture factories.|$|E

Based on the results of the passport, a hydraulic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> network was performed. The technical and operational state of the selected sections and the objects on <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> network was evaluated.

In the next part of the thesis, there were chosen methods of rehabilitation of <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> network and <b>the</b> design of new waste water treatment plants.

40|$|The {{formation}} and fate of sulfide in a force main and a downstream-located gravity sewer were investigated in an extensive field study. Sulfide formation during approximately 4 hours of anaerobic transport in the force main was significant. <b>The</b> following gravity <b>sewer</b> was aerobic and a fast {{reduction of the}} sulfide concentration was observed due to sulfide oxidation and emission of hydrogen sulfide gas to <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> atmosphere. During 14 minutes of transport in <b>the</b> gravity <b>sewer,</b> <b>the</b> sulfide concentration decreased on average 30 %. Despite the continuous emission of hydrogen sulfide, the concentration in the atmosphere of <b>the</b> gravity <b>sewer</b> was generally below 3 % of the concentration in equilibrium with the sulfide concentration in the wastewater. This observation demonstrated that removal of hydrogen sulfide gas by adsorption onto <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> walls exposed to <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> atmosphere was fast compared with emission from the wastewater. An application of a conceptual sewer process model for simulating the {{formation and}} fate of sulfide in wastewater collection systems was demonstrated. The model was able to reproduce the average conditions in <b>the</b> investigated intercepting <b>sewer</b> satisfactory, but could {{not account for the}} observed variability. Overall, the model predicted that approximately 90 % of the decrease of the sulfide concentration in <b>the</b> gravity <b>sewer</b> was due to sulfide oxidation and that only a small fraction entered <b>the</b> <b>sewer</b> atmosphere, causing odor and corrosion. Even so, the model predicted concrete corrosion rates of up to 1. 2 mm per year in <b>the</b> gravity <b>sewer</b> section...|$|R
