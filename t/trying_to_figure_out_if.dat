50|$|After {{doing a lot}} of {{research}} on the WAK, several research questions have been answered. For example, researchers have found out that the WAK can work without an outlet because it has been able to function on a nine-volt battery. Although, it has been argued by researchers that using nine-volt batteries are not effective enough for the WAK because it does not power the device long enough and indirectly it makes the WAK less affordable when having to constantly change the batteries. Due to this, other energy sources are being explored, for example, researchers are seeing if fuel cells, wireless transmission of energy from an active source, or harvesting energy from the environment would be better ways to power the WAK for longer periods of time. Several questions have been answered about the WAK, but many research questions are still left unanswered. Researchers are still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> the WAK can be energy efficient, affordable, and if it can reuse small amounts of dialysate.|$|E
