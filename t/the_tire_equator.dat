50|$|Higher volume {{producers}} typically utilize specialized {{tire and}} wheel mounting and inflation equipment which is partially or fully automated. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> size, machines {{may be a}} single station or multistation. In these machines, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated using high volume, high pressure compressed air that flows into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> around <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead rather than through the valve stem. When <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> has achieved <b>the</b> desired inflation pressure, the machine's inflation head moves away from <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> inflation process is completed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> earth-rammed <b>tires</b> of an Earthship are {{assembled}} by teams of two people. One person shovels dirt {{and places it}} into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> one scoop at a time. The other person, who stands on <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> uses a sledgehammer to pack the dirt in while moving {{in a circle around}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to keep <b>the</b> dirt even and to avoid warping <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|RFV {{can best}} be {{explained}} by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> wheel we will see zero change as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and variation in the elastomeric properties of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides {{puncturing}} of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> a flat can {{be caused}} by:failure of or damage to the valve stem;rubbing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> road, ripping <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> or separation of tire and rim by collision with another object; excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread allowing explosive tire failure or allowing road debris to tear through it.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> {{wheel of a}} vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> pressure pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> inside of the wheel rim so that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> stays on <b>the</b> wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} beadlock is {{very much}} like an inner tube within <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tight against <b>the</b> wheel. The internal beadlock is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the beadlock closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the beadlock from inflating too far up into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This forces <b>the</b> sides into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which compresses <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R

And by modeling the air in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> cavity-resonance noise is able to simulate. Finite element model also enables to verify easily the effect of structure modification...|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of patching a tire is {{that due to}} the process requiring one to remove <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from <b>the</b> wheel, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> must be balanced again when it is put back on <b>the</b> wheel. <b>Tire</b> sealant also creates an imbalance in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> but since it is a temporary repair, it is considered less of an issue. However, the issue of disposal of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> sealant, <b>the</b> hazards to the technician, {{as well as the}} required cleaning of both the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> as well as the wheel could all be considered disadvantages of tire sealant.|$|R
50|$|Tires can leak air for {{a variety}} of reasons. These include, but are not limited to: damage to the wheel itself, a damaged valve stem, a {{puncture}} in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (which can be hard to find if the puncturing object didn't embed itself in <b>the</b> <b>tire)</b> and improper installation of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> which could involve the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> being cut when installed with excessive force.|$|R
50|$|The bicycle pump {{compresses}} air. When {{the cylinder}} is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump {{and then into}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> via <b>the</b> valve, which is forced open by {{the pressure of the}} air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is at <b>the</b> correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> cap can be replaced on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and apply <b>the</b> set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract <b>the</b> measurement parameters. <b>Tires</b> are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{is running}} from the police, it comes across {{a group of people}} burning a large pile of <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> film then jumps to three days later showing the results of a killing spree. The cops find <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{watching}} an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling <b>the</b> woman <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is interested in) with dynamite, intending for <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to blow <b>the</b> mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> destroys <b>the</b> mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> with a shotgun, after which he gives <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> man in the wheelchair. A tricycle emerges from the house and kills the man in the wheelchair. The tricycle begins rolling down <b>the</b> road; other <b>tires</b> begin rolling behind it and they eventually roll to Hollywood, where the film concludes.|$|R

30|$|As {{the running}} wheel uses rubber <b>tires,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> parts of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> are {{subjected}} to uneven pressure during the crossing of the finger-band, resulting in {{a change in the}} amount of deformation and a vertical vibration of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> [7, 8].|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> angle between the actual path of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (<b>the</b> angle that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> leans from <b>the</b> vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is fitted by heating to a {{controlled}} temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to expand. <b>The</b> wheel centre, usually already {{mounted on the}} axle, is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which is flange side up. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> cools, and <b>the</b> retaining ring (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the retaining ring.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> bead is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that {{contacts}} <b>the</b> rim {{on the wheel}}. The bead {{is typically}} reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel {{to ensure that a}} tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> profile.|$|R
50|$|While tire {{lettering}} {{was previously}} drawn or painted onto <b>the</b> <b>tires,</b> in <b>the</b> late 1960s, <b>tire</b> manufacturers began producing white letter tires {{that were part}} of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R

The expert's conclusion that a defect in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> caused <b>the</b> accident rested on certain observations about <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed. Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> expert's methodology, and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|R
50|$|A {{flat tire}} (British English: flat tyre) is a {{deflated}} pneumatic tire, {{which can cause}} {{the rim of the}} wheel to ride on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread or <b>the</b> ground potentially resulting in loss of control of the vehicle or irreparable damage to <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> most common cause of a flat tire is puncturing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> by a sharp object, such as a nail, letting air escape. Depending on the size of <b>the</b> puncture, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> may deflate slowly or rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Overly narrow rims in {{relation}} to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> width may cause poor handling as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> may distort sideways under fast cornering. On motorcycles, a narrow rim will alter <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> profile, concentrating tire wear {{in a very small}} area during cornering, with a smaller contact patch during braking.|$|R
50|$|The {{diameter}} of the circle of forces, and therefore the maximum horizontal force that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> can generate, depends upon many factors, including the design of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and its condition (age and temperature, for example), the qualities of the road surface, and the vertical load on <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{for this}} {{technique}} is the performance characteristics of <b>the</b> modern automotive <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tires</b> on your car have a specific maximum amount of grip (one component of 'grip' being friction). <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is also load sensitive——that is the maximum grip developed at any instant in time is dependent upon the force applied at <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to tarmac interface. The driver has great influence upon the load on a given <b>tire</b> and also <b>the</b> rate at which that load is applied to <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most tire {{chains are}} {{wrapped around the}} {{circumference}} of <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> and held in place with rim chains, which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable tensioners. Automatic chains do not wrap around <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> but swing under <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from devices permanently mounted under the vehicle which deploy via an electronic solenoid activated in the cab. Spikes-Spider (registered trademark) mount onto <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> from one side. FlexTrax (registered trademark) uses a ratcheting system for easier installation.|$|R
50|$|Tire {{forces are}} divided into three axes: radial, lateral, and {{tangential}} (or fore-aft). The radial axis runs from <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> center toward <b>the</b> tread, and is the vertical axis running from the roadway through <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> center toward <b>the</b> vehicle. This axis supports the vehicle’s weight. The lateral axis runs sideways across the tread. This axis is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> mounting axle on the vehicle. The tangential axis is {{the one in the}} direction of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> travel.|$|R
5000|$|Skid marks {{are divided}} into [...] "acceleration marks" [...] created on acceleration, if the engine {{provides}} more power than <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> can transmit; [...] "braking marks," [...] if the brakes [...] "lock up" [...] and cause <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to slide; or [...] "yaw marks", if <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> slides sideways. Each has a characteristic appearance, and an experienced accident reconstructor or forensic engineer can often determine what the vehicle was doing by examining the marks left by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} <b>tires</b> from rims. <b>The</b> inner-most diameter of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that interfaces with a wheel is called <b>the</b> <b>Tire</b> Bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead creates <b>the</b> air seal between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and rim on a radial-ply tire and a bias-ply <b>tire.</b> Often, <b>the</b> bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} bead breaker in order to be removed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of ted tire {{sealants}} which act {{in a similar way}} to self-sealing tires. These compounds are normally injected through <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve. <b>The</b> rotating force then distributes the compound onto the inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to act as a self-sealing lining within <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The final method, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> plug, can be {{performed}} without removing <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> penetrating object is removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and a plug coated in rubber cement then inserted with a handle, typically supplied with the kit. Many technicians consider plugs less reliable than patching though more reliable than sealant.|$|R
50|$|It is {{extremely}} important for owners to {{have an understanding of}} what is safe and what is not {{when it comes to their}} <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> three major areas to keep an eye on is the tread, sidewall, and air pressure of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Having <b>the</b> correct air pressure in your vehicle's tires lets your vehicle perform in the most efficient way possible. When objects such as a screw or nail puncture a tire, it creates a small leak in <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This leads to under-inflation of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> When a tire is under-inflated, it causes the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to heat up. This heat compromises the internal structure of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which can lead to a blowout. When a tire is over-inflated, it wears the tread down faster, and becomes more prone to catching nails or screws in <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> best way to check tire maintenance is to check the air pressure, because that will lead you to whatever problem your tire might have.|$|R
50|$|Sticky {{materials}} such as mud may adhere to <b>the</b> smooth outer <b>tire</b> surface, while smooth loose objects such as stones can become temporarily embedded in the tread grooves as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> rolls over <b>the</b> ground. These materials can be ejected {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> at high velocity as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> imparts kinetic energy to the attached objects. For a vehicle moving forward, the top of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is rotating upward and forward, and can throw objects into the air at other vehicles or pedestrians in front of the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tire</b> bead is <b>the</b> {{term for}} {{the edge of a}} tire that sits on the wheel. Wheels for automobiles, bicycles, etc. are made with a small slot or groove into which <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead sits. When <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is {{properly}} inflated the air pressure within <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> keeps <b>the</b> bead in this groove.|$|R
5000|$|The {{early days}} of motor travel took place on {{primitive}} roads that were littered with stray horseshoe nails. Punctures (flat tires) were all too common, and required the motorist to remove the wheel from the car, demount <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> patch <b>the</b> inner tube, re-mount <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> inflate <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and re-mount <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} {{of parts of}} a <b>tire</b> is <b>the</b> direct result of tire–road interactions, and therefore is of great interest in tire sensor development. This case study focuses on {{the analysis of the}} {{deformation of}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass and investigates its potential for the estimation of <b>the</b> in-plane <b>tire</b> force. <b>The</b> deformation of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass due to applied steady-state in-plane forces is first analyzed with the flexible ring model and then validated through optical tire sensor measurements. Coupled deformations of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass in <b>the</b> radial and tangential directions are observed. This reveals a promising method for tire sensing applications in the estimation of <b>the</b> in-plane <b>tire</b> force, which relies only on direct measurements of the radial deformation of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass. Moreover, indicators are proposed to correlate the radial deformation of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass with in-plane tire forces...|$|R
5000|$|The wheel size is the {{diameter}} of the wheel in inches where the beads of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> sit on <b>the</b> wheel. This measurement does not include the rim flange. Modern road tires have several measurements associated with their size as specified by tire codes like 225/70R14. The first number in the code (e.g., [...] "225") represents <b>the</b> nominal <b>tire</b> width in millimeters. This is followed by the aspect ratio (e.g.,"70"), which is the height of the side wall expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal width. [...] "R" [...] stands for radial and relates to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> construction. <b>The</b> final number in the code (e.g.,"14") is the rim size measured in inches. The overall circumference of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> will increase by increasing any of <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> specifications. For example, increasing the width of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> will also increase its circumference, because the side wall height is a proportional length. Increasing the aspect ratio will increase the height of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and hence <b>the</b> circumference.|$|R
