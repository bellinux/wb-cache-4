40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an alternative}} approach to modelling the expected loss cost of an insurance portfolio that allows for dependence between the frequency and severity components of the aggregate claims process. The traditionally used independent aggregate claims model is extended to define a dependent model, thus allowing for a correlation between the claim counts and claim amounts. A Generalized Linear Model framework is developed for the aggregate claims model in the dependent setting using a conditional severity model and marginal frequency model. We find that the pure premium in the dependent aggregate claims model {{is the product of}} a marginal mean frequency, a modified marginal mean severity and a correction term. This dependent modelling approach is then compared with the independent aggregate claims model GLM structure. It is shown that the expected <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>amount</b> derived in the independent model is in fact a special case of the dependent model...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Internal Ratings Based (IRB) {{approach}} {{introduced in}} the Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to estimate not just the probability of default, but also the Loss Given Default (LGD), i. e., {{the proportion of the}} outstanding loan that will be lost {{in the event of a}} default. However, modelling LGD poses substantial challenges. One of the key problems in building regression models for estimating the loan-level LGD in retail portfolios such as mortgage loans relates to the difficulty of modelling their distributions, as they typically contain extensive numbers of zeroes. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed where a mixed discrete-continuous model for the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>amount</b> incurred on a defaulted loan is developed. The model accommodates the probability of a zero loss and the loss amount given that a loss occurs simultaneously. The approach is applied to a large dataset of defaulted home mortgages from a UK bank and compared to two well-known industry approaches. Our zero-adjusted gamma model is shown to present an alternative and competitive approach to LGD modelling...|$|E
40|$|E. Franckx [1] has {{established}} the distribution {{function of the}} largest individual claim of a portfolio. By assuming the number of claims to be Poisson distributed, H. Ammeter was able to develop the distribution function of the total loss excluding the largest individual claim [2] {{as well as the}} distribution function of the n th largest claim [3]. Of course, the n th largest claim is dependent on the largest claim, second largest claim and so on, down to the (n th — 1) largest claim. If we assume the number of claims to be Poisson distributed and the amount of the individual claim to be Pareto distributed, the correlation between the m th largest and the n th largest claim can be expressed by an analytical formula which is susceptible to numerical computation. With this knowledge we shall be able to compute the variance of the sum of the n largest claims and moreover the correlation between the sum of the n largest claims and the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>amount.</b> Although an excess of loss reinsurance treaty and a treaty reinsuring the n largest claims are very different in their construction, this paper will show that from a practical point of view there exists a similarity between the two treaties. The correlation coefficient between the sum of the n largest claims and the sum of all claims exceeding a certain limit enables us to assess the degree of similarity. The correlation coefficient and thus the degree of similarity will prove to be high even in case of the reinsurance of {{only a small number of}} largest claims. Finally, the knowledge of the two first moments of the sum of the n largest claims allows us to compute the premium and the security or variance loading for the reinsurance of the n largest claim...|$|E
40|$|The three {{papers in}} this thesis {{comprise}} the development of three types of Basel models – a Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) model for consumer credit risk, using mixture model methods. Mixture models consider the underlying population as being composed of different sub-populations that are modelled separately. In the first paper (Chapter 2), mixture cure models are introduced {{to the area of}} PD/credit scoring. A large proportion of the dataset may not experience the event of interest during the loan term, i. e. default. A mixture cure model predicting (time to) default on a UK personal loan portfolio was developed and its performance compared to industry standard models. The mixture cure model's ability to distinguish between two subpopulations can offer additional insights by estimating the parameters that determine susceptibility to default in addition to parameters that influence time to default of a borrower. The second paper (Chapter 3) considers LGD modelling. One of the key problems in building regression models to estimate loan-level LGD in retail portfolios such as mortgage loans relates to the difficulty in modelling its distribution, which typically contains an extensive amount of zeroes. An alternative approach is proposed in which a mixed discrete-continuous model for the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> <b>amount</b> incurred on a defaulted loan is developed. The model simultaneously accommodates the probability of zero loss and the loss amount given that loss occurs. This zero-adjusted gamma model is shown to present an alternative and competitive approach to LGD modelling. The third paper (Chapter 4) considers EAD models for revolving credit facilities with variable exposure. The credit conversion factor (CCF), the proportion of the current undrawn amount that will be drawn down at time of default, is used to calculate the EAD and poses modelling challenges with challenging bimodal distributions. We explore alternative EAD models which ignore the CCF formulation and target the EAD distribution directly. We propose a mixture model with the zero-adjusted gamma distribution and compare performance with CCF based models. We find the mixture model to be more accurate in calibration than the CCF models and that segmented approaches offer further performance improvements...|$|E
