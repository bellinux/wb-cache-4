500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down. The kick was {{returned}} to the Tech 39-yard line, where the Hokies' offense started with 31 seconds remaining in the quarter. On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could have made that catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a lot out of us." [...] After Still's dropped pass, DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee. The kick was caught by near the Tennessee 10-yard line, and returned {{all the way to the}} Virginia Tech 37-yard line. At the end of the third quarter, Tennessee still led, 3516.|$|E
2500|$|Shonda Rhimes noted Washington's {{commitment}} to his role, revealing that he learns all his surgeries before he performs them on television. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stopped at an accident on the street, he'd {{know exactly what}} to do. He has pulled shifts at hospitals where he follows the surgeons around for 48 hours". At the beginning of the series, Burke is one of the three African american characters, along with Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
6000|$|... 'What Smith {{wants to}} know,' said Mike, 'is whether Rossiter has any hobby of any kind. <b>He</b> <b>thinks,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has, he might work {{it to keep}} in with him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The good, <b>he</b> <b>thinks,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has patience--not too much--may be to come. He doesn't {{know what}} he has done to her. Only we, you see, do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was only}} Ivinghoe, mamma, and I'm sure I don't care what <b>he</b> <b>thinks,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could talk {{of his father}} in that way. Isn't it what you call metallical--no--ironical?' ...|$|R
2500|$|On Jean Renoir, he said: [...] "I think Renoir is {{the only}} filmmaker who's {{practically}} infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt {{with all sorts of}} subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
