25|$|Unions have {{recently}} been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects. <b>They</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.|$|E
2500|$|This is an {{exciting}} portion of the race for dogs and musher, as {{it is one of}} the few portions of the race where there are spectators, and the only spot where the trail winds through an urban environment. However, in [...] "Iditarod Dreams", DeeDee Jonrowe wrote, [...] "A lot of mushers hate the Anchorage start. They don't like crowds. <b>They</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> their dogs get too excited and jumpy. The time for covering this portion of the race does not count toward the official race time, so the dogs, musher, and Idita-Rider are free to take this all in at a relaxed pace. The mushers then continue through several miles of city streets and city trails before reaching the foothills to the east of Anchorage, in Chugach State Park in the Chugach Mountains. The teams then follow Glenn Highway for two to three hours until they reach Eagle River, [...] away. Once they arrive at the Veterans of Foreign Wars building, the mushers check in, unharness their teams, return them to their boxes, and drive [...] of highway to the restart point.|$|E
50|$|The American Egg Board had {{an issue}} with the PSA because they didn't want their product {{associated}} with the unhealthiness of drug use. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> young children might misinterpret the TV message and think that eggs were harmful.|$|R
50|$|Other scholars, like Niall Ferguson, {{think that}} German conservatives were {{ambivalent}} about {{a war and}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> losing a war would have disastrous consequences and that even a successful war might alienate the population if it was long or difficult.|$|R
50|$|Phillippo {{returned}} to Jamaica in 1834, joining with missionaries William Knibb and Thomas Burchell. Together they worked {{to further the}} establishment of a free Negro peasantry {{at the end of the}} Apprenticeship period. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the planters intended to use coercion against the freedmen as the basic means of control.|$|R
2500|$|Nonetheless, Eric Olson, a U.S.-Mexico {{security}} co-operation scholar {{from the}} Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, advocates a similar {{strategy for the}} reduction of violence. Olson acknowledged {{that the government should}} slow down its attacks against cartels that are less violent than others, and focus on Mexico's [...] "biggest problem, the violence that is terrorizing the population and undermining the legitimacy of the state." [...] Olson said that crime will always exist, but one can make it less harmful by getting it out of people's lives as much as possible. He concluded by saying that this proposal is not a [...] "de facto negotiation" [...] with the cartels—but rather a question of what comes first. Some U.S. officials, however, are concerned that Peña Nieto's strategy will mean the return to the old and corrupt practices of the PRI regime, where the government made deals and turned a blind eye on the cartels in exchange for peace. After all, <b>they</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> Mexico's drug war, which has cost over 50,000 lives, will make Mexicans question on why they should [...] "pay the price for a US drug habit." [...] Peña Nieto denies, however, that his party will tolerate corruption and stated he will not make deals with the cartels. On 1 July 2012, the day of the election, the president-elect said the following: ...|$|E

50|$|Incensed by O'Banion's murder, Alterie {{publicly}} challenged his killers to {{a shootout}} on State Street. However, cooler heads within the North Side Gang were upset by Alterie's bravado; <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> this {{would result in}} unwanted attention from both rival gangs and Chicago officials. Moran convinced Alterie to leave Chicago until {{it was safe to}} return.|$|R
50|$|Unlike in {{the rest}} of the Americas, in Cuba the European-descended elite did not form an anti-colonial {{movement}} for most of the 19th century. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> such action would encourage the slaves to form their own revolution and were dependent on their labor at the plantations. Cuba did not gain its independence from Spain until 1898.|$|R
50|$|Like the Missouria, the Osage {{were opposed}} to having Du Tisne pass through their {{territory}} to the villages of the Pawnee. Most of all <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the French would sell guns to the Pawnee. Finally, after extensive negotiations in which Du Tisne resorted to threats that the French would suspend trade relations, {{he was allowed to}} continue. He was permitted to take three guns for himself, three guns for his interpreter, and trade goods.|$|R

50|$|Throughout the novel, {{the moral}} {{conflict}} is mirrored in {{the troubles of}} Axl and Beatrice's relationship.

50|$|On 12 November 2002, Resident Evil Zero was released. Gaming site gamefront.de {{reported}} that 138,855 {{copies of the}} game were sold on its first day of release. Capcom expected Resident Evil Zero to sell 1.42 million copies, but sold only 1.12 million. The fact that Resident Evil Zero did not match or surpass the remake's sales figures, spread fear among Capcom executives and share holders. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> Resident Evil 4 would not sell well enough on GameCube.|$|R
5000|$|During the American {{occupation}} of Amami, the Japanese government objected to them being included {{under the name}} [...] "Ryukyu" [...] in English, because <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> this might mean that {{the return of the}} Amami Islands to Japanese control would be delayed until the return of Okinawa.

50|$|A {{large group}} of Irish {{families}} settled in an area close to Brookline Village known as The Marsh. The Brookline elite worried about the influx of Irishmen into this previously rather homogeneous community. First and foremost, <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> about the impoverished shanties populated by Irish Roman Catholics, a group which suffered severe discrimination during this era. Moreover, <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> their impoverished living conditions in a swampy district would spread disease. In the end, though, the local population had to accept that the influx of lower class families was necessary for any wealthy town's economic well-being.|$|R

50|$|An issue more {{significant}} than the galling daily insults was that many New Mexican citizens feared that their land titles, issued by the Mexican government, would not be recognized by the United States. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> American sympathizers would prosper at their expense. Following Kearny's departure, dissenters in Santa Fe plotted a Christmas uprising. When the plans were discovered by the US authorities, the dissenters postponed the uprising. They attracted numerous Native American allies, including Puebloan peoples, who also wanted to push the Americans from the territory.|$|R
50|$|After the Anson by-election, {{the left-wing}} camp planned to oust Lee Kuan Yew {{from the party}} but <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> their actions would cause the British to hold up plans for Singapore’s independence. As a result, the left-wingers {{had a meeting with}} Lord Selkirk, the British Commissioner-General at Eden Hall, which was later known as the “Eden Hall Tea Party”. At the meeting, the left got {{assurance}} from Selkirk that Britain was committed to independence and would not intervene militarily to maintain control after the overthrow of Lee Kuan Yew’s government.|$|R
50|$|The {{return of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} {{to take up}} permanent residence in their homes, or alternatively, if their homes had been destroyed or occupied by Jewish immigrants, {{to take up residence}} among still extant Arab communities, was seen as a major problem by the Israeli authorities. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> such a return of refugees may reverse the effect of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 war, which had created a Jewish majority within the borders of Israel and opened up massive amounts of formally Arab owned land for Jewish settlement.|$|R
50|$|In early 2007, school {{officials}} said <b>they</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> a child might be seriously injured {{in an accident}} involving the school's many large glass windows, {{some of which are}} floor-to-ceiling and not shatter-resistant. The windows of the building, which was constructed in 1963, are often made of single panes of glass instead of more modern double- or triple-panes that insulate better. A few years before 2007, a student leaning back in his chair accidentally struck a window pane which then shattered.|$|E

50|$|Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) {{decide to}} take Haley (Sarah Hyland) out for a dinner so they can discuss her future. <b>They</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> {{she does not know}} or have any plan about her future, and they decide {{that it is time to}} get her to make plans. Haley deduces their {{intentions}} and why they asked her out and reveals that she has already become a semi-successful photo blogger. Things then get reversed when she asks them what are their plans for the future when all three of them (Alex (Ariel Winter), Luke (Nolan Gould), and herself) leave the house.|$|E
50|$|When Coughlin was {{dismissed}} by the Jaguars after the 2002 season, {{there was concern}} {{for the future of}} the Jay Fund by several physicians at Wolfson Children's Hospital and Nemours Children's Clinic. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> with the departure of the high profile coach, corporate sponsors might shift their support to other causes. After he was hired as head coach of the New York Giants, Coughlin allayed those fears by pledging continued support for the fund and promising to keep the foundation in Jacksonville. Contributions actually increased in Jacksonville.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} some concern {{about the lack of}} gender {{equality}} in the causes supported by Comic Relief, with much funding going to politicised women's charities or charities focusing on females. Writing in The Spectator Ross Clark raised the question, [...] "why do all these women's charities ... feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public?" [...] He added, [...] "are <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1887, {{there were}} two towns {{by the name of}} Richland in Tennessee. This caused concern for the L&N railroad. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> a {{telegraph}} mix-up might result in a train wreck. It also became an extreme inconvenience to postal customers since the mail was frequently misdirected between the two Richlands. It was later decided by the Railroad administrators and the postal authorities that Richland would be renamed Portland to avoid this confusion. The new name was taken into effect on April 10, 1888. Portland was incorporated in April 1904 by legislation passed by the Tennessee Assembly.|$|R

The ship's crew establishes a {{community on the}} island and they begin to try to conceive children to continue civilization. An archival project is started, where everyone is encouraged to write out any knowledge for future generations. They work out a system to allow genetic diversity with anonymous fatherhood, with the women always in strict control. However, no pregnancies occur. <b>They</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> the radiation of the nuclear winter may have rendered everyone sterile.|$|E
50|$|Stone is {{approached}} {{again by}} Cissy, the former Mrs. Hathaway, who suggests {{she is still}} interested in an uncomplicated sexual relationship. Based on his friendship with Hathaway, Stone refuses her overture. Since being released from prison, Hathaway opened a used car dealership, and Stone suspects he may have some mob financing. Hathaway tells Stone the town council is planning on firing the suspended chief, and <b>they</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> he corrupted Suitcase and Rose, and plan to fire them, too. Stone tells Suitcase and Rose. The last scene shows them at the hearing with the town council, awaiting their fate.|$|E
5000|$|The National Council for Disabilities had {{reservations}} {{about how the}} regulations of NCLB fit with those of IDEA. One concern is how schools can effectively intervene and develop strategies when NCLB calls for group accountability rather than individual student attention. The Individual nature of IDEA is [...] "inconsistent with the group nature of NCLB." [...] <b>They</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> NCLB focuses too much on standardized testing and not enough on the work-based experience necessary for obtaining jobs in the future. Also, NCLB is measured essentially by a single test score, but IDEA calls for various measures of student success.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} plan of industrializing Poland, an extensive settlement for linen and cotton craftsmen was built on the right bank of Narew in 1826. The number of craftsmen increased and workers were trained in new crafts. The town also built two bridges, one permanent. The new route connecting Warsaw and St. Petersburg ran through Ostrołęka. Although the town's citizens were eager and proud {{to take part in the}} November Uprising, <b>they</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> their city, as in every previous war, would be destroyed. However they did not expect that the heaviest fighting would take place on near Ostrołęka.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} why African Americans {{are less likely}} to donate than whites, we surveyed 312 African American and 971 white respondents about brain death, donation, transplantation, and trust in the health care system. Compared to whites, African Americans had lower rates of signing donor cards and were more likely to express mistrust in the health care system. <b>They</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> doctors would not try to save their lives if it was known they were donors and that the rich or famous are more likely to get a transplant. They {{were also more likely to}} be favorable about providing funeral benefits to donor...|$|R
2500|$|Despite its pervasiveness, private tuition {{remains a}} {{controversial}} subject in Singapore. Students generally attend tuition classes {{to improve their}} weak academic performance. Some parents {{send their children to}} such tuition because <b>they</b> are <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> their child would lag behind in class because their classmates have individual tuition themselves, or because <b>they</b> are <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> the teacher does not completely cover the syllabus required for national examinations. Teachers and schools allegedly encouraged weaker students to receive private tuition as well, though the Ministry of Education's official stance is that [...] "Teachers should not recommend tuition to students or parents as a form of learning support". Some students who are doing well academically have had requested to have private tuition to further improve on their grades.|$|R
