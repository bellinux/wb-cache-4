5000|$|Sarcoptes anthracis was {{classified}} by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1901 after first occurrences of infection on Asian <b>Tufted</b> <b>Deers.</b> The parasitic itch mite burrows into skin and causes sarcoptic mange, mostly seen on even-toed ungulates. Pregnant female mites tunnel into the stratum corneum of a host's skin and deposit {{eggs in the}} burrows. Young mites move about on the skin and molt into a [...] "nymphal" [...] stage, hosting Bacillus anthracis in their digestive tract. They act as a vector that carries and transmits anthrax to their hosts causing an infection, which often results in death because the immune system was weakened by scabies before. The high host specificity of the mites is {{held responsible for the}} fact that mostly even-toed ungulates struggled with these consequences. In late 1950s the last foci of infection were reported in semi-domesticated reindeers after which no greater incidences were observed.|$|R

50|$|Kingdom of the Apes is {{also home}} to a number of other animals {{including}} dholes, <b>tufted</b> <b>deer,</b> Nyala and further species of lemur including crowned lemurs and ring-tailed lemurs.|$|E
5000|$|Water deer, <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> and muntjacs {{are small}} deer with long upper canines that {{protrude}} like tusks. Muntjacs {{are known for}} their soft hide and tender meat. The Indian muntjac is found throughout southern China. The range of the Reeve's muntjac extends north to Gansu and to Taiwan. Fea's muntjac are found in eastern Tibet and the Gongshan muntjac in neighboring Yunnan. The hairy-fronted muntjac is endemic to the mountains at the juncture of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian and is a protected species. The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer,</b> a close relative of the muntjac, is found throughout central China.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> {{is found}} mainly in China, where {{it occurs in}} the south from eastern coast to eastern Tibet. It is absent from the extreme south of the country. There are old records of this species in northeastern Myanmar, but recent surveys failed to find any, {{possibly}} {{due to the lack}} of surveys on the preferred habitat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> {{is a small}} deer, {{but still}} larger than most muntjac species. It stands at 50 - 70 cm at the shoulder, and the weight varies from 17 to 30 kg. The tail is short at around 10 cm. The antler is only present in males and is {{extremely}} short, almost hidden by its long tuft of hair.|$|E
50|$|Asian Falls {{was opened}} in 1992, and {{includes}} the Asian elephant complex. Once past the elephants, visitors can observe the animals from a boardwalk {{that gives a}} bird's-eye view of rhinos and takes them past other animals including the zoo's white tigers, Malayan tigers, {{and a pair of}} striped hyenas as well as hoofstock that are endemic to Asia including <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> and anoa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> {{is mainly}} solitary or found in pairs. It is crepuscular and travels in fixed routes about its territory, which is vigorously defended by the males. It is a timid animal and prefer places with good cover, {{where it is}} well camouflaged. It can be easily {{disturbed}} and, when alarmed, it will let out a bark before fleeing, moving in cat-like jumps.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> inhabits high, damp forests at 500 - 4500 m {{above sea}} level, {{close to the}} tree line. It is found in both {{evergreen}} and deciduous forests with extensive understory and nearby freshwater supply. The availability of salt licks is also a positive factor {{to the presence of}} this animal. This deer is able to withstand minor human disturbances, and is occasionally found in cultivated lands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> {{is similar}} to a muntjac in appearance, but the longer necks and legs give it a {{slightly}} leaner appearance. The coat is coarse with short and stiff hairs, being almost black in the winter and chocolate brown in the summer. The lips, tip of the ears, and the underside of the tails are white. A tuft of horseshoe-shaped hair is present on the forehead and upper neck, being brown to black, and can be up to 17 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> (Elaphodus cephalophus) {{is a small}} {{species of}} deer {{characterized}} by a prominent tuft of black hair on its forehead and fang-like canines for the males. It is a close relative of the muntjac, living somewhat further north over a wide area of central China northeastern Myanmar. Suffering from overhunting and habitat loss, this deer is considered near-threatened. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Elaphodus. It is restricted to forested mountain habitat up to 4500 m above sea level, making study difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, Asiatic golden cats, red pandas, hog badgers and yellow-throated martens. Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|E
5000|$|Most deer bear 32 teeth; the {{corresponding}} dental formula is: [...] The elk and the reindeer may be exceptions, {{as they may}} retain their upper canines and thus have 34 teeth (dental formula: [...] ). The Chinese water deer, <b>tufted</b> <b>deer,</b> and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks, while other species often lack upper canines altogether. The cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel, which enable them to grind {{a wide variety of}} vegetation. The teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation, and like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors, instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw.|$|E
50|$|Coat colour {{generally}} varies between red and brown, {{though it}} can be as dark as chocolate brown in the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> or have a grayish tinge as in elk. Different species of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour. Several species such as the chital, the fallow deer and the sika deer feature white spots on a brown coat. Coat of reindeer shows notable geographical variation. Deer undergo two moults in a year; for instance, in red deer the red, thin-haired summer coat is gradually replaced by the dense, greyish brown winter coat in autumn, which in turn gives way to the summer coat in the following spring. Moulting is affected by the photoperiod.|$|E
50|$|A {{study at}} Wolong Reserve in China {{demonstrated}} {{variation in the}} leopards' diet over time; {{over the course of}} seven years, the vegetative cover receded, and the animals opportunistically shifted from primarily consuming <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> to pursuing bamboo rats and other smaller prey. A study estimated average daily consumption rates at 3.5 kg for males and 2.8 kg for females. A study of leopards in the southern Kalahari showed that water requirements are met by the bodily fluids of the prey, succulent plants and water bodies; they drink water every two to three days, and feed infrequently on moisture-rich plants such as gemsbok cucumbers (Acanthosicyos naudinianus), tsamma melon (Citrullus lanatus) and Kalahari sour grass (Schmidtia kalahariensis). A few instances of cannibalism have been reported.|$|E
50|$|The Cervinae {{emerged as}} {{the first group of}} extant cervids around 7-9 Mya, during the late Miocene in central Asia. The tribe Muntiacini made its {{appearance}} as † Muntiacus leilaoensis around 7-8 Mya; The early muntjacs varied in size-as small as hares or as large as fallow deer. They had tusks for fighting and antlers for defence. Capreolinae followed soon after; Alceini appeared 6.4-8.4 Mya. Around this period, the Tethys Ocean disappeared to give way to vast stretches of grassland; these provided the deer with abundant protein-rich vegetation that {{led to the development of}} ornamental antlers and allowed populations to flourish and colonise areas. As antlers had become pronounced, the canines were no more retained or were poorly represented (as in elk), probably because diet was no more browse-dominated and antlers were better display organs. In muntjac and <b>tufted</b> <b>deer,</b> the antlers as well as the canines are small. The tragulids, however, possess long canines to this day.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Trail {{has been}} home to many types of animals over the years; and recently, the area was renovated to center around the return of tigers to the Kansas City Zoo, and its native Asia. The entire trek is filled with oriental plants, lanterns, statues, and various {{pictures}} of Asian animals. The Francois langur is featured in the first enclosure. The path leads to a tunnel with Bali mynah and red panda. The langurs and the pandas swap exhibits according to outdoor conditions (pandas are outside in fall and winter, while in tunnel during spring and summer). The {{focal point of the}} Tiger Trail is the critically endangered Sumatran tiger exhibit, which is home to two male tigers. Other animals on exhibit are the, wreathed hornbill, demoiselle crane, and the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer.</b> Near the former ape house, Asian waterfowl, such as red-crowned crane, Mandarin duck, and common shelduck can be viewed in a wetlands exhibit.|$|E
50|$|The {{fallow deer}} {{and the various}} {{subspecies}} of the reindeer have the largest {{as well as the}} heaviest antlers, both in absolute terms as well as in proportion to body mass (an average of 8 g per kilogram of body mass); the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer,</b> on the other hand, has the smallest antlers of all deer, while the pudú has the lightest antlers with respect to body mass (0.6 g per kilogram of body mass). The structure of antlers show considerable variation; while fallow deer and elk antlers are palmate (with a broad central portion), white-tailed deer antlers include a series of tines sprouting upward from a forward-curving main beam, and those of the pudú are mere spikes. Antler development begins from the pedicel, a bony structure that appears {{on the top of the}} skull by the time the animal is a year old. The pedicel gives rise to a spiky antler the following year, that is replaced by a branched antler in the third year. This process of losing a set of antlers to develop a larger and more branched set continues for the rest of the life. The antlers emerge as soft tissues (known as velvet antlers) and progressively harden into bony structures (known as hard antlers), following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessels in the tissue, from the tip to the base.|$|E
40|$|Great rivers were {{generally}} {{looked at as}} the geographical barrier to gene flow for many taxonomic groups. The Yangtze River is the third largest river in the world, and flows across South China and into the East China Sea. Up until now, {{few studies have been}} carried out to evaluate its effect as a geographical barrier. In this study, we attempted to determine the barrier effect of the Yangtze River on the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> (Elaphodus cephalophus) using the molecular ecology approach. Using mitochondrial DNA control region (CR) sequences and 13 nuclear microsatellite loci, we explored the genetic structure and gene flow in two adjacent <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> populations (Dabashan and Wulingshan populations), which are separated by the Yangtze River. Results indicated that there are high genetic diversity levels in the two populations, but no distinguishable haplotype group or potential genetic cluster was detected which corresponded to specific geographical population. At the same time, high gene flow was observed between Wulingshan and Dabashan populations. The <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> populations experienced population decrease from 0. 3 to 0. 09 Ma BP, then followed by a distinct population increase. A strong signal of recent population decline (T = 4, 396 years) was detected in the Wulingshan population by a Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressions(MSVAR) process population demography analysis. The results indicated that the Yangtze River may not act as an effective barrier to gene flow in the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer.</b> Finally, we surmised that the population demography of the <b>tufted</b> <b>deer</b> was likely affected by Pleistocene climate fluctuations and ancient human activities...|$|E
