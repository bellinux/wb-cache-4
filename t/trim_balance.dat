40|$|High {{speed drive}} shafts are {{traditionally}} balanced using <b>trim</b> <b>balance</b> weights {{applied to the}} shaft ends. This paper considers the development and theoretical analysis of a novel and alternative strategy of balancing long flexible coupling shafts, whereby the trim balancing weights are applied by the means {{of a pair of}} 'Balancing Sleeve' arms that are integrally attached to each end of the coupling shaft. The <b>trim</b> <b>balance</b> weights are intended to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the coupling shaft in order to limit shaft end reaction forces. With increasing speed, the magnitude of the corrective force also increases due to the flexibility of the balance sleeve. This thereby counteracts the increased coupling shaft unbalance resulting from its own flexibility. Additionally, it is also found that the mechanism imparts a corrective bending moment to the coupling shaft ends, which has a tendency to limit deflection. The methodology is modelled as a rotating simply supported shaft with uniform eccentricity and allows application to the problem of drivetrain balancing of sub- 15 MW industrial gas turbines. Results show that reaction loads can theoretically be reduced from 10, 000 N to approximately zero. The bending moment applied to the shaft is also shown to reduce shaft deflection theoretically to zero. In practical applications this will be unrealistic and achievable results show deflection theoretically reduced by half. Analysis of the balance sleeve feasibility is considered through use of a three-dimensional finite element model. Further to this paper, the aim is to develop a full dynamic model of both shaft and counterbalance sleeve, with verification coming from scaled, experimental test facilities.

Whilst carrying out certain flight exercises, a lot of trim could be required to maintain the desired angle of attack.

Elevator trim is correlated {{with the speed of}} the airflow over the tail, thus airspeed changes to the aircraft require re-trimming.

The motor driving a centrifugal compressor providing process air is decoupled during startup from a gearbox and steam turbine by a clutch. Steam generated by waste heat from the process drives the turbine under normal operation and the synchronizing clutch is engaged, reducing the motor load requirements. Excessive running speed (1 x) lateral vibrations came to light when the motor was run solo during field commissioning. Extreme sensitivity to small <b>trim</b> <b>balance</b> weight changes on the exciter end led to extensive field tests to identify {{the source of the}} problem. Rotordynarnic analyses and coupled running tests confirmed an overhang resonance, and revealed the only possible short term solution to be the addition of a third bearing on the motor shaft to control the overhang mode. Field installation of a 14 inch diameter tilting pad bearing, located on the clutch hub at the motor shaft end, was completed quickly to allow plant startup to proceed. In situ machining of the hub on the shaft, while the motor remained installed in the field, was required to assure proper journal shape and rapid project completion.

40|$|The paper furthers the {{analysis}} of a recently proposed balancing methodology for high-speed, flexible shafts. This mechanism imparts corrective balancing moments, having the effect of simulating the fixing moments of equivalent double or single encastre mounted shafts. This is shown to theoretically eliminate/nullify the 1 st lateral critical speed (LCS), and thereby facilitate safe operation with reduced LCS margins. The paper extends previously reported research to encompass a more generalised case of multiple, concentrated, residual imbalances, thereby facilitating analysis of any imbalance distribution along the shaft. Solutions provide greater insight of the behaviour of the balancing sleeve concept, and the beneficial implications for engineering design. Specifically: 1) a series of concentrated imbalances {{can be regarded as}} an equivalent level of uniform eccentricity, and balance sleeve compensation is equally applicable to a generalised unbalanced distribution, 2) compensation depends on the sum of the applied balancing sleeve moments and can therefore be achieved using a single balancing sleeve (thereby simulating a single encastre shaft), 3) compensation of the 2 nd critical speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} higher orders, is possible by use of two balancing sleeves, positioned at shaft ends, 4) the concept facilitates on-site commissioning of <b>trim</b> <b>balance</b> which requires a means of adjustment at only one end of the shaft, 5) the Reaction Ratio, RR, (simply supported/ encastre), is independent of residual eccentricity, so that the implied benefits resulting from the ratio (possible reductions in the equivalent level of eccentricity) are additional to any balancing procedures undertaken prior to encastre simulation. Analysis shows that equivalent reductions in the order of 1 / 25 th, are possible.

40|$|No. 2606 * Surnrnary. [...] Oscillation of control-surface tabs has {{occurred}} in flight. General experience and the investigations of this report suggest that the oscillations were flutter, involving translation of the tab, arising from bending of the local control-surface structure, coupled with rotation of the tab about its hinge, arising from either backlash or elasticity of the tab controlling me&anism. Binary flutter calculations show that, for this coupling, the normal remedy, i. e. mass-balancing, is only partially effective (static mass-balancing roughly doubles the backlash flutter speed but may decrease the elastic flutter speed). If the tab controlling mechanism is adequately stiff, elimination of backlash gives higher flutter speeds than would be obtained by mass-balancing alone and in practice probably removes the danger of flutter. Flutter is completely prevented by aerodynamically balancing and dynamically mass-balancing (e. G. on hinge line) the tab. 1. I~troductio~. [...] 1. 1.

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 76 This paper {{describes}} the design modifications and active balancing on a 19, 000 hp integrally forged steam turbine rotor {{to improve its}} dynamic characteristics and reliability. The turbine was purchased {{as a replacement for}} an identical turbine used in a syn gas train. Ever since original installation, the turbine had been plagued with high vibration problems on the coupling end, excessive bearing temperatures, and reduced coupling life. A rotordynamic analysis proved that there was sufficient separation margin between the turbine's operating speed and any critical speed. However, at operating speed, the rotor had a high vibration response at the coupling, even with a very small unbalance. A design modification was thus incorporated on the rotor to make it less sensitive to unbalance. At operating speed, this modification lowered the predicted coupling end shaft deflection to approximately a third of its original value. An active balancer was then assembled on the rotor to provide the flexibility of online <b>trim</b> <b>balancing.</b> The replacement turbine has been installed and is operating with the lowest vibration and bearing temperatures in the compressor train's history.

All the magazines before him were for the month of January, and though it was possible that they might have shown a certain exhaustion from their extraordinary efforts in their Christmas numbers, still there was a chance of the overflow of riches from those numbers which would <b>trim</b> the <b>balance</b> and give them at least the average poetic value. At this point, however, it ought to be confessed that the poet, or critic, was never so willing a reader as writer of occasional verse, and it cannot be denied that there was some girding up of the loins for him before the grapple with that half-hundred of magazines. Though he took them at their weakest point, might they not be too much for him? ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of German future space {{transportation}} technology and research program ASTRA a concept of a reusable winged liquid fly-back booster (LFBB) is under investigation. It has two booster stages attached to the expendable Ariane 5 core stage. During {{the first phase of}} the study several empirical and numerical analysis methods were used with respect to the configuration definition. The subsequent design loop required a more detailed investigation including wind tunnel measurements along the complete trajectory from separation at hypersonic speeds down to the subsonic fly-back cruise regime. Tests were performed not only creating a complete aerodynamic data set for <b>trim</b> and <b>balance</b> in longitudinal motion but also achieving a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the flow field of this vehicle including the influence between the canards and the wing. Measurements were carried out in the DLR trisonic wind tunnel TMK (0. 5 < Ma < 4) and the hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K (Ma = 6. 0 and Ma = 7. 0). The model angle of attack was varied from - 2 ° to + 8 ° and from - 2 ° to + 38 ° in TMK and H 2 K respectively. The angle of side slip was varied between 0 ° and 5 °...|$|R
