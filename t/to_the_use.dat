5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{use a variety}} of gadgets to pursue and capture the apes, {{traversing}} across several environments. The game's controls are heavily centred around the analog sticks, being the first game to require the use of the PlayStation's DualShock. Development of Ape Escape lasted over two years, and was generally focused on adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the controller, which was a significant challenge for the development team.|$|E

In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines.

5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.

5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers were opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.

The fire training area also needed clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E
