5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune <b>to</b> <b>disease</b> and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity <b>to</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who died of battle wounds, three {{officers}} and 12 enlisted men succumbed <b>to</b> <b>disease,</b> including its second colonel, Noah Farnham, who {{died as a result}} of his wounds sustained at Bull Run and a bout of typhoid.

5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death.

5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk, or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible <b>to</b> <b>disease.</b> The Fiji species, despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group, appears to be stable in numbers.

5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed <b>to</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>disease.</b> Exhibition standards {{had led to}} selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{its three}} years of service, the 21st Massachusetts had been reduced from 1,000 men to fewer than 100. Of these losses, 152 were killed in action or died from wounds {{received}} in action, approximately 400 were discharged due to wounds, 69 were taken prisoner, and approximately 300 were discharged due <b>to</b> <b>disease,</b> resignation, or desertion.

He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed <b>to</b> <b>disease.</b> With the permission of Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>disease</b> and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 18th Century, French traders first began {{trade with the}} Akokisa and the nearby Bidai tribes for furs. In 1754 several traders {{including}} Joseph Blancpain established a trading post on the Trinity River a {{just north of the}} bay, near modern Wallisville. Spanish authorities quickly seized the post and transformed it into the San Augustín de Ahumada fort. They named the site El Orcoquisac and established a Catholic mission. The Spanish were not successful in maintaining trade with the natives and the post was abandoned within a few years. Encroachment by Spanish as well as U.S. settlers continued such {{that by the end of}} the century native populations had declined dramatically due <b>to</b> <b>disease</b> and territorial pressures from the Europeans.|$|E
