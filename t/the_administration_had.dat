5|$|Edsall's 2012 team {{compiled}} a 4–8 record, losing four quarterbacks to injury, and eventually starting a linebacker at the position. The team's record improved from 2011 nonetheless but still {{not as much}} as fans, alumni and <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> hoped.|$|E
5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell {{to file a}} friendly test case to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} incentive package. While the suit was pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> failed to include the interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed the total cost of the package to about $354million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E
5|$|Guest and Knowles were {{summoned to}} the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. <b>The</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.|$|E
5|$|After Lillehammer {{was awarded}} the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became {{necessary}} to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, {{as part of a}} broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. Originally <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall, after Haakon Haakonarson, later king of Norway, while the smaller hall would be named Sveres Hall, for Sverre Sigurdsson. During the political debate, a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall, for Sigurdsson's daughter Kristina Sverresdotter, which was passed by the city council. Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics. Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years, including an upgrade in 2007 which included new ice hockey sideboards, a new ice machine, a new lighting system, and a new handball floor.|$|E
5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for the melted coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> become {{convinced}} that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration continuously opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They continuously claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to continuously demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{positive}} stories emerging from this phase of election was from Kandhamal district, where refugees of the 2008 Kandhamal riots came out in huge numbers to exercise their franchise. It is estimated {{that there was a}} turnout of 90% amongst Kandhamal refugees and 50% across the entire district. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> earlier identified large parts of the area as naxal affected and vulnerable. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> deployed extra security in the area and the ECI has arranged for special transport to shuttle the refugees from the refugee camps to the polling booths. Both of these actions helped achieve the high turnout.|$|E
25|$|Within the Arctic Council, {{an expert}} group {{was created in}} 2015 {{investigating}} {{the threat posed by}} black carbon to the region which concluded its findings and recommendations in 2016. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> also looked to increase data sharing—a major agenda item at the inaugural White House Arctic Science Ministerial in September 2016.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> been {{interested}} in propping up the Transitional National Government in Mogadishu.

40|$|To {{understand}} the constant increase in administration, {{we need a}} new approach to <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> For many years, <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> intensified as a closed science, associated only with economics, law and political science. However, this approach did not bring anything good, because almost nothing in <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> improved. Therefore, it is necessary to connect <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> with <b>the</b> natural sciences which give the best description of the world around us. Because of this the concept of fractals gives us a good insight primarily why administration tends to increase and why the job in <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of people outside the church seems meaningless, complicated and full of paperwork...|$|R

25|$|Obama later {{referred}} to the Libya intervention when questioned about his worst mistake. Obama asserted {{that he had been}} reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice. Obama cited the lack of preparation <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>had</b> made for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya. However, Clinton's stance is that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{opposes the}} idea of legally prosecuting CIA {{personnel}} who committed waterboarding based upon legal advice provided by superiors. The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized his stance. In early April 2009, news reports stated that Obama would support an independent investigation over the issue {{as long as it}} would be bipartisan. On 23 April 2009, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> changed its position and now opposes such an idea. The topic has been subject to heated internal debate within the White House.|$|E

25|$|In March 2005, three student activists, Katrina Yeaw, Michael Hoffman and Pardis Esmaeili, from San Francisco State University {{received}} letters {{stating that}} <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> received a complaint from the Chief of Public Safety for {{their involvement in}} a counter-recruitment protest on campus and that each student must meet individually with Judicial Affairs. The following week the six student organizations that endorsed the demonstration received letters stating that disciplinary proceedings were going forward against them. The charges against four of the groups and three student activists were eventually dropped but the university went forward with hearing against the International Socialist Organization and Students Against War, convicting both groups of all charges against them in absentia.|$|E
25|$|Also in February 1993, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, {{along with}} several other groups, {{filed a lawsuit against}} Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala over closed-door {{meetings}} related to the health care plan.

Lamberth found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned in 1999 the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> not acted in bad faith.|$|E
