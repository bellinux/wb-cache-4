5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but {{shared a common}} design approach. The {{entry-level}} XT featured a black plastic panel for {{the upper half of}} the dashboard, with either a black, charcoal, or beige panel for <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b> Not all variants offered the distinctive colour palette; the sports variants could not be optioned with the two-tone interior.|$|E
5|$|Its {{dimensions}} are highly symmetrical and proportionate, probably {{influenced by the}} geometric ideals, ratios and rules of design of the ancient Greeks. The balance of measurements, especially between the width and height of the cross, seem derived from the sides and diagonals of squares, and dynamic rectangles. Cimabue was not rigid in his placement, however, and to accommodate the sway of Christ's body, altered the positioning {{of some of the}} boards on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E

To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway down the hill.|$|E

30|$|In the diagonal, {{elements}} are assigned {{the value of}} unity (i.e., when a factor is compared with itself). Since the matrix is symmetrical, only <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> triangular <b>half</b> actually needs to be filled in. The remaining cells are then simply the reciprocals of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> triangular <b>half</b> (for example, because the rating of Temperature relative to Topography is 3, the rating of Topography relative to Temperature will be 1 / 3).|$|R

5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E
5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time.

5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the Navajo Formation.|$|E

5|$|For Nordic skiing, Great Glen Trails {{offers a}} large, groomed trail system that also {{includes}} <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the Auto Road. Several warming huts are scattered around the trail system, including scenic Great Angel Cabin, with views of the Great Gulf and surrounding peaks. Great Glen also permits biking on the trails during the summer, {{and is the only}} mountain bike facility in the notch. Another cross-country trail system exists in the town of Jackson, extending as far as the summit of Wildcat Mountain.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} professional tournament in the 1970s, the English entrants were either First Division or Second Division sides. (The First Division sides had generally finished in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the table, while the Second Division sides were generally mid-table or better.) With {{the exception of}} Bari and Como in 1973, all Italian teams playing in the 1970s tournament had just competed in the previous Serie A season. The Italian clubs were often mid-table or higher finishers who had sometimes also qualified for the European competitions.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the wheat fields. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>half</b> of the rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
