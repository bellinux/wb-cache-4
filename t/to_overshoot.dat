5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed <b>to</b> <b>overshoot</b> and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low on fuel, broke off and headed north.|$|E

25|$|The {{integral}} term accelerates {{the movement}} of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller.

25|$|While {{steering}} {{into the}} skid (away from the pursuing vehicle) will reduce its effect, {{the fact that}} the pursuing car is continuing to push the rear of the target sideways virtually ensures loss of control of the targeted vehicle. By moving forward out of position, or by staying squarely in front of the PIT unit the lead vehicle can disallow the PIT unit from gaining proper positioning to conduct the maneuver. Alternatively, rapid deceleration will, of course, force the PIT unit <b>to</b> <b>overshoot</b> the required positioning.|$|E
25|$|The plane had, by {{contemporary}} standards, a high wing loading (294.0kg/m2, 60.2lbs/ft2) that required higher takeoff and landing speeds. Due to poor throttle response, the engines' tendency for airflow disruption {{that could cause}} the compressor to stall was ubiquitous. The high speed of the Me 262 also presented problems when engaging enemy aircraft, the high-speed convergence allowing Me 262 pilots little time to line up their targets or acquire the appropriate amount of deflection. This problem faces any aircraft that approaches another from behind at much higher speed, as the slower aircraft in front can always pull a tighter turn, forcing the faster aircraft <b>to</b> <b>overshoot.</b>|$|E

50|$|Despite being a {{technical}} {{improvement over the}} VL3, the small size and compact design of the VL4 led {{to a number of}} reliability issues—particularly with overheating. The densely constructed and relatively front-heavy head of the luminaire was also prone <b>to</b> <b>overshooting</b> (and then bouncing back to) its intended position at the end of fast movements. Many problems were addressed in a major upgrade programme, carried out over several weeks in the early 1990s, which featured over 135 modifications to the design. These ranged from the simple placement of a blob of rubber sealant somewhere in the luminaire, to the wholesale stripping down, extensive modification and total rebuilding of the Pan and Tilt mechanisms, <b>to</b> combat the <b>overshooting</b> problem.|$|R
25|$|In March 2003, the Lynx {{formed the}} bulk of the {{deployed}} British rotary aviation battle group in the invasion of Iraq. Participating aircraft were quickly outfitted with engine sand filters, armour, heat dissipaters, modern secure radios and radar warning receivers. In the subsequent multi-national occupation force, a flight of either AAC or CHF Lynx AH.7s were based at Basra International Airport under command of the Joint Helicopter Force (Iraq) on a rotational basis. In theatre, they would escort infantry patrols, perform aerial reconnaissance, provide fire support and act as airborne communications hubs. Performance issues were encountered in the high temperature environment, often operating with no power reserve and thus no ability <b>to</b> <b>overshoot</b> during landings; these were belatedly resolved by the introduction of the Lynx AH.9A.|$|E
25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead <b>to</b> <b>overshoot.</b> After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.|$|E

40|$|Helioseismic {{investigation}} has suggested {{to apply the}} turbulent convection models (TCMs) <b>to</b> the convective <b>overshooting.</b> Using the turbulent velocity in the overshooting region determined by the TCM, one {{can deal with the}} overshooting mixing as a diffusion process, which leads to incomplete mixing. It has been found that this treatment can improve the solar sound speed and the Li depletion in open clusters. In order to investigate whether the TCM can be applied <b>to</b> the <b>overshooting</b> mixing outside the stellar convective core, new observations of the eclipsing binary star HY Vir are adopted <b>to</b> calibrate the <b>overshooting</b> mixing parameter. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) the TCM parameters and the overshooting mixing parameter in the solar case are also suitable for the eclipsing binary system HY Vir; (ii) the incomplete mixing results in a continuous profile of the hydrogen abundance; (iii) the e-folding length of the region, in which the hydrogen abundance changes due <b>to</b> the <b>overshooting</b> mixing, increases during the stellar evolution.

The order to shoot KAL007 down was given as {{it was about to}} leave Soviet airspace for the second time. At around 18:26UTC, under pressure from General Kornukov, and ground controllers not to let the aircraft escape into international airspace, the lead fighter was able to move back into a position where it could fire two K-8 (NATO reporting name: AA-3 [...] "Anab") air-to-air missiles at the plane.|$|E
500|$|It was {{following}} No.234 Squadron's move to Middle Wallop that Hughes began to score heavily against German fighters.

Bird was in seventh but was challenged by Ceccon who put his car on the line entering the Novelle Chicane forcing Bird <b>to</b> <b>overshoot</b> the corner to avoid colliding with him. Bird was aware that his move would entail a drive-through penalty and thus yielded seventh place to Ceccon. Bird was immediately attacked by Richelmi but it became evident that Bird's car was suffering from a major problem. Bird lost further positions before entering the pit lane for technical assistance that put him one lap behind the race leader. He thus set the fastest lap of the race on supersoft tyres but as he was outside of the top ten he did not score the point entailed by the achievement.

500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled up above the enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers <b>to</b> <b>overshoot</b> their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats.

30|$|The actual {{magnitude}} of the fall in consumption depends on fiscal policy. If fiscal policy is contractionary in the transition period, this will further increase the share of burden {{of the financial crisis}} that is put on the shoulders of current generations. They will reduce their consumption even further, requiring an even larger shift of employment to the export industry. Instead, the government can provide intergenerational insurance by adopting an offsetting expansionary fiscal policy, shifting part of the burden of adjustment to future generations. Lack of intergenerational insurance will lead <b>to</b> <b>overshooting</b> in the reallocation of labour between industries and will therefore increase the loss in specific human capital.
