5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman is doing {{one or the}} other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

While their losses were far smaller {{than those of the}} British, the crews also suffered through bad weather, low-level skill and a high accident rate due to night flying. In {{the first three months of}} 1944, it lost 15% of its crews. The introduction of Mosquito night fighter variants caused problems for the Nachtjagdgeschwader. The Mosquito proved superior in performance to most German night fighters and it is rumoured that German pilots were credited with two kills for shooting one down. Between 1943 and 1945, German night fighters shot down only 50 Mosquito aircraft of all types.|$|E

Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire, the mission was an important test for the Apollo program, and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike. Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander, Wally Schirra, who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground. Although pressed by reporters in news conferences, Lunney stayed diplomatic and said nothing critical of Schirra. Privately, however, he was extremely exasperated, and later assured his team of young controllers that [...] "manned spaceflight is usually better than this". He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would [...] "like to meet <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>or</b> whomever it was, that dreamed up that little gem".

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit.

2500|$|Even though [...] "Arianism" [...] {{might suggest}} that Arius was the {{originator}} of the teaching that bears his name, {{the debate over the}} Son’s precise relationship to the Father did not begin with him. This subject had been discussed for decades before his advent; Arius merely intensified the controversy and carried it to a Church-wide audience, where other [...] "Arians" [...] such as Eusebius of Nicomedia (not to be confused with his contemporary, Eusebius of Caesarea) proved much more influential in the long run. In fact, some later [...] "Arians" [...] disavowed the name, claiming not to have been familiar with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> his specific teachings. However, because the conflict between Arius and his foes brought the issue to the theological forefront, the doctrine he proclaimed—though not originated—is generally labeled as [...] "his".|$|E
2500|$|The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a {{combination}} of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level a married person could be a big winner – getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a [...] "swing" [...] of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender). In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.|$|E

Following Winfrey's success in—and Academy Award and Golden Globe {{nominations}} for—her performance as Sofia in the movie The Color Purple, on September 8, 1986 the talk show was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally. For the premiere, the show's producers tried rigorously to book Miami Vice's Don Johnson as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with Dom Pérignon and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to [...] "do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people".

2500|$|Stephen Greenblatt {{acknowledges}} the convention that the [...] "equivocator" [...] {{arriving at the}} gate of hell in the Porter's speech in Macbeth is {{a reference to the}} Jesuit Father Henry Garnet, who had been executed in 1606. He argues that Shakespeare probably included the allusion for the sake of topicality, trusting that his audience would have heard of Garnet's pamphlet on equivocation, and not from any hidden sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> his cause – indeed the portrait is not a sympathetic one. Literary editor Bishop Warburton declared that in the mind of Jacobean playgoers the policy of equivocation, adopted as an official doctrine of the Jesuits, would have been a direct reminder of Catholic treason in the [...] "Gunpowder plot". Shakespeare may have also been aware of the [...] "equivocation" [...] concept which appeared as the subject of a 1583 tract by Queen Elizabeth's chief councillor Lord Burghley, and the 1584 Doctrine of Equivocation by the Spanish prelate Martin Azpilcueta that was disseminated across Europe and into England in the 1590s.|$|E
2500|$|The Peter Bergmann Case is an unsolved mystery {{pertaining}} {{to the death of}} an unidentified man in County Sligo, Ireland. From 12 to 16 June 2009, a man using the alias [...] "Peter Bergmann" [...] visited the coastal seaport town of Sligo, in northwest Ireland. He used this alias to check into the Sligo City Hotel, where he stayed during the majority of his visit, and was described by the hotel staff and tenants as having a heavy Germanic accent. The man's movements were captured on CCTV throughout the town; however, the details of his actions and intentions remain unknown. His interactions with other people were limited, and little is known of his origins or the reason for his visit to Sligo. On the morning of 16 June, the naked body of the unidentified man was discovered at Rosses Point beach, a popular recreation destination and fishing area near Sligo. Despite having conducted a five-month investigation into the death of [...] "Peter Bergmann", the police were never able to identify <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> develop any leads in the case.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto her elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|E
