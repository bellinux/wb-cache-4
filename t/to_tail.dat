5|$|While {{very large}} by the {{standard}} of modern predators, Daspletosaurus was not the largest tyrannosaurid. Adults could reach a length of 8–9meters (26–30ft) from snout <b>to</b> <b>tail.</b> Mass estimates have centered on 2.5tonnes (2.75short tons) but have ranged between 1.8 and 3.8 tonnes (2.0 and 4.1 short tons).|$|E
5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from head <b>to</b> <b>tail.</b> Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head <b>to</b> <b>tail)</b> wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club {{suffered}} the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, {{it was not enough}} for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, their form began <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> off mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and heavy, with inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} growth of {{industry}} there were not enough good jobs: as a result, from 1841 to 1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the First World War, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. While emigration began <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, 10 per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada, and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-eighteenth century. This contributed to the growth of the population, which reached a peak of 5,240,800 in 1974. Thereafter it began to fall slowly, moving down to 5,062,940 in 2000. There was also a decrease in some urban populations as a result of slum clearance, overspill and relocation to new towns, with the population of Glasgow falling from over a million in 1951 to 629,000 in 2001. Rural areas also saw a loss of population, particularly the Highlands and Hebrides. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century Scotland saw a rise in its population to 5,313,600 (its highest ever recorded) at the 2011 census.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if {{a typical}} coin is tossed and one assumes that it cannot land on its edge, {{then it can}} either land showing [...] "heads" [...] or [...] "tails." [...] Because these two {{outcomes}} are mutually exclusive (i.e. the coin cannot simultaneously show both heads and tails) and collectively exhaustive (i.e. {{there are no other}} possible outcomes not represented between these two), they are therefore each other's complements. This means that heads is logically equivalent <b>to</b> <b>tails,</b> and <b>tails</b> is equivalent <b>to</b> heads.|$|R

5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head <b>to</b> <b>tail,</b> and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E
5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking power steering system, handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing car while behind the safety car, while the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am to the No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{modifications}} {{reduced the}} numbers of Typhoons being lost due <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> assembly failure, {{towards the end of}} the Typhoon's life there were more tail failures, this time caused by a change to the undercarriage latch mechanism in late 1944; in high-speed flight the undercarriage fairings were pulled into the slipstream, creating an uneven airflow over the elevators and rudder resulting in tailplane and then rear fuselage structural failure. In total 25 aircraft were lost and 23 pilots killed due <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> failures.|$|E
