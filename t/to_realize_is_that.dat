[...] After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May, the Braves performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on May 12 which revealed an inflamed rotator cuff but no structural damage. [...] He rested and received a cortisone injection, but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice. [...] The Braves placed him {{on the disabled list}} (DL) on May 22. [...] Public criticism from teammate Chipper Jones for not playing through his injuries followed the next month.

What Jason needs <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jason at 80 percent is a force, and Jason at 80 percent is better than {{a lot of people in}} this league."

2500|$|The {{first thing}} <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pawn {{may be able}} to queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to four by four, and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E

40|$|The {{triumph of}} a {{neoliberal}} economic doctrine in America {{has been accompanied}} by, indeed partly propelled by, a conservative social and moral agenda. The paradox is this - as neoliberalism cuts its swathe through tradition, remaking the social order out of {{the ruins of a}} New Deal consensus, it removes the material conditions that can sustain social and moral conservatism. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Supreme Court recently upheld the doctrine of privacy in Lawrence vs. Texas and effectively challenged state laws banning sodomy. In a dissenting decision, Justice Antonin Scalia warned that the Court had taken the wrong side in the 2 ̆ 2 culture war 2 ̆ 2.

I had been in {{preparation}} to work on The Tooth of Crime before I even knew <b>that</b> <b>was</b> going to be my thesis production. My second year of graduate school was spent researching the movement in the Lower East Side in the 1970 s, reading the works of Patti Smith, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphene Mallarmé, and diving into the music of Sam Shepard’s hay days in New York City.

40|$|The Battle of Beersheba, {{fought on}} October 31, 1917, was a vital {{turning point in}} the British {{campaign}} against the Ottoman Turks. The battle opened a gap in the Turkish line that eventually resulted in the British takeover of Palestine. The British command saw the cavalry charge of the 4 th Light Horse Brigade as a new tactical opportunity, and this factored into the initiative for new light tank forces designed around the concepts of mobility and flanking movements. What these commanders failed <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Palestine Campaign was an anachronistic theater of war in comparison {{to the rest of the}} Great War. The charge of the 4 th Light Horse, while courageous and vital to the success of the Battle of Beersheba, also owed its success to a confluence of advantageous circumstances, which the British command failed to take into account when designing their light tank forces prior to World War II...|$|R

50|$|Senior's 1837 Letters on the Factory Act {{have become}} notorious for the {{analytical}} mistake made in them. Nassau opposed the Child Labour Law {{and the proposed}} Ten Hours Act, {{on the grounds that}} they would make it impossible for factory owners to make profits. In Senior's analysis of factory production, capital advanced means of subsistence (wage) to the workers, who would then return the advance during the first 10½ hours of their labor, producing a profit only in the last hour. What Senior failed <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the turnover of capital stock depends on the length of the working day; he assumed it constant.|$|E

50|$|What Anton did {{not want}} the vampire <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> because Kostya <b>was</b> an Other (an Other without {{classification}} to boot), {{he would not be able}} to perform any magic in the vast emptiness of space. There would be no energy there from which he could draw on, in space he was separated from the source of all Others' energy. Kostya, assuming the shield was put up because Anton was afraid and wanted to protect himself from harm, expressed his surprise at such an act of cowardice and opened the portal. Only when the vampire stepped through it did Anton relax - the threat was over. It takes thousands of calculations to put a rocket into orbit. He knew that Kostya could not possibly calculate the exact position of the station. The portal deposited Kostya into orbit, leaving him to float in his spacesuit, unable to perform any magic. He could not make a corrective teleport into the space station - he could not open a portal back to the planet. He could only remain in orbit as that orbit decayed and he ended up burning up in the atmosphere upon re-entry, along with the book.|$|R

Breitbart even enlisted former Law & Order actor Michael Moriarty to accuse Balcer of being a Marxist agent provocateur.

5000|$|Originally, {{when he was}} storyboarding the episode, Herpich {{included}} a longer scene that explains how Finn knew what the word [...] "egress" [...] meant. In this short sequence, Finn recalls a time {{he went to a}} sideshow and noticed a sign that read [...] "This way to the Egress". Curious as to what an [...] "egress" [...] might be, he followed the sign, only to find himself having passed through the sideshow's exit. This was a reference to an actual practice of P. T. Barnum, who placed signs (which read [...] "This way to the Egress") throughout his American Museum that many believed would lead to a strange creature known as the [...] "egress". What they failed <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "egress" [...] was simply a fancy but obfuscating word for [...] "exit". Only upon passing through the egress would they realize their mistake. And since they had left the exhibit early, they would be forced to once again pay for admission if they wished to finish touring the museum. This sequence was eventually scrapped due to time constraints and replaced with a shorter scene wherein Finn merely asks Princess Bubblegum the definition of the word; Herpich also mused <b>that</b> the scene <b>was</b> cut because [...] "the T. Barnum reference might be too obscure" [...] for casual viewers.|$|R

Haap Ga Kyuhn became generally associated with Wong Hon-Wing's {{own version of the}} style.

There are numerous stories concerning the reasons for this shift and Wong Hon-Wing's subsequent loss of position. In Hong Kong, it is said there was a dispute over the royalties Wong Han-Wing was supposed to pay his teacher. In Malaysia, it is said that many of Wong Hon-Wing's students had complained to Wong Yan-Lam that their teacher was not passing on his skills. In San Francisco, more than a few teachers from several traditions hold that the old teacher had simply refused to step aside and let his student make a name for himself.

Petruchio takes on the role of a shrew to prove to his wife that this kind of behavior is unpleasant. He makes a scene as he shows up late to his own wedding, and dressed inappropriately for the occasion. He decides that he will be the one to determine when Katherine will eat or sleep, believing that depriving her of her needs makes her more submissive to him.

He transforms into a shrew himself while trying to change Katherine. By resorting to giving Katherine a taste of her own medicine, he socially degrades himself by acting shrewish.|$|E
