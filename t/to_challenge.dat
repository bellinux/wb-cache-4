40|$|Background: Theoretical {{models and}} {{emerging}} empirical {{data suggest that}} the emotional reactions of staff <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours may affect their responses <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours and their psychological well-being. However, there have been few studies focusing on factors related to staff emotional reactions. Methods: Seventy staff working in educational environments with children with intellectual disability and/or autism completed a self-report questionnaire that measured demographic factors, behavioural causal beliefs, behavioural knowledge, perceived self-efficacy, and emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours. Results: Regression analyses revealed that behavioural causal beliefs were a positive predictor, and self-efficacy and behavioural knowledge were negative predictors of negative emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours. Staff with formal qualifications also reported more negative emotional reactions. No other demographic factors emerged as significant predictors. Conclusions: The results suggest that behavioural causal beliefs, low self-efficacy and low behavioural knowledge may make staff vulnerable to experiencing negative emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours. Researchers and clinicians need to address these issues in staff who work with people with challenging behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hastings, R. P. [American Journal on Mental Retardation (2002) Vol. 107, pp. 455 – 467] {{hypothesized}} that staff negative emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour might accumulate {{over time to}} affect staff well-being. Only one previous study (Mitchell, G. & Hastings, R. P. [American Journal on Mental Retardation (2001) Vol. 106, pp. 448 – 459] has explored this relationship. The present analyses were designed to replicate these findings. Methods: Data were analysed from two samples of staff. In study 1, 101 staff rated their typical emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviours experienced {{as a part of}} their work and completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In study 2, 99 staff rated their negative emotional reactions <b>to</b> written <b>challenging</b> behaviour vignettes and also completed the MBI. Results: In both studies, significant positive correlations were found between negative emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour and emotional exhaustion and depersonalization burnout but no association was found with personal accomplishment scores. Conclusions: These findings replicate previous results, but cannot be used to support the putative causal relationship between emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour and staff well-being. Clinical implications of a focus on staff emotional reactions <b>to</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour are discussed...|$|R
