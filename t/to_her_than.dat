25|$|The United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Thomas F. Bayard, {{introduced}} Mary to London {{society in}} 1894. She met a young man, George Curzon, a Conservative Member of Parliament who was thirty-five years old, had been representing Southport for eight years, and was {{heir to the}} Barony of Scarsdale. However, the position he had made for himself through his own talents was of more interest <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> his eventual inheritance, and his high reputation as a writer on the political questions in the East particularly attracted her admiration.|$|E

25|$|A gifted concert violinist of {{international}} repute, her considerable talents and reputation were eventually eclipsed {{by those of}} her lover, in whose shade she appeared content to remain. In return, Pound was more loyal, not to say faithful, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> to any of his many other mistresses. He dedicated the final stanza of his epic The Cantos to her, in homage and gratitude for her courageous and loyal support of Pound during his 13-year incarceration in a mental hospital after having been indicted for treasonous activities against the United States and in support of Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. She also defended Pound against the accusation that he was anti-Semitic. During the last 11 years of Pound's life, Rudge was his devoted companion, secretary, and nurse, as he sank into eccentricity and prolonged silences.|$|E
25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life trying to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing things the way Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E

During the lap dance, Michael becomes {{concerned that this}} is cheating on Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin) and brings the show to an abrupt close. Dwight decides to get the [...] "three hours of work" [...] they paid the stripper for by having her answer calls. After consulting with [...] "Ben Franklin" [...] and the stripper, Michael decides to tell Jan about the lap dance. However, Jan is less upset by his unfaithfulness <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> by his violation of company policy. Relieved, Michael makes lovey dovey talk to Jan even as she suggests firing him over the incident.|$|E

[...] "She {{knew it was time}} to make a change" [...] as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> the constant media circus surrounding her. In November 1995, Madonna released a compilation album, Something to Remember, featuring a selection of her ballads over a decade of her career and three new songs; described as a [...] "love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike" [...] the compilation was targeted to emphasize the singer's musical abilities, and away from the theatrics. On the album's liner notes, Madonna further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Taraborrelli was proven wrong, and, in 1990, he {{considered}} writing her biography, but put the thought aside, thinking such a venture was premature. He {{pointed out that}} [...] "most subjects need time for evolution and personal growths, before their stories are ripe enough to put on paper. Madonna was in an ambitious, self-involved phase during which nothing mattered more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> her career." [...] He picked up the writing again in 1994, but {{felt the same way}} about her, and hoped the time would come when the singer would focus on her personal life, rather than her career. A personal evolution occurred in her life with the birth of daughter Lourdes in 1996, and it was then that Taraborrelli sensed the time was ripe to begin writing her biography.|$|E

500|$|In June 1986, Stephen Cook from TV Week {{announced}} that Daphne would accept a proposal from either Des or Shane, which would definitely result in her getting married. Smith told Cook [...] "I don't know whether Daphne actually needs {{a man in}} her life but she's certainly got two men there. It's a triangle that's developed, but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E

[...] "She {{knew it was time}} to make a change" [...] as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> the constant media circus surrounding her. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of , documented that Madonna had previously stated that many of her songs have been overlooked in response to current trends, with her long-time friend and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï stating [...] "she hasn't shouted about her musical abilities." [...] Taraborrelli explained [...] "So, whether Madonna released Something to Remember, a collection of previously released love songs, because she had a point to prove or simply to keep a contractual obligation, the fourteen track recording did make a statement." [...] Described as a [...] "love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike" [...] the compilation seemed to notify her contemporaries of her musical talent.

500|$|Although {{initially}} {{curious about}} Disraeli {{when he entered}} Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. [...] He told Matthew Arnold, [...] "Everybody likes flattery; and, {{when you come to}} royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, Adam Kirsch, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> any of her Prime Ministers except her first, Lord Melbourne. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to kiss hands, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, [...] "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage." ...|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{her first}} studio album, Don't Forget, Lovato did not {{collaborate}} with the Jonas Brothers on Here We Go Again as {{she wanted to}} see what her sound would be like without their input. [...] "They were the only people I'd ever written with. Once I wrote with different people, I wanted to go with that", she told the New York Daily News. She said that her first album was [...] "very Jonas" [...] and that Here We Go Again is [...] "a little bit more like what's coming from my heart. It's more me." [...] However, Lovato did work with Nick Jonas on the song [...] "Stop the World". The majority of the album was produced by John Fields, who also handled production on Don't Forget. Other tracks were produced by SuperSpy, Gary Clark, Andy Dodd and Adam Watts. [...] "Catch Me" [...] is the only song on the album for which Lovato received sole writing credit. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she wrote it in her room and that it means more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the album.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as {{she said when she}} received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she found out it was a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> the Legion of Honour.|$|E
500|$|Rachel then {{confronts the}} non-participating glee members and insults them, {{but when she}} starts to sing Miley Cyrus's [...] "The Climb", she sounds terrible: she has started to lose her voice. Later, after an {{examination}} by Rachel's doctor reveals that she suffers from tonsillitis and may need to have her tonsils removed, she is afraid to have the surgery lest it affect her voice, as she believes her singing ability is her only asset. Finn, who accompanied her to the doctor's, tries to convince her that he loves everything about her {{and that there is}} more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> her voice. He warns her that if she loses her ability to sing then Jesse (Jonathan Groff) would no longer find her attractive. Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing [...] "Jessie's Girl" [...] as his solo assignment. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game. At first, Rachel is nervous and overwhelmed by the meeting, but Finn forces her to stay as Sean tells her about his grueling experiences with his disability and how he realized that a person is not just one single thing. She then begins to understand why Finn brought her and thanks Sean as she leaves.|$|E

500|$|Steph {{appeared}} to [...] "finally [...] happiness" [...] when {{she fell in}} love with Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Although attracted to her, Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a [...] "ditzy, air-headed blonde", only interested in [...] "bad boys." [...] When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the [...] "kind, sensitive way" [...] Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, [...] "Max begins to realise there's more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends." [...] Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed off on their wedding day, as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and [...] "such an awful thing to happen to Steph", until she received [...] "amazing feedback" [...] about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent [...] "what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss." [...] Kirkwood praised Stenson's performance throughout the storyline, particularly during in that scene.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{included}} Claire {{among the}} characters {{they would like}} to see returning for Resident Evil 6, with Schedeen calling Claire [...] "leagues above that walking bag of useless called Sheva." [...] PlayStation Universe also chose Claire in her original outfit from Resident Evil 2 as one of the five characters they wanted to appear in Resident Evil 6s Mercenaries mode as she [...] "is long overdue a canonical appearance in the series." [...] In 2012, RE6 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi wrote they have [...] "heard a lot of love for Jill and Claire recently and people asking if they’ll be in the next Resident Evil." [...] Including Claire among the 30 best characters in the three decades of Capcom's history, GamesRadar staff commented in 2013: [...] "Sadly she's fallen into the background of the series, which makes sense she avoided work as a government zombie hunter, but we hope Capcom has plans for her in the future. Here's a suggestion: a co-op focused RE that teams Claire up with the almost as underused Jill. It's your move Capcom." [...] Reacting to Claire's return in Revelations 2 IGN's Mitch Dyer wrote: [...] "The Resident Evil series places women in prominent, powerful, playable roles. Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers, Sheva Alomar, and Ada Wong, to name a few. Still, they're often opposite a male lead. This is the first time a Resident Evil game has revolved around the story of two women. It's fun to get to play as Claire again." [...] According to a CVG preview of Revelations 2, [...] "she's older, calmer and more capable, but she still retains everything that made her compelling in the first place. Where Rachael from the first [...] was part centrefold, part melted-ice cream, Claire feels distinct from many women in the Resi universe in that there's more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>than</b> lady-lumps and lycra. She's the perfect choice for the game's brand of isolated horror." ...|$|E
