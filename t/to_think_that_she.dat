After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle.

Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished she had told her friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E

The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still alive. It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E

Like her father, inheriting the Akimichi's clan fighting style, she never turns down an invitation when it comes to food and is quite confident and self-assured about herself, a trait she perhaps inherited from her mother. But during the events of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Chocho becomes conscious of her weight while starting <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might be an adopted child. Chocho accompanies her friend Sarada in search of her father, Sasuke, believing the trip to be in search of her [...] "real" [...] father instead.

In the Japanese version of [...] "The Day Naruto became Hokage" [...] OVA and onward, she is voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi.|$|E
50|$|All clues {{given by}} Buzzstation seem {{to point to}} Malaya. However, Lewandowski denied the reports, saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> knew the actor since Gabby Concepcion is a family friend. She also refused {{to talk about the}} controversies since she doesn't want the people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> just using Concepcion to become popular.|$|R

When Reed threatens to use it against Galactus, the planet-eater agrees to spare the Earth and leave if Reed gives him back the weapon. True to his word, Galactus leaves but not before making it so the Surfer can never leave the Earth, by {{removing}} his [...] "space-time powers". After the battle, Alicia thanks the Silver Surfer for his help, causing the jealous Thing <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> choosing the Surfer over him.

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or}} another by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Remedios the Beauty is Arcadio and Santa Sofía's first child. It is {{said she}} is the most {{beautiful}} woman ever seen in Macondo, and unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is mentally retarded. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: [...] "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war", he said. [...] She rejects clothing and beauty. [...] Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon in the 4pm sun, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.|$|E

60|$|Benita shuddered; {{the solemn}} awfulness {{of the place}} and scene oppressed her. She began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> too, saw those ghosts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well. She was restive {{the first}} day, {{and wanted to}} get <b>to</b> Bedsworth. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has given it up now as a bad job. Stevens, the gatekeeper, is a very worthy fellow." ...|$|R

50|$|However, as the {{stresses}} of Rosemary's wedding begin to pile up (tension between the lower-middle-class MacLanes and Greg's wealthy parents; {{the cost of the}} wedding and the short time frame granted to plan it in; and the sacrifices Rosemary and Greg must make, such as becoming landlords of a dumpy tenement to save on rent), Barbara begins <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> maybe <b>she's</b> not ready to live the life of a serious adult just yet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To think,' said Mrs Chick, in a {{state of}} soliloquy, 'that she should ever have {{conceived}} the base idea of connecting herself with our family by a marriage with Paul! <b>To</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when <b>she</b> was playing at horses with that dear child who is now in his grave--I never liked it at the time--she should have been hiding such a double-faced design!

50|$|Elsewhere in {{the city}} Gasback confronts Cain once again and {{explains}} to his betrayer that he's {{not going to kill}} him, but instead steal everything that belongs to him. Cain had believed the target of the theft was his statue, but in fact the object is far more valuable. Gasback sets off a string of explosions which separate the city's Plant from its cradle and the massive light-bulb like Plant rolls through the town past dumbstruck citizens straight to the city's main gates where a special getaway vehicle secures the Plant and drives away. Amelia immediately takes a vehicle and chases after Gasback and she is followed by Vash and Wolfwood. She catches up to Gasback and starts shooting coming dangerously close to hitting the Plant. Vash and Wolfwood pull up between them and Vash tries to calm Amelia down, but he is shot by one of Gasback's henchmen and falls into dry quicksand. Wolfwood leaps in after him to save him, but only manages to pull up Vash's sunglasses. They take the sad news back to Milly and Meryl in the now darkened city and Amelia starts <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> no better than Gasback.|$|R

5000|$|Malduk - old {{shepherd}} who, {{because of}} his injured back, makes his wife and Alina {{do a lot of}} the work around his home. Malduk took Alina in after finding her in the snow, and constantly hangs the idea that Alina owes him for it over her head. He is a superstitious, often cruel man who hardly gives Alina anything to eat aside from bread and a [...] "potion" [...] that he claims will keep the goblins away from Alina, who {{is said to be a}} Changeling. A tsinga, or witch/gypsy, gave Malduk the mixture that in reality gave Alina amnesia. This was to ensure that the topic of where Alina came from would not come up, since the girl was already under suspicion because of her strange origins and red hair. Alina's red hair is mentioned in the book, and the villagers of Moldov seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> a Saxon. Malduk makes Alina do more work than even a boy is expected to do, and both he and his wife Ranna treat her cruelly. Malduk, while pursuing Alina with a band of villagers, is killed by Fell when the wolf moves to protect Alina.|$|R

All this Sue understood full well, and it added quite considerably to her joy <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> soon <b>she</b> could relieve the patriot and hero from penury, and that the news <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could do so would be a glad surprise for him.|$|R
