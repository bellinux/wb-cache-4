25|$|The {{narrative}} goes on {{to state}} that when Judah (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob's heart. This caused Joseph <b>to</b> recant and <b>reveal</b> <b>his</b> identity. The midrashic book of Jasher argues that prior <b>to</b> <b>revealing</b> <b>his</b> identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via astrology, using an astrolabe-like tool. It continues by stating that Benjamin divined that {{the man on the}} throne was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and <b>revealed</b> <b>his</b> scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.|$|R
5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>his</b> or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, so as not <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>his</b> position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his campaign. The rebels reached Constantinople in October 610.

Priscus, {{the commander of the}} Excubitors, chose the moment <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>his</b> allegiance to Heraclius, having apparently secretly conspired for some time.

5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing <b>to</b> <b>reveal</b> <b>his</b> secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E

5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post.
