25|$|New Zealand cricketer Warren Lees {{recounted the}} underarm {{incident}} on New Zealand's 20/20 current affairs show, on Thursday 17 February 2005.

25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
