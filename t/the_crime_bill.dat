5000|$|From 1942 to 1946, Smith {{served in}} the United States Naval Reserve, {{reaching}} the rank of lieutenant. In 1946 he joined {{the law firm of}} Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in Los Angeles, {{one of the largest in}} the area.

He met Ronald Reagan before the 1966 campaign for governor, eventually becoming a member of the influential circle of advisers who formed the new governor's [...] "kitchen cabinet". In 1968, Reagan appointed him to the University of California Board of Regents. He later served three terms as chairman. On December 11, 1980, Smith was nominated as the 74th Attorney General by the newly elected President Reagan. He assumed his post at the United States Department of Justice, on January 23, 1981, serving until February 25, 1985. He pursued a strong anticrime initiative, increasing the resources used to fight the distribution and sale of illegal narcotics by 100 percent. Furthermore, he successfully lobbied for the establishment of a commission to create new federal sentencing guidelines. Major contributions were: supported Reagan's welfare reform program, recommended a comprehensive crime package, of more than 150 administrative and legislative initiatives, which included a federal death penalty, the denial of bail for certain types of crimes, the modification of the rule barring the use of illegally seized evidence in criminal trials, mandatory prison sentences for crimes involving the use of guns, and the use of private Internal Revenue Service information in combating organized crime; designed an immigration and refugee policy, announced a more lenient attitude towards corporate mergers in order to make government more responsive to the concerns of business, opposed anti competitive practices, modified the Freedom of Information Act of 1966, amongst many others. Notable are immigration bill and <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>bill</b> of 1984. He also was the one who got the FBI into drug enforcement.

40|$|I {{think the}} great {{majority}} of judges, lawyers, and law professors would have concurred in Judge Friendly 2 ̆ 7 s remarks when he made them thirty-three years ago. To put it another way, I believe few would have had much confidence in the constitutionality of an anti-Miranda provision, usually known as § 3501 because of its designation under Title 18 of the United States Code, a provision of Title II of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (hereinafter referred to as the Crime Act or <b>the</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Bill),</b> when that legislation was signed by the president on June 19, 1968. 2 Section 3501 makes the pre-Escobedo, 3 pre-Miranda 4 2 ̆ 2 due process 2 ̆ 2 - 2 ̆ 2 totality of circumstances 2 ̆ 2 - 2 ̆ 2 voluntariness 2 ̆ 2 rule the sole test for the admissibility of confessions in federal prosecutions, thereby purporting to overrule by legislation the Warren Court 2 ̆ 7 s two most famous confession cases. (Although rarely, if ever, noted, § 3501 also literally overrules at least two other Supreme Court cases. 5) However, even if it were true that the Supreme Court would not have permitted Congress to do anything about (or would only have allowed it to do very little about) Miranda some thirty years ago, whether the Court will take the same position today is a very different question. For in the 1970 s and 80 s the Court had some unkind things to say about Miranda. 6 The Burger and Rehnquist Courts 2 ̆ 7 characterization of and comments about Miranda give {{reason to believe that the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s thinking about that famous case has changed dramatically since the days of the Warren Court. To give but one example of how the case for upholding the constitutionality of § 3501 has changed: So far as I can tell, no witness who testified at the committee hearings on <b>the</b> <b>Crime</b> <b>Bill</b> and no participant in the House and Senate debates over the bill ever referred to the Miranda warnings or Miranda procedural safeguards as 2 ̆ 2 prophylactic. 2 ̆ 2 This fact is hardly surprising for the Miranda opinion itself never did so either. 7 But when a panel of the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Dickersons sustained the constitutionality of § 3501, thereby holding that the pre-Miranda 2 ̆ 2 voluntariness 2 ̆ 2 test set forth in this section, rather than the Miranda case, now governs the admissibility of confessions in the federal courts, it relied heavily on the fact that the Burger and Rehnquist Courts had 2 ̆ 2 consistently (and repeatedly) [...] . referred to the [Miranda] warnings as 2 ̆ 7 prophylactic 2 ̆ 7... and 2 ̆ 7 not themselves rights protected by the Constitution. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 79 In this Article, I shall consider the arguments made in defense of the constitutionality of § 3501 at the time it was debated and enacted some thirty years ago and the arguments made on behalf of § 3501 today. But first I think it useful to discuss the history of, and debates over, § 3501 -and the mood of the U. S. Senate (and the country) at the time. ...|$|E
40|$|The 2016 U. S. presidential {{election}} {{can be described}} as nostalgic. On one hand, there was the fond remembrance of the Clinton administration characterized by a period of economic prosperity which overshadowed the more disastrous aftermath of various policies (<b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>bill,</b> the welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act, the repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, etc.). On the other, the 2016 election brought to the surface a dormant longing for a privileged past rooted in open discrimination, inequality, segregation, and white supremacy, echoed by Donald Trump’s campaign. The Republican candidate had won the party’s nomination by openly and devoutly proselytizing against minority groups that allegedly threaten the fabric, integrity, and security of the United States. The more ethnic stereotypical caricatures and outright lies he employed in his speeches, the more successful his primary campaign was and the more he unnerved the Republican establishment, the general electorate, and the media. Yet Donald Trump’s campaign was not innovative by any means. Instead, as this study will argue, Trump’s electoral success during the primary elections can be in part attributed to the Republican Party’s decades-long history of strategic racism that has been instrumental in grooming the party’s base into Donald Trump’s supporters. In order to showcase that Trump’s ascendancy {{to the top of the}} Republican primary election was not a political accident, but a natural progression of decades-old officially sanctioned electoral policies, the study analyzes the origins behind the “dog whistle” practice, based on the model of strategic racism advanced by Ian Haney López. In conducting this research, I provide examples from U. S. public officials – past and present – and also highlight the role of the media in the propagation and cultivation of dog whistle politics...|$|E
