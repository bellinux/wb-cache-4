5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks {{to the inside of}} the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer on the inside of the pellet. Each target costs <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars.</b>|$|E
