5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E

5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one.

5|$|In September 2014, Gröning {{was charged}} by German {{prosecutors}} as {{an accessory to}} murder, in 300,000 cases, for his role at the Auschwitz concentration camp. His trial began in April 2015, after <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> ruled that, {{at the age of}} 93, he was still fit to stand trial. The trial was held in Lüneburg, Germany. On 15 July 2015, he was found guilty of facilitating mass murder and sentenced to four years' imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from its}} general {{equitable}} jurisdiction, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction {{over a number}} of other matters. First, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> sole power to appoint guardians of the property and person for mentally or physically disabled Delaware residents. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> may also appoint guardians for minors, although <b>the</b> Family <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> coterminous jurisdiction over such matters.

50|$|Historically, whilst <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{been fairly}} {{amenable}} {{to the use}} of trusts in tax planning, as tax planning schemes have become more aggressive, so <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> increasingly taken a restrictive view of their tax treatment.|$|R
5|$|On 8 September 1588 at Blois, where <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> {{assembled}} for {{a meeting}} of the Estates, Henry dismissed all his ministers without warning.

5|$|The statute {{essentially}} codifies the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine, {{established by}} the United States Supreme Court in two cases decided in 1916 and 1918. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> established in those cases that a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark may establish priority over a senior user's claim to the mark in the junior user's area.|$|E
5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E
5000|$|There are common-law and {{statutory}} {{grounds for}} disqualification that prevent beneficiaries from inheriting, and <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>have,</b> over time, developed the law relating to these.

5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with {{statehood}} in 1859, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> {{just four}} justices, {{one for each}} judicial district in the state. The constitution created by the Oregon Constitutional Convention in 1857 called for these justices to serve as both circuit court judges and supreme court justices. This was set to remain until {{the population of the}} state reached 100,000 people. Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather at set intervals to confer on appeals, which would occur at least once per year and were authorized to meet more frequently if needed. On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases such as}} Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, , R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) and others, <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{addressed}} {{various areas}} of controversial speech. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> frequently sided with the speakers, but occasionally <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> sided with <b>the</b> government and acknowledged its (limited) power to pass laws protecting citizens from specific types of harmful speech.|$|R

5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily clouded his career. In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes. He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> {{no choice but to}} dismiss him from the service. In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E

60|$|This, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps {{you will}} say <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> decided <b>the</b> disputed Constitutional {{question}} in your favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> decided <b>the</b> {{question for you}} {{in a sort of}} way. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>has</b> substantially said, it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property.|$|R
25|$|Once the United States {{asserted}} {{that it was}} a party to the case, Gray concluded, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>had</b> no jurisdiction and should not have heard the case. Once the United States interposed itself between Kaufman and Strong and <b>the</b> plaintiff, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> should not <b>have</b> ordered trial to proceed against them, either.

5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he deserved {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, saying that he had been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>had</b> accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E
5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
