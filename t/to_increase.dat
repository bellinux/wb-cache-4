5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

In Study 2, we explored this finding further, and found that any combination of the gratefulness activity and eating ice cream (together or alone) led <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> positive affect. The same pattern of results was observed for affect balance and the ratio of positive to negative emotions. The gratefulness activity only also led <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> gratitude as measured by the GQ- 6. Results showed that even simple, naturalistic everyday activities can lead <b>to</b> <b>increases</b> in positive affect. This experience of positive affect may be one mediating pathway through which positive psychology interventions, and indeed everyday activities, are effective in enhancing happiness and well-being.|$|R
