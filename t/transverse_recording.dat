50|$|Helical {{scanning}} was {{a logical}} progression beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, {{also referred to}} as <b>transverse</b> <b>recording.</b> In this scheme, the rotating head drum runs essentially perpendicular to a 2 in tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. quadruplex systems revolve the head drum at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four heads on the drum so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use.|$|E

Phase-velocity maps expanded on a 0. 25 °-by- 0. 25 ° pixel grid are estimated by inversion of the phase-velocity measurements. Comparison with predicted phase-velocity maps based on the crustal model CRUST 2. 0 combined with the mantle model ND 08 shows good agreement at the longer periods.

It is shown that short duration (similar topicosecond) pumping can produce X-ray laser pulses of a few picosecond duration and that measurement of the emission from the plasma can give an estimate of the duration of the gain coefficient. The Ehybrid fluid and atomic physics code developed at the University of York is used to simulate X-ray laser gain and plasma emission. Two postprocessors to the Ehybrid code are utilized: 1) to raytrace the X-ray laser beam amplification and refraction and 2) to calculate the radiation emission in the kiloelectronvolt photon energy range. The raytracing and spectral simulations are compared, respectively, to measured X-ray laser output and the output of two diagnostics <b>recording</b> <b>transverse</b> X-ray emission. The pumping laser energy absorbed in the plasma is examined by comparing the simulations to experimental results.

The final version is available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this <b>record.</b> <b>Transverse</b> (t) -tubules are invaginations of the plasma membrane that form a complex network of ducts, 200 - 400  nm in diameter depending on the animal species, that penetrates deep within the cardiac myocyte, where they facilitate a fast and synchronous contraction across the entire cell volume. There is now {{a large body of}} evidence in animal models and humans demonstrating that pathological distortion of the t-tubule structure has a causative role in the loss of myocyte contractility that underpins many forms of heart failure. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms of pathological t-tubule remodelling to date have focused on proteins residing in the intracellular aspect of t-tubule membrane that form linkages between the membrane and myocyte cytoskeleton. In this review, we shed light on the mechanisms of t-tubule remodelling which are not limited to the intracellular side. Our recent data have demonstrated that collagen {{is an integral part of}} the t-tubule network and that it increases within the tubules in heart failure, suggesting that a fibrotic mechanism could drive cardiac junctional remodelling. We examine the evidence that the linkages between the extracellular matrix, t-tubule membrane and cellular cytoskeleton should be considered as a whole when investigating the mechanisms of t-tubule pathology in the failing heart.

The hemodynamic {{effect of a}} patch is unclear and this study attempted to elucidate this and guide patch width selection. MethodsFour groups were selected: healthy volunteers and patients undergoing CEA with primary closure, trimmed patch (5  mm), or 8 -mm patch angioplasty. Computer-generated three-dimensional models of carotid bifurcations were produced from <b>transverse</b> ultrasound images <b>recorded</b> at 1 -mm intervals. Rapid prototyping generated models for flow visualization studies. Computational fluid dynamic studies were performed for each model and validated by flow visualization. Mean wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) maps were created for each model using pulsatile inflow at 300  mL/min. WSS of  0. 3 were considered pathological, predisposing to accretion of intimal hyperplasia. The resultant WSS and OSI maps were compared. ResultsThe four groups comprised 8 normal carotid arteries, 6 primary closures, 6 trimmed patches, and seven 8 -mm patches. Flow visualization identified flow separation and recirculation at the bifurcation increased with a patch and {{was related to the}} patch width. Computational fluid dynamic identified that primary closure had the fewest areas of low WSS or elevated OSI but did have mild common carotid artery stenoses at the proximal arteriotomy that caused turbulence. Trimmed patches had more regions of abnormal WSS and OSI at the bifurcation, but 8 -mm patches had the largest areas of deleteriously low WSS and high OSI. Qualitative comparison among the four groups confirmed that incorporation of a patch increased areas of low WSS and high OSI at the bifurcation and that this was related to patch width. ConclusionsClosure technique after CEA influences the hemodynamic profile. Patching does not appear to generate favorable flow dynamics. However, a trimmed 5 -mm patch may offer hemodynamic benefits over an 8 -mm patch and may be the preferred option...|$|R
40|$|There are {{indications}} of two low-velocity layers in the earth's crust and mantle, one, in the continents, at depths between roughly 10 and 20 km, {{the other at}} depths from roughly 60 km to about 150 km for P and about 250 km for S. The first is called here the lithosphere channel, the second the asthenosphere channel. If an earthquake originates in a low-velocity layer, waves leaving the source downward cannot enter the layers with relatively high velocity above the channel and reach the surface unless they reach a layer below the source with a wave velocity at least equal to the maximum velocity above the source. If an earthquake occurs in the lithosphere channel, waves starting downward must consequently reach at least the depth where the velocity equals the maximum reached above the channel (which is about 6 ¾ km/sec in Southern California) in order {{to arrive at the}} surface and to be recorded. The travel-time curve of such waves with a deepest point above the Mohorovičić discontinuity may easily be misinterpreted as caused by waves refracted at a (nonexisting) discontinuity below the source where the velocity is believed to increase suddenly to about 7 km/sec. A large fraction of the energy in earthquakes originating in a low-velocity layer remains in the channel. In earthquakes with a source above the lithosphere channel, much more energy is transmitted to the epicentral area than in those originating in this channel, and relatively great damage may result. New evidence for the asthenosphere channel is discussed. It is based mainly on travel times and amplitudes of longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> waves on <b>records</b> of the largest Kern County, California, earthquakes in July, 1952, for which epicenters are established within about 4 km, and origin times within {{about a quarter of a}} second...|$|R
40|$|Wood is a {{hygroscopic}} material, which exchanges moisture continuously {{with the}} surrounding environment. This process involves heat of sorption phenomenon which is either a releases or adsorption of heat, resulting in temperature change on wood surface, which can potentially be utilized to reduce indoor energy consumption. The main objective {{of this research was}} to determine a suitable method and develop a protocol to accurately measure the temperature change on wood surface during exchanging moisture with the ambient environment. While conventional invasive measurement techniques were not considered to be suitable for this purpose, thermography demonstrated the advantages to measure surface temperature and was thus employed as the main technique to measure the change in wood surface temperature during moisture sorption. The measured protocol was validated experimentally by recording temperature change on pine wood surface which is subjected to a change in relative humidity of the environment instantaneously from relatively 0 to 95 %. From experimental results, the anisotropy property in wood clearly showed the influence on the temperature change on pine wood during adsorption. The maximum temperature rise on a <b>transverse</b> surface was <b>recorded</b> as approximately 3. 6 ± 0. 4 oC, whereas it was only approximately 1. 4 ± 0. 4 oC in cases of radial and tangential surfaces. The experimental uncertainty obtained from 10 repetitions for each direction surface was considerably lower compared with the estimated uncertainty from literature review as 1. 17 oC. Therefore, it confirmed the suitable ability of thermography to record temperature change on wood due to the heat of sorption phenomenon. The measurement protocol established from this study can be applied to investigate the temperature variation occurring from different initial moisture contents during sorption in different wood species. Furthermore, the surface temperature data obtained from the heat of sorption experiments will be significant inputs for numerical models describing the behaviour of a wooden building with higher accuracy...|$|R
40|$|THIS Second Interim Report {{deals with}} the results {{obtained}} during the 1950 and 1951 seasons of excavation and is concerned in particular with {{the northern part of}} the building where an important complex of ramps and stairways has been revealed. The Basement Room has also been excavated a further 5 ft. towards the east in the hope of reaching its limit in this direction. The limit has not been reached, however, and the presence of the road and underlying sewer defers further excavation. It is essential to obtain complete access to all the evidence contained in the filling of the Basement Room, as without it not only are we pre-vented from working out its successive purposes, but, even more important, we cannot complete the unique Early Christian paintings that adorned the upper room and which are contained in the filling below. Both northern and southern walls of the fourth century house have now been obtained, and most of the western edge has been defined. As the work on the south and south-west has not yet been completed, the results of this have not been incorporated in this Report. Work has also been carried out on the short corridors north and south of the Mosaic Rooms to obtain more precise dating, and this work is being carried forward into the 1952 season. The evidence here is sparse, but what has come to light suggests an early to mid-fourth-century date for the mosaics themselves. Room 15 is dealt with in detail, and a <b>transverse</b> section is <b>recorded,</b> together with an architectural section west to east along the line of the main flight of steps and extending through rooms 14, 15, and 16. The stratification in Room 15 provides a large quantity of evidence in relation to the neighbouring rooms and especially in relation to the Basement Room, whose chronology is rendered clearer, although its successive purposes, while suggestive, yet remain obscure; its con-ceivable parallels may perhaps be found in the neighbourhood of the Rhineland. A second architectural section has been recorded from south to north throughout the house and passes through Rooms 11 and 15. This section, when compared to the west to east section, the plan...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Moment {{excitation}} is often neglected within structural dynamic analysis {{since it is}} assumed that energy input to structures due to moment excitation is more important in the high frequency region. Also, difficulties in measuring the moment and resulting angular displacement has been a reason to exclude moment excitation from the analysis of vibrating structures. However, {{it has been shown that}} moment induced vibrational energy at low frequencies is important in the analysis when sources are close in proximity of discontinuities [1, 2] and particularly if the translatory motion at a discontinuity is constrained [3, 4]. Vibrational energy transmissions to machinery supporting structures subjected to multi-excitation systems were studied in [5, 6]. However, difficulties occurred with the measurement of rotational response at lower frequencies and measurement of moment excitation. An investigation of moment excited beam structures using a T-and I-shape exciter configuration was of interest in [7, 8]. The effects of loading due to moment exciter mass and transducer mass have been studied. It was found that two main bias errors when measuring moment mobility occurred. The authors suggested that the I-shape exciter configuration is the better choice when exciting structures by a applied moment. Moment excitation was applied to a simply supported aluminium plate in reference [9]. Two impact hammers to generate a force couple separated by a certain distance, acting parallel to each other and in opposite direction have been employed. Using this method, different force separation distances had to be taken into account when measuring a wide range of frequencies. The aim of this paper is to report a novel finite difference based measurement technique to measure the moment point mobility and the vibrational input energy to an experimental “infinite” rectangular beam. A first order finite difference approximation is used to approximate the angular displacement of the beam at the excitation location from <b>recorded</b> <b>transverse</b> acceleration signals. These signals were acquired by a pair of closely spaced accelerometers around the excitation location. The moment was induced by two opposite forces impacting the moment arms that were attached perpendicular to the beam...|$|R
40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. Positive surges are commonly observed in man-made channels while some estuaries may be subjected to a positive surge process called tidal bore during flood tides. The {{aim of this study}} is to detail the hydrodynamic and turbulence characteristics of tidal bores that were rarely studied under controlled flow conditions. New experiments were conducted with positive surges in a large channel (L = 12 m, W = 0. 5 m). Detailed turbulence measurements were performed with high-temporal resolution (50 Hz) using side-looking acoustic Doppler velocimetry and non-intrusive free-surface measurement devices. The experiments were designed to study a range of positive surges with a minimum number of dependant variables. Most tests were conducted with a horizontal bed slope, a constant flow rate (Q = 0. 040 m 3 /s) and uncontrolled flow conditions. The only dependant variable was the downstream gate opening after closure. Two main types of positive surge were observed. For surge Froude numbers Fr less than 1. 7, the bore was an undular surge. For Fr 1. 7), a weak (breaking) surge was observed and the surge front had a marked roller. Detailed turbulent measurements were conducted in the initial flow at one location. Instantaneous velocity measurements beneath surges showed a marked effect of the surge passage. Streamwise velocities were characterised by a rapid flow deceleration at all vertical elevations, and some flow reversal were measured next to the bed in the weak surge flow. Large fluctuations of <b>transverse</b> velocities were <b>recorded</b> beneath the surges. Turbulent stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data. The results showed large normal and tangential Reynolds stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular and weak surge data suggested two main mechanisms of bed scour and scalar transport. In weak surge flows, the data showed some rapid flow separation beneath the surge front. In undular surges, maximum Reynolds stresses were observed beneath and just before each wave crest. Experimental results were compared with data sets obtained in stationary hydraulic jumps and in tidal bores. The latter field measurements and observations emphasised very-strong turbulence levels behind bore fronts that might be underestimated in small-size laboratory channels and in bore experiments propagating in stationary fluid. Overall the present study demonstrated the uniqueness of positive surges and some key differences with hydraulic jumps flows...|$|R
40|$|The fibular flap {{was first}} {{described}} in 1975 by Taylor et al. for reconstruction of large bony defects. In 1983, Chen and Yan first described the osteocutaneous fibular flap and later Hidalgo et al. {{were the first}} who used the osteocutaneous free fibular flap in mandibular reconstruction. Furthermore the osteocutaneous free fibular flap has been successfully used in {{the reconstruction of the}} metatarsal after the resection of malignant tumors, in the reconstruction of the velopharyngeal competence after the resection of tumors, in the treatment of the atrophy of the maxilla, in the reconstruction of the spine after the resection of tumors or for the treatment of the severe cyphosis due to arthritis, neurofibromatosis or tuberculosis. The incorporation of the skin island in the free fibular flap has also allowed the use of the flap in the simultaneous one-stage reconstruction of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the cervical spine. Another application of the free fibular flap is in the reconstruction of the pelvic ring after large bony defects. The sensate osteocutanous free fibular flap has been also used in the penile reconstruction. Although the iliac crest, the scapulae, the ribs, the metatarsals and the radius have been used for reconstruction of mandibular defects, the bone that best matches the biomechanical properties of the mandible is the fibula. The fibula provides also up to 25 cm of solid bone enough to reconstruct any length of mandibular defect and capable of supporting dental implants. Furthermore, it allows the simultaneous approach of two operating teams reducing the operating time and the postoperative morbidity is considered to be low. Today the osteocutaneous free fibular flap represents the most popular procedure in the reconstruction of composite mandibular defects. In the beginning the free fibular flap was used in the reconstruction of extensive long-bone defects after tumor ablation or posttraumatic This study was performed on 15 formalin preserved adult cadavers with an age ranging between 52 and 94 years. The lower extremities of each cadaver were dissected bilaterally. The dissection was focused on the perforator arteries that penetrate the crural fascia, ending in the skin centered over the posterolateral intermuscular septum of the leg and over the skin of the lateral edge of the soleus muscle (SM). A large incision was made in the skin along the peroneous longus muscle (PLM), parallel to the fibula from the fibular head to the lateral malleolus, 2 cm in front of the posterior edge of the fibula. A skin flap was elevated in the deep fascial plane at a width of 5 cm around the posterior border of the fibula. The crural fascia was incised according to the skin incision and the perforators were dissected towards their source artery. We studied only the perforators of the PA that had an external diameter greater than 0. 3 mm at the fascia penetration site. We recorded the number of the perforators, their location relative to the fibula, their course and their diameter at the fascia penetration site. The distance between the posterior margin of the fibula and the point of emergence of the artery from the fascia was measured. Additionally, the diameter of the anterior tibial artery (ATA), the posterior tibial artery (PTA), the PA correspondingly to their branching site, as well as the diameter of the popliteal artery (POPA) correspondingly {{to the head of the}} fibula were determined. Finally, the distance between the head of the fibula and the branching site of the ATA and the distance between the head of the fibula and the bifurcation site of the tibioperoneal trunk (TPT) were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Transverse</b> sections from each vessel were routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Slides were digitized under 20 x magnification by the use of a Nikon Eclipse 80 i light microscope (Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (Nikon DS- 2 MW).
