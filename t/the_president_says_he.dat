5000|$|Sixteen {{years since}} his escape from New York, Snake {{is once again}} enlisted for a similar situation, as the story begins with a similar plotline as was used in Escape from New York. This time, Snake is forced to {{retrieve}} a disk for a remote control which controlled a series of EMP style satellites. These devices are positioned around the entire world. The disk was somewhere in Los Angeles. The city had separated from the mainland due to an earthquake in August 2000 and had become an island separate from the United States which had become a totalitarian theocratic police state. Snake had to retrieve a black box which the President's (Cliff Robertson) daughter, Utopia (A.J. Langer), went into LA with. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> doesn't care if she is returned or killed, she is a traitor to his country. Snake initially refuses but once injected with the plutoxin 7 virus - which will lead to his death in ten hours - he agrees. Snake retrieves the box and seemingly returns it to the President; however, when the President attempts to activate it, he learns {{it is not the}} real box. Snake reveals that he switched the box with a fake, and promptly uses the code [...] "666" [...] to [...] "wipe out all technology" [...] in the world.|$|E

Santorum stated, [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>says</b> <b>he's</b> a Christian, he's a Christian" [...] but has stated that Obama's agenda is based on a [...] "phony theology", not the Bible. In an interview with Glenn Beck, Santorum said Obama's desire for greater higher education rates nationwide was a veiled attempt at [...] "indoctrination", saying that [...] "62 percent of kids who go into college with a faith commitment leave without it." [...] Santorum declined to provide a source for that figure. He believes colleges reinforce secular relativism and antagonize religiosity, particularly of Christianity, and lists young people's support for abortion, gay marriage, and pornography as [...] "symptoms" [...] of indoctrination.|$|R

50|$|On January 7, 1868, the Senate {{passed a}} {{resolution}} (35-to-6) of non-concurrence with Stanton's dismissal. Grant wrote his resignation letter that same day and vacated the office, {{but he did not}} notify Johnson of this. Consequently, Stanton re-occupied the office of the Secretary of War. At a cabinet meeting the following day, Grant made stammering, unintelligible excuses for failing to pre-notify Johnson. Believing the Tenure of Office Act unconstitutional, Johnson ignored the Senate's reinstatement of Stanton until, on January 28, he offered the post to Lorenzo Thomas, a brevet major general in the Army, who first turned it down, <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> would like to stay in office as Adjutant General until his retirement. (<b>The</b> <b>President</b> originally wanted <b>the</b> position for General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was an enemy of Stanton's, but Sherman turned <b>the</b> <b>President</b> down, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> hated politics.) Johnson later convinced Thomas to help him make a test case, however, and on February 21, 1868, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> appointed Lorenzo Thomas Secretary of War and ordered the removal of Stanton from office. Thomas personally delivered <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> dismissal notice to Stanton, but the Secretary refused either to accept its legitimacy or to vacate the premises.

5000|$|The initial {{reaction}} of {{the opposition to the}} referendum proposal was that it was illegal. Henry Ramos, secretary general of the opposition party Acción Democrática called the proposal [...] " [...] 'illegal and unconstitutional' because Article 345 says that 'A revised constitutional reform initiative may not be submitted during the same constitutional term of office of the National Assembly.' [...] " [...] Chávez avoided this issue by declaring that the change to the constitution would be {{in the form of an}} amendment, instead of a constitutional reform. In addition, the constitutional amendment was re-defined to apply to all popular elected positions, not just to <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Elenis Rodríguez Martínez, a leader of the opposition party Primero Justicia, stated that the proposed change constitutes a fundamental change to the constitution, and therefore cannot be voted as an amendment. She stated that, [...] "Under Article 340, 'the purpose of an amendment is to add to or modify one or more articles of the Constitution, without altering the fundamental structure of the same.' When <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> wants to delete some words from Article 230 of the Constitution, he is lying, because he really wants to remove an essential part of the text and in doing so he is altering its structure, as well as part of the provisions of Article 6, which reads that 'the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is ... alternating' (...) This is a camouflaged reform." [...] However, the Constitutional Court ruled that such a change was within the scope of a constitutional amendment, and that such an amendment could be re-attempted each year. The editors of Venezuelan publishing house Veneconomy argue that the 15 February date is too soon to comply with time-frames set forth by the suffrage law and related laws for the registration of voters newly-turned-18 and for the organization of polling stations.|$|R
60|$|The episode {{would have}} been funny if the matter at stake had been a trifle; but in the {{circumstances}} it was pathetic. The usual storm was raging in the House.

Into this storm Count Falkenhayn entered, with his paper in his hand; and at once there was a rush to get near him and hear him read his motion. In a moment he was walled in by listeners. The several clauses of his motion were loudly applauded by these allies, and as loudly disapplauded--if I may invent a word--by such of the Opposition as could hear his voice. When he took his seat <b>the</b> <b>President</b> promptly put <b>the</b> motion--persons desiring to vote in the affirmative, stand up!

Stamps are earned by doing other cars favors such as deliveries or simply by visiting houses and also by completing mini-games. A secondary goal is completing your picture album. To take pictures you have to visit a Quick-Pic Shop appearing on the map with a black mark. After you take the picture, the owner (always a pink Toyota Vitz) will tell you where the next shop is located. The player must also, as another secondary objective, collect all 100 of the Choro Q coins located in every city (with the exception of Cloud Hill) around the world. Each of the cities contains a bar, where the owner will tell the player where to find the coins. Another goal is completing [...] "My City", your own city. To complete it, you must talk to many different cars in all the towns and sometimes they will ask you if you know somewhere {{to start a new life}} or to build their shops. After the city is completed, you should have, besides regular houses, a school, a Fire Department, a police station, and four factories (a Q's Factory, a Body Shop, a Parts Shop and a Paint Shop), among others.To qualify for the World Grand Prix, you must have two teammates and a Class Super A License. To acquire teammates, simply talk to other cars; if they can be recruited, they may ask you to consider allowing them to join your team. However, you must have won your first race before cars that will be your teammate will make you an offer. Of course, your teammates' qualities also depend on the parts you give them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} month, Capp {{was charged}} in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, {{in connection with}} another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [...] "sodomy." [...] As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} [...] "attempted adultery" [...] (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs. In a December 1992 article for The New Yorker, Seymour Hersh reported that President Richard Nixon and Charles Colson had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the National Archives. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate. [...] "Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public," [...] Hersh wrote. [...] "The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured <b>the</b> <b>President</b> by <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors." [...] Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge. In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.|$|R

[...] The {{testimony}} of Monica Lewinsky 2 ̆ 7 s mother Marcia Lewis, who {{was granted a}} reprieve today from further grand jury testimony due to emotional duress, is like 2 ̆ 2 manna from heaven 2 ̆ 2 for Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, says Professor Ron Carlson, a criminal law expert at the University of Georgia. Starr 2 ̆ 7 s strategy is obvious, says Carlson: drill the mother on all the important points {{of the case and}} have a loaded gun trained on Lewinsky. 2 ̆ 2 And it will all be set when Monica comes before that grand jury, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 She will have virtually no wiggle room. To have the mother come in before the key witness to lay this kind of groundwork, it will form for Starr a superb template on which to then proceed with the Monica Lewinsky interrogation. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson expects Lewinsky to appear before the grand jury next week, and he predicts that she will be granted use immunity [...] not a free pass from ever being prosecuted, but protection from criminal charges stemming from her grand jury testimony. Carlson says the success of Starr 2 ̆ 7 s case hinges on the talking points memo, 2 ̆ 2 the most important single piece of evidence in the case so far. 2 ̆ 2 However, current secret service agents should not be coerced to testify against <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>says</b> Carlson. <b>He</b> believes executive privilege should be invoked to protect him. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s very unwise policy to dragoon secret service agents before tribunals such as grand juries, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They are sworn to protect <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> These kinds of efforts compromise, it seems to me, that duty to a certain extent in the sense that requiring them to go to court or to grand juries and to reveal disclosures they overheard because of their private position with <b>the</b> <b>president</b> will cause <b>the</b> <b>president</b> to avoid having secret service around all the time, particularly when he 2 ̆ 7 s looking at having very confidential discussions with foreign leaders. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court.
