5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E

In September, several deputies introduced a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> parent's homosexuality legal grounds for denial of parental rights.

25|$|On his death, Sir Harry Campion bequeathed {{half the}} residue of his estate to the Royal Statistical Society, who decided to commemorate him and the {{prominent}} part {{he played in the}} development of official statistics through a Fellowship. The Campion Fellowship ia awarded every two years with the maximum sum of money available on any occasion being £10,000, to Fellows of the Society to promote a specific piece of work or project <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> significant contribution to the development, use or exposition of statistics on the economic or social well being of the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} nursing means that nursing ethics tends {{to examine the}} ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by {{exploring}} the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care. Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the virtues <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct {{in relation to the}} person in the nurse's care. In recent times, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights and dignity of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses, such as in the latest code from the International Council of Nurses.|$|E
25|$|The model rocket kits were {{a modest}} success and MITS {{wanted to try}} a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of Popular Electronics {{featured}} the Opticom, a kit from MITS that would send voice over an LED light beam. Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business so Roberts bought his partners out, then began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had just announced a set of six LSI integrated circuit chips <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the chip set and was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. This calculator kit sold for $175 ($275 assembled). Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others {{over the next several}} years. He often accepted a copy of the kit as payment.|$|E

25|$|Belgrano's {{task in the}} north, same as his {{previous}} one in Paraguay, was part politics and part military; they counted on him to restore the morale on the region and try to disarm the local royalists among the population, {{many of whom were}} priests or rich citizens. He was preferred for the post, instead of other more experienced or capable officers as Eustaquio Díaz Vélez or Juan Ramón Balcarce, both colonels at the time and veterans of many battles. Among the junior officers there were several <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> name for themselves such as José María Paz, Manuel Dorrego and Gregorio Aráoz de La Madrid. While in Salta, he would receive the help of Baron Holmberg, veteran artillery man from the European wars, who would take charge of his meager artillery —only two cannon at first— and would give help on strategic planning.|$|E

Ament said, [...] "We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had {{to put it in}} sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E

Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

500|$|Nicole Perlman, who was {{enrolled}} in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009, was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on. Out of those, Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning's Guardians of the Galaxy, due to her interest in space and science fiction, adding, [...] "I think [...] were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians, because there were ones <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> lot more sense {{if you were a}} romantic-comedy writer or something like that." [...] Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the Guardians universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script. Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because [...] "it didn’t work" [...] for him; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel. Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no Walkman; he stated, [...] "In Nicole’s script everything is pretty different... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the WGA works. They like first writers an awful lot." [...] In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script, however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.|$|E

50|$|The last {{phase of}} Baroque {{architecture}} in Italy is exemplified by Luigi Vanvitelli's Caserta Palace, reputedly the largest building erected in Europe in the 18th century. Indebted to contemporary French and Spanish models, the palace is skillfully {{related to the}} landscape. At Naples and Caserta, Vanvitelli practiced a sober and classicizing academic style, with equal attention to aesthetics and engineering, <b>a</b> style <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> easy transition to Neoclassicism.|$|R
2500|$|General Winfield Scott {{was one of}} the few senior men in Washington who {{realized}} that this could be a long war, and he developed an appropriate naval strategy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decisive impact on the war's outcome. This was part of his famous Anaconda Plan that employed a naval blockade around the coastline of the Confederacy with the idea of adversely affecting its economy and supply lines. Because of the thousands of miles of coastline, with its many rivers, bays and inlets, the blockade proved largely ineffectual during the first couple of years of the war. [...] This allowed blockade runners to import military supplies to the Confederacy with relative ease. Deliveries of armaments and military supplies to the South and cotton to England were coordinated by military agents like Major Walker, who played a key role in supplying the Confederacy.|$|E
2500|$|The lesser {{form of the}} Larry Bird {{exception}} is the [...] "early Bird" [...] exception. Free agents who qualify for this exception are called [...] "early qualifying veteran free agents", and qualify after playing two seasons with the same team. Players that are traded or claimed off waivers have their Bird rights transferred to their new team. Prior to an arbitrator ruling in June 2012, all players that were waived and changed teams lost their Bird rights. Using this exception, a team can re-sign its own free agent for either 175% of his salary the previous season, or the NBA's average salary, whichever is greater. Early Bird contracts must be {{for at least two}} seasons, but can last no longer than four seasons. If a team agrees to a trade <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> player lose his Early Bird Rights, he has the power to veto the trade.|$|E
