Using the knowledge from the literary study and the simulation environments used, we have reached the maximum analysis of the problem. The separation of metal and plastic may occur due to temperature changes if the temperature difference is sufficient. We have carried out a study of printed circuit board production so we can choose the appropriate path of separation. Furthermore, we calculated the shear stress size required to tear the conductive copper paths from the epoxy resin. The temperature field in a <b>two-layer</b> <b>board</b> was modeled in the FEMLAB and Pro/ENGINEER programming environments. From the simulated temperature field simulations, conclusions can be drawn that accurately describe the condition and characteristics of materials subjected to heat shock. They derived the resulting relationship for calculating the resulting shear stress needed to separate the conductive paths and plastic materials of the PCB. In our own experiments, we used several ways to heat PCBs. The temperature is also sufficient for the separation of tin. After using the mechanical separation of the components, they were dropped from the PCB. Mechanical separation was also used when removing conductive paths. This separation is effective, but in the newer types of PCBs, the cyclical effects of thermal shock have {{to be applied to}} the separation of copper paths. Laboratory tests have demonstrated the viability of the proposed solution. The proposed method of recycling could lead to industrial use, which requires consistent sorting of waste electrical and electronic equipment...|$|E

Using <b>two-layer</b> <b>boards</b> with non-fixed dimensions the algorithm always defines all the desired connections. It is al so able to accept any component whose pins are on the boundary of a rectangle. The algorithm is non-cellular the connections are stablished macroscopically on a grid with a small number of rows and columns, where each component corresponds to an intersection. This approach yields great savings in memory space and computing time. The spacing between components is initially assumed unlimited, capable of supporting any number of connections. The actual number of connections in the macroscopic cells is determined by the algorithm and only then the final location of each component is established thus defining the dimensions of the boar...|$|R
40|$|The new readout {{electronics}} for the electromagnetic calorimeter TAPS [1] {{was developed by}} members of the TAPS collaboration at Gießen, KVI and Basel. The concept of the 4 channel readout module is a 4 -fold integration of the BaF 2 signal to provide the separate information of the long and short scintillation components in two different dynamic ranges. A CFD optimizes the timing information obtained by the TAC and guarantees accurate integration gates necessary for pulseshape analysis. 2 LEDs allow more sophisticated trigger conditions. A PLD provides the slow control. These combined analog and digital functions are implemented on a piggyback residing on a commercial VME motherboard, developed by the HADES collaboration (CAEN V 874). A prototype version (4 boards comprising only 2 channels each on <b>two-layer</b> <b>boards</b> assembled with several plugins) was tested in a parasitic experiment at the MAMI tagged photon facility at Mainz to study the achievable energy and time resolutions [2]. The test has shown the functionality of the new electronics, but the detailed analysis of the response of the individual modules has revealed a non-linearity of the measured energy towards higher energies. Laboratory tests with test pulses, simulating the shape of BaF 2 signals, have been performed. Covering a maximum attenuation factor of deviation of linearity [%...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Design and {{manufacturing}} techniques of {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB's) have advanced from early one or two-layer structures to the multilayer boards where ten or more layers are no longer uncommon. These give additional routing space, potential decrease in device size and various design possibilities like solid ground and power planes. Unfortunately multilayer boards are vulnerable to high coupling between signal vias especially due to PCB resonances. In this study via crosscoupling is investigated on multilayer PCB's. Special attention {{is given to the}} coupling due to resonances and vertically aligned blind vias. Problem is approached from the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) point of view and high accuracy of measurements or models is not the objective. Instead ways to increase isolation are considered important. EMC is considered to include internal functionality of the device. Analytical methods are used to calculate resonant frequencies, fields and quality factors for simple rectangular structures. The PCB cavity is reduced to two-dimensions for numerical calculation of same quantities. Aplac finite-difference time-domain simulator is used to model coupling due to PCB resonances. Isolation between vertically aligned blind vias is estimated analytically. A quasi-static numerical model is used to study a coaxial via structure. Multilayer test boards are constructed for measurement purposes. Simplified resonator structures on <b>two-layer</b> <b>boards</b> are used to test different methods to increase isolation. Measurements show that high coupling between vias may occur due to PCB resonances. This leads to the situation, where previously used isolation methods between vias are not necessarily effective enough. Several means to reduce effects of PCB resonances are described in this study. Measured and modelled results agree well from an EMC point of view. Coupling due to vertically aligned blind vias is also shown to be high. A simple capacitance model may be used to approximate this up to frequencies where the dynamic wave nature of the board starts to be important. From a PCB designer's point of view these results mean that when the board size is not small compared to the wavelength, there is a possibility of resonances and reduction methods have to be taken into account. Also placement of the vias have to be carefully selected especially if blind or buried vias are used...|$|R

40|$|A hierarchically regularized coupled set of time-domain {{surface and}} volume {{electric}} field integral-equations (TD-S-EFIE and TD-V-EFIE) for analyzing electromagnetic wave interactions with electrically small and geometrically intricate composite structures comprising perfect electrically conducting surfaces and finite dielectric volumes is presented. A classically formulated coupled set of TD-S- and V-EFIEs {{is shown to}} be ill-conditioned at low frequencies owing to the hypersingular nature of the TD-S-EFIE. To eliminate low-frequency breakdown in marching-on-in-time solvers for these coupled equations, a hierarchical regularizer leveraging generalized RaoWiltonGlisson functions {{is applied to the}} TD-S-EFIE; no regularization is applied to the TD-V-EFIE as it is protected from low-frequency breakdown by an identity term. The resulting hierarchically regularized hybrid TD-S- and V-EFIE solver is applicable to the analysis of wave interactions with electrically small and densely meshed structures of arbitrary topology. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the proposed solver are demonstrated by analyzing crosstalk in a six-port transmission line, radiation from a miniature radio-frequency identification antenna, and, plane-wave coupling onto a partially-shielded and fully loaded <b>two-layer</b> computer <b>board.</b> © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

Työ on jaettu kirjallisuusosaan ja kokeelliseen osaan. Kirjallisuusosassa esitellään nykyisin käytetyt aaltopahvin raaka-aineet, aaltoprofiilit ja aaltopahvin valmistusprosessi sekä raaka-aineiden ja valmiin aaltopahvin testausmenetelmät ja tärkeät ominaisuudet. Kokeellinen osa koostuu laboratoriokokeista, pilot-koeajoista ja aaltopahvin valmistuksesta. Kokeellisen osan laboratoriovaiheessa käytetty massa fraktioitiin lyhyeen ja pitkään fraktioon. Lyhyestä ja pitkästä fraktioista valmistettiin eri fraktio-osuuksilla yksi- ja kaksikerrosarkkeja. Laboratorioarkkien neliömassa-alue oli 70 - 125 g/m 2. Lisäksi muuttujana oli tiheys. Laboratoriomittausten perusteella parhaimmat rakenteet valittiin ajettavaksi pilot-mittakaavan koekartonkikoneella. Koekoneella valmistetuista yksi- ja kaksikerroskartongeista valmistettiin tehdasmittakaavassa F-aaltopahvia ja saadut rakenneyhdistelmät testattiin. Koetulosten perusteella voidaan sanoa, että mikroaaltolainerille on olemassa optimaalinen rakenne, joka riippuu painotettavasta ominaisuudesta. Pintaominaisuuksien painottaminen johtaa erilaiseen rakenteeseen kuin lujuusominaisuuksien painottaminen. Myös lainerin käyttökohde (pinta- tai taustalaineri) johtaa erilaiseen optimaaliseen rakenteeseen. The {{purpose of}} this master's thesis was {{to find out what}} kind of linerboards should be used in microflutes and which {{properties}} are required of them. This thesis consists of literary and experimental sections. The literary section deals with the raw materials, profiles and the manufacturing process of the corrugated board. The different testing methods and the important properties of these raw materials and the finished corrugated board are also introduced. The experimental section includes the presentation of laboratory tests, pilot test runs and manufacturing of the corrugated board. The stock used at the laboratory stage was fractioned into short and long fractions. Both these fractions were used to produce one- and two-layer sheets with different fraction proportions. The laboratory sheets had grammages between 70 - 125 g/m 2. In addition, density was examined as one variable. On the basis of the laboratory measurements, the best structures were chosen to be processed by Anjalankoski PM 3 pilot machine. The one- and <b>two-layer</b> <b>boards</b> manufactured by the pilot machine were converted into F-flute and the given structure combinations were then tested in the laboratory. The tests showed that there is an optimal structure of linerboard used for microflute corrugated boards. The optimal structure depends on properties to be emphazised. When targeting to the best surface properties the optimal structure of linerboard is not the best in terms of strength properties. Also, the strongest structure does not give the best surface properties. Optimal structure depends also on purpose of use i. e. whether the linerboard is aimed to be surface or back liner of the corrugated board...|$|R
