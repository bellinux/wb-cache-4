5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of an}} American Cocker Spaniel {{makes the}} breed {{immediately}} recognizable, with <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed granitic {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E

5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{construction}} of the castle walls, three round towers were built on the north, east, and west towers. The north tower, or donjon, is the largest, comprising three or four storeys originally, and probably housed the lord's private apartments. The west tower is almost internal, barely projecting beyond <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> corner of the curtain wall, and could only be entered via the parapet walk. The basement level contains a pit prison which was accessed from above. The east tower was almost completely rebuilt in the late 15th century as a gatehouse. Each tower was probably once topped by a conical roof.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E

2500|$|From 1985 to 2010, <b>the</b> <b>round</b> {{consisting}} of 64 teams and 32 games {{was called the}} [...] "first round", while <b>the</b> <b>round</b> {{consisting of}} 32 teams and 16 games was called the [...] "second round".

5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. <b>The</b> <b>rounded</b> walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding around the room on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the inner bailey, with its wall studded with {{semi-circular}} projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual {{design of the}} inner bailey's curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance when Edward I of England—who had himself been on Crusade—built castles in Wales in the late 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded were concentric.|$|E
50|$|When one of {{the teams}} reaches 11 points, they play <b>the</b> mão-de-onze (<b>round</b> of eleven). In this <b>round,</b> <b>the</b> members of each team can see their partner's cards before <b>the</b> <b>round</b> begins and <b>the</b> team with eleven points may choose to play <b>the</b> <b>round</b> of run away. If they choose to play, <b>the</b> <b>round</b> is worth three points. If they choose to run away, the {{opposing}} team is awarded one point. If any of the players ask for truco during <b>the</b> <b>round</b> of eleven, <b>the</b> team loses <b>the</b> <b>round.</b> For this reason, if {{one of the}} players is dealt an unbeatable hand (having the two best cards at the same time) they may simply show the cards {{to the rest of the}} table and win <b>the</b> <b>round</b> without having to play. If both teams reach eleven points, <b>the</b> <b>round</b> must be played.|$|R

5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. <b>The</b> <b>rounded</b> and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} procedure {{also works}} with additions of {{both positive and}} negative summands: One rounds one summand after the other the usual way, but adds the accumulated rounding error to the next summand before rounding it. When rounding the first number, the difference between the original number and <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> number may be positive, negative or zero. One adds this difference to the second number before rounding it.
