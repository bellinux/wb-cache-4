5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} {{is that of}} a remote and {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial English Midlands lay in <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden.|$|E

5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing and {{harvesting}} reached <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> soil of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{seasonal}} high rainfall in the Shinano's watershed <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> farmlands on the Niigata plain {{were subjected}} to flooding every {{three to four years}} which destroyed crops, particularly rice, and villages. Attempts from local residents to secure funding to build a diversion channel began in the mid-early eighteenth century, during the Kyōhō era. Government support was not secured until the early twentieth century following severe flooding and inundation in 1896.|$|E
5|$|For {{the ancient}} Mediterraneans, saffron {{gathered}} around the Cilician coastal town of Soli was of top value, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments. Herodotus and Pliny the Elder, however, rated rival Assyrian and Babylonian saffron from <b>the</b> <b>Fertile</b> Crescent as bestto treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets. Greek saffron from the Corycian Cave of Mount Parnassus was also of note: the color offered by the Corycian crocus {{is used as a}} benchmark in the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of Martial.|$|E

5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually.

It {{is often described as}} inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1537, Montejo sent {{reinforcements}} to Cáceres, who {{was still}} in <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> Valley of Comayagua. By late spring or early summer, the valley had been completely conquered. In December 1537, under orders from Montejo, Alonso de Cáceres founded the town of Santa María de Comayagua; it was sited in a strategic position half-way between the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Cáceres then distributed the Indian settlements in encomienda. He collected reinforcements from Gracias a Dios, then returned immediately to Comayagua, and began to push eastwards towards Olancho.|$|E

More small-scale industrial units are situated in Uttar Pradesh than in any other state, with 12 per cent of over 2.3 million units. With 359 manufacturing clusters, cement is the top sector of SMEs in UP.|$|E
5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is {{bisected}} by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The Hoysala rulers were {{originally}} from Malenadu, an elevated {{region in the}} Western Ghats.

5|$|The Hupa {{lived in}} <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> Hoopa Valley along the Trinity River and the Hyampom Valley on the South Fork – {{some of the}} few flat lands in a region {{otherwise}} dominated by rugged mountains. A Hupa village called Weitspus stood {{at the site of}} present-day Weitchpec at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The Hupa traded with the coastal Yurok and Karok by using canoes to navigate the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The trade arrangements with neighboring tribes were complex and involved the use of dentalium shells as currency.|$|E
5|$|The Mariotes worshiped both Semitic and Sumerian deities and {{established}} their {{city as a}} center of old trade. However, although the pre-Amorite periods were characterized by heavy Sumerian cultural influence, Mari was not a city of Sumerian immigrants but rather a Semitic speaking nation that used a dialect similar to Eblaite. The Amorites were West-Semites who began to settle the area before the 21st century BC; by the Lim dynasty's era (c. 1830 BC), they became the dominant population in <b>the</b> <b>Fertile</b> Crescent.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. <b>The</b> <b>fertile</b> floodplain of the Nile gave humans {{the opportunity to develop}} a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization. Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley {{through the end of the}} Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.|$|E
