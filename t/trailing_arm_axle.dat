50|$|The {{familiar}} {{range of}} PSA powertrains drove {{the front wheels}} of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-Citroën independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the Peugeot 305 estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers.

50|$|The {{body of the}} car was {{designed}} and marketed by Pininfarina with styling by Tom Tjaarda, The AS cars had a torque tube transmitting power to the rear wheels; this crack-prone design {{was replaced by a}} <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> rear <b>axle</b> with the second series (BS) during 1969. It was built alongside the AS {{for the first six months}} of 1970. The early AS cars also have somewhat smaller taillights, while the BS receives a mesh grille and black-rimmed gauges inside. In July 1970 the 1.6-liter BS1 appeared; this model is recognizable by its twin humps on the bonnet and bumper overriders. The CS series Spider arrived during 1972. Also in 1972, a sports version of the Spider debuted. This was required for a type-approval of its rally version, which earned some remarkable success. The models sold in showrooms were marked as 124 CSA (C-Spider-Abarth). The vehicle has a capacity of 128 hp. In three years, Fiat manufactured less than 1000 CSA models, which were intended for sale to individual clients.|$|R

5000|$|The Weissach axle is {{a variant}} of the {{semi-trailing}} arm suspension.

50|$|The Quattroporte was a four-door, five-seater saloon with a steel unibody construction.

50|$|The twist-beam rear {{suspension}} (also torsion-beam axle or deformable torsion beam) {{is a type}} of automobile suspension based on a large H or C shaped member.

The cross beam of the H holds the two <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> together, and provides the roll stiffness of the suspension, by twisting as the two <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> move vertically, relative to each other.|$|R

50|$|Front {{suspension}} of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers. Rear suspension was by a <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> was suspended by another torsional rubber spring.

40|$|We have selelcted 556 Red Horizontal Branch (RHB) stars {{along the}} streams of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) from SDSS DR 7 spectroscopic data using a {{theoretical}} model. The metallicity and α-elements distributions are investigated for {{stars in the}} Sgr streams and for Galactic stars at the same locations. We find that the Sgr stars have two peaks in the metallicity distribution while the Galactic stars have a more prominent metal-poor peak. Meanwhile, [α/Fe] ratios of the Sgr stars are {{lower than those of}} the Galactic stars. Among the Sgr stars, we find a difference in the metallicity distribution between the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>arms</b> of the Sgr tidal tails. The metallicity and [α/Fe] distribution of the leading arm {{is similar to that of}} the Galaxy. The <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> is composed mainly of a metal rich component and [α/Fe] is obviously lower than that of the Galactic stars. The metallicity gradient is -(1. 8 ± 0. 3) × 10 ^- 3 dex degree^- 1 in the first wrap of the <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> and -(1. 5 ± 0. 4) × 10 ^- 3 dex degree^- 1 in the first wrap of the leading arm. No significant gradient exists along the second wraps of the leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>arms.</b> It seems that the Sgr dwarf galaxy initially lost the metal poor component in the second wrap (older) arms due to the tidal force of our Galaxy and then the metal rich component is disrupted in the first wrap (younger) arms. Finally, we found that the velocity dispersion of the <b>trailing</b> <b>arm</b> from 88 ^∘<Λ_< 112 ^∘ is σ = 9. 808 ± 1. 0 km s^- 1, which is consistent with previous work in the literature.
