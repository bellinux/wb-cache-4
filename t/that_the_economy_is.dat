Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle.

Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.|$|E

[...] When Randy complains to the manager, he invests money in a portfolio, but the money also disappears (with the implication that the manager was transferring the money into his own account); a recession then hits the nation and South Park. At dinner, Randy explains to Stan <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> failing due to people spending their money on luxuries, and ironically, he continues his tirade while making himself a margarita in a Margaritaville-brand mixer, the noise of which drowns out his voice {{for part of the}} tirade.|$|E

A second important point was his philosophical and ethical treatment of economic issues, inspired on Catholic moral theology.|$|E

50|$|Efforts to {{modernize}} and to expand <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> {{together with a}} number of factors fostered strong economic growth in the 1980s.
