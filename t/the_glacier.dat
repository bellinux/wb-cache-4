5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were {{big enough to}} explore, like <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> caves on the summit of Mount Rainier. Most of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> were mapped and studied.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field near the top of <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> melts.|$|E
5|$|The Crater Glacier (also {{known as}} Tulutson Glacier) is a geologically young glacier that {{is located on}} Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington. <b>The</b> <b>glacier</b> formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown {{to the public for}} nearly 20 years. <b>The</b> <b>glacier</b> once {{contained}} ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of the lava dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> In the same time period, several agencies decided to put an official name on <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> which, at first, was Tulutson Glacier. A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name. Despite the volcanic activity, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> continued to advance and by mid-2008, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> completely encircled the lava domes. In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater Glacier as well.|$|E
50|$|Kronebreen {{merges with}} two other <b>glaciers,</b> <b>the</b> Kongsvegen <b>glacier</b> and <b>the</b> Conway <b>glacier.</b> <b>The</b> merged <b>glacier</b> ends up in Kongsfjorden, and <b>the</b> common <b>glacier</b> front is called Kongsbreen.|$|R
2500|$|Land below <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> [...] "rebounded" [...] {{as it was}} uncovered. Because <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> covered {{some areas}} longer than others, this glacial rebound {{occurred}} at different rates.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} analyzed aerial {{and satellite}} images from 1957, 1984, and 2009. They found that 10 out of 109 of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> of <b>the</b> Ahklun Mountains originally mapped by the U.S Geological Survey in the 1970s had completely disappeared. They also compared {{the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> using aerial photographs and satellite images and found that <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> had lost about 50 percent of their total area. At this rate of melting, they predict that all of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> in <b>the</b> Ahklun Mountains will be gone {{by the end of}} this century.|$|R
5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} the glaciers in <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E
5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> joined together in late May 2008 and thus <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
60|$|We find, moreover, on {{the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers,</b> moraines superieures--long lines of stones and dirt which had fallen from {{neighbouring}} cliffs, and are now travelling downward with <b>the</b> <b>glaciers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Talum <b>Glaciers</b> {{are located}} on the {{southeast}} slopes of Mount Baker in the North Cascades of the U.S. state of Washington. <b>The</b> <b>glaciers</b> are connected to Squak Glacier to the west.

During a cooler and wetter period from 1950 to 1979, <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> advanced 902 ft but between 1980 and 2006 retreated back 951 ft.|$|R

5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
5|$|A storm {{causes the}} ship to crash, and the group awakens to {{discover}} that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and that {{the leaders of the}} Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through <b>the</b> <b>glacier,</b> and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopean stairs {{can also}} form at points where {{tributary}} glaciers feed into larger central <b>glaciers.</b> <b>The</b> tributary <b>glacier</b> causes <b>the</b> central <b>glacier</b> to thicken and downcut more rapidly. This may cause a very sudden {{drop in the}} valley floor at the points where <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> converged.|$|R

50|$|The ridge {{was formed}} {{thousands}} of years ago as <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> that once covered Canada retreated. The area {{was one of the few}} parts of Canada to not be overrun by <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> during <b>the</b> last Ice Age.|$|R
5|$|Another {{team from}} the British Antarctic Survey arrived at the ice stream on 8 December 2006 {{for the first of}} two field seasons. In the second field season, they spent three months there from November 2007 to February 2008. Work on <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> {{included}} radar measurements and seismic surveys.|$|E
5|$|As the {{ice stream}} accelerates {{it is also}} getting steeper. The rate of {{thinning}} within the central trunk has quadrupled from 1995 to 2006. If {{the current rate of}} acceleration were to continue the main trunk of <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> could be afloat within 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Glacier Bay Basin {{in southeastern}} Alaska, in the United States, {{encompasses}} <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay and surrounding mountains and glaciers, which was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, {{and which was}} later, on December 2, 1980, enlarged and designated as <b>the</b> <b>Glacier</b> Bay National Park and Preserve under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, covering an area of 3,283,000 acres (1,329,000 ha). In 1986, UNESCO declared an area of 57,000 acres (23,000 ha) within a World Biosphere Reserve. This is the largest UNESCO protected biosphere in the world. In 1992, UNESCO included this area {{as a part of}} a World Heritage site, extending over an area of 24,300,000-acre (98,000km2) which also included the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, Kluane National Park (Canada) and Tatshenshini-Alsek Park (Canada).

40|$|In this {{research}} <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> and glaciated areas of northwest of Bolkar mountains and their geographical conditions have been studied. Recent debris-covered glaciers have been determined {{in the higher}} (> 2900 m) parts of north and, partially, northeast-facing cirques of two glaciated areas of Pleistocene. The surface area of <b>the</b> largest <b>glacier</b> (Medetsiz) of seven glaciers in Karagöl and Alişan Glaciated Areas is 0, 23 km 2. On the other hand, Eğerkaya East Glacier occupies a confined place of 0, 09 km 2. While all <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> display <b>the</b> evidence of glacial karst, the Kopukgöl Glacier has exceptionally three supraglacial lakes. In the light of previous data, it is concluded {{there have been no}} notable regression in the terminal of <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> that since last 60 years. Due to the presence of a debris cover over <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> that hampers supraglacially melting, it is possible to suggest that englacial and subglacial ablation should be accounted for of <b>the</b> ablation of <b>glaciers...</b>|$|R
5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a crevasse, they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> and ascended to the plateau.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b> This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, <b>the</b> <b>glacier</b> no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1912 Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, {{led by the}} geologist Cecil Madigan, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by Frank Stillwell, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and <b>the</b> <b>glacier.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>glaciers</b> {{that moved}} through the area gouged and tore at the bedrock, the cooled lava of ancient volcanoes.

It left low rolling hills with steep sides called moraines. Between <b>the</b> hills, <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> gouged valleys and in the larger valleys, lakes were formed.|$|R
50|$|Further {{evidence}} of the last Ice Age {{can also be seen}} at low tide, where the beach is dotted with large boulders known as glacial erratics - these were carried from a distance inside <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> and dropped into their current locations when <b>the</b> <b>glaciers</b> melted.|$|R
