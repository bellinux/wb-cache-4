The most computation-intensive part of these systems is searching thousands of patterns that must be performed on gigabits speeds. But software based IDS solution can not handle this task effectively {{and they are not}} able to archive throughput higher than 300 Mbps. This paper presents the system architecture of the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Scanner</b> which is hardware accelerated IDS based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The designed system supports rules described in Snort-compatible format and can be configured using a web interface. System uses an architecture based on non-deterministic finite automaton for fast pattern matching. Using this approach, throughput up to 3. 2 Gbps is achieved on the COMBO 6 X card for all rules from Snort database...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} measure and cost-effectively collect traffic data at road intersections {{is needed to}} improve their safety and operations. This study investigates the feasibility of using laser ranging technology (LiDAR) for this purpose. The proposed technology does not experience {{some of the problems}} of the current video-based technology but less expensive low-end sensors have limited density of points where measurements are collected that may bring new challenges. A novel LiDAR-based portable <b>traffic</b> <b>scanner</b> (TScan) is introduced in this report to detect and track various types of road users (e. g., trucks, cars, pedestrians, and bicycles). The scope of this study included the development of a signal processing algorithm and a user interface, their implementation on a TScan research unit, and evaluation of the unit performance to confirm its practicality for safety and traffic engineering applications. The TScan research unit was developed by integrating a Velodyne HDL- 64 E laser scanner within the existing Purdue University Mobile Traffic Laboratory which has a telescoping mast, video cameras, a computer, and an internal communications network. The low-end LiDAR sensor’s limited resolution of data points was further reduced by the distance, the light beam absorption on dark objects, and the reflection away from the sensor on oblique surfaces. The motion of the LiDAR sensor located {{at the top of the}} mast caused by wind and passing vehicles was accounted for with the readings from an inertial sensor atop the LiDAR. These challenges increased the need for an effective signal processing method to extract the maximum useful information. The developed TScan method identifies and extracts the background with a method applied in both the spherical and orthogonal coordinates. The moving objects are detected by clustering them; then the data points are tracked, first as clusters and then as rectangles fit to these clusters. After tracking, the individual moving objects are classified in categories, such as heavy and non-heavy vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. The resulting trajectories of the moving objects are stored for future processing with engineering applications. The developed signal-processing algorithm is supplemented with a convenient user interface for setting and running and inspecting the results during and after the data collection. In addition, one engineering application was developed in this study for counting moving objects at intersections. Another existing application, the Surrogate Safety Analysis Model (SSAM), was interfaced with the TScan method to allow extracting traffic conflicts and collisions from the TScan results. A user manual also was developed to explain the operation of the system and the application of the two engineering applications. Experimentation with the computational load and execution speed of the algorithm implemented on the MATLAB platform indicated that the use of a standard GPU for processing would permit real-time running of the algorithms during data collection. Thus, the post-processing phase of this method is less time consuming and more practical. Evaluation of the TScan performance was evaluated by comparing to the best available method: video frame-by-frame analysis with human observers. The results comparison included counting moving objects; estimating the positions of the objects, their speed, and direction of travel; and counting interactions between moving objects. The evaluation indicated that the benchmark method measured the vehicle positions and speeds at the accuracy comparable to the TScan performance. It was concluded that the TScan performance is sufficient for measuring traffic volumes, speeds, classifications, and traffic conflicts. The traffic interactions extracted by SSAM required automatic post-processing to eliminate vehicle interactions at too low speed and between pedestrians – events that could not be recognized by SSAM. It should be stressed that this post processing does not require human involvement. Nighttime conditions, light rain, and fog did not reduce the quality of the results. Several improvements of this new method are recommended and discussed in this report. The recommendations include implementing two TScan units at large intersections and adding the ability to collect traffic signal indications during data collection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Early Detection, Alert and Response (eDare) {{system is}} aimed at purifying Web traffic {{propagating}} via the premises of Network Service Providers (NSP) from malicious code. To achieve this goal, the system employs powerful network <b>traffic</b> <b>scanners</b> capable of cleaning traffic from known malicious code. The remaining traffic is monitored and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are invoked {{in an attempt to}} pinpoint unknown malicious code exhibiting suspicious morphological patterns. Decision trees, Neural Networks and Bayesian Networks are used for static code analysis in order to determine whether a suspicious executable file actually inhabits malicious code. These algorithms are being evaluated and preliminary results are encouraging...|$|R

Our experimental set up {{consists of a}} truck equipped with one camera and two fast, inexpensive 2 D laser scanners, being driven on city streets under normal <b>traffic</b> conditions. One <b>scanner</b> is mounted vertically to capture building facades, {{and the other one}} is mounted horizontally. Successive horizontal scans are matched with each other in order to determine an estimate of the vehicle's motion, and relative motion estimates are concatenated to form an initial path. Assuming that features such as buildings are visible from both ground-based and airborne view, this initial path is globally corrected by Monte-Carlo Localization techniques. Specifically, the final global pose is obtained by utilizing an aerial photograph or a Digital Surface Model as a global map, to which the ground-based horizontal laser scans are matched. A fairly accurate, textured 3 D cof the downtown Berkeley area has been acquired in a matter of minutes, limited only by traffic conditions during the data acquisition phase. Subsequent automated processing time to accurately localize the acquisition vehicle is 235 minutes for a 37 minutes or 10. 2 km drive, i. e. 23 minutes per kilometer...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Automated data {{collection}} technology {{has transformed the}} city. From sensors that measure <b>traffic</b> flow to <b>scanners</b> that help police officers locate stolen vehicles, the use of smart city sensor networks has {{become an integral part}} of the modern city. Because the sensor networks collect highly detailed information about every aspect of city life, data from the sensor networks is often linked to individuals and can potentially be used to develop detailed profiles on residents. This thesis defines and identifies threats to locational privacy and identifies three major approaches to mitigating privacy risk: the use of tiered data structures modeled on IRB reviews; the use of privacy by design principles to minimize privacy-adverse {{data collection}}; and amendments to policy and law that would help to create a regulatory environment favorable to individual and societal privacy protection. This thesis involves case study research and interviews with program managers at the City of Seattle Policy Department, the City of Seattle Department of Transportation, and Sound Transit. It considers the locational privacy implications of automated license plate readers, WiFi beacon sniffer networks, and RFID transit passes. It concludes that locational privacy protection will require a careful blend of policy, law, and system design that is tailored both to the technology and to the larger political and legal environment in which the sensor network operates...|$|R
40|$|Network attacks often employ {{scanning}} {{to locate}} vulnerable hosts and services. Unimpeded scanning {{can lead to}} the subversion of an entire vulnerable population in a matter of minutes. Fast and accurate detection of local scanners is key to contain a spreading epidemic in its early stage. Existing scan detection schemes can detect fast scanners whose behavior can be clearly delineated from that of legitimate <b>traffic.</b> Detecting slow <b>scanners,</b> however, is more difficult. The difficulty arises partially from the fact that these detection schemes use statically determined detection criteria, and as a result do not respond well to traffic perturbations. In this paper, we present two adaptive scan detection schemes, Success Based (SB) and Failure Based (FB), both of which change detection criteria dynamically based on traffic statistics. FB is designed for fast detection and is particularly well suited for controlled computing environments with well-understood traffic characteristics. SB is more versatile and able to perform well {{in a wide range of}} traffic scenarios. We evaluate the proposed schemes analytically as well as empirically using real traffic and attack traces. Our results show that against fast scanners, the adaptive schemes are able to render similar detection precision as the traditional static schemes. For slow scanners, however, the adaptive schemes are much more effective, both in terms of detection precision and speed. Specifically, both SB and FB have non-linear properties not present in other schemes. These properties permit a lower Sustained Scanning Threshold and a robustness against perturbations in the background traffic...|$|R
