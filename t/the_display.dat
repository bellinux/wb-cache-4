5|$|Ace (stylized as ACE as {{acronym for}} Air Combat Emulator) is a flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Cascade Games for various home computers released in 1985. The player takes {{the role of}} a fighter jet pilot defending an English coastland against an enemy invasion, having to fight off aerial, ground and naval forces while Allied bases evacuate. <b>The</b> <b>display</b> shows the plane's instrumentation and cockpit view.|$|E
5|$|All GameCube {{systems support}} <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of {{stereoscopic}} 3D, and Luigi's Mansion {{was developed to}} utilize this feature. However, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was never enabled outside of development.|$|E
40|$|Producing {{seamless}} tiled {{images from}} multiple displays includes measuring a luminance profile {{of each of}} <b>the</b> <b>displays,</b> computing a desired luminance profile for each of <b>the</b> <b>displays,</b> and determining a spatial gradient profile of each of <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> based on <b>the</b> measured luminance profile and the computed desired luminance profile. The determined spatial gradient profile is applied to a spatial filter to be inserted into each of <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> to produce <b>the</b> seamless tiled <b>display</b> image...|$|R
5000|$|An English auction is an dynamic [...] "open outcry" [...] auction. Here, <b>the</b> <b>displayed</b> {{price is}} {{increased}} by bidders shouting prices above <b>the</b> <b>displayed</b> price, {{rather than by}} the auctioneer's clock. At first glance, this seems equivalent to the Japanese auction: apparently, it is a dominant strategy for each buyer whose price is above <b>the</b> <b>displayed</b> price, to always bid the minimal allowed increment (e.g. one cent) above <b>the</b> <b>displayed</b> price. However, in practice, jump bidding is often observed: buyers increase <b>the</b> <b>displayed</b> price much more than the minimal allowed increment. Obviously, jump-bidding is not possible in a Japanese auction. This may be seen as either an advantage or a disadvantage of the Japanese auction format.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>displays</b> were {{designed}} by Arch E. Baranger, Hazel J. Baranger and Robert Gerlach and manufactured in runs of about 30 each. A total of 167 different designs were produced. <b>The</b> <b>displays</b> were never sold but rented to jewellers under a contract in which <b>the</b> <b>displays</b> were rotated monthly, each jeweller returning the old one and receiving a new one to display.|$|R

5|$|Between 1820 and 1829 Etty {{exhibited}} 15 paintings, {{of which}} 14 depicted nude figures.

5|$|Both spiders and {{scorpions}} are venomous, {{so their}} threat displays can be considered generally aposematic. However, some predators such as hedgehogs and spider-hunting wasps (Pompilidae) actively hunt arachnids, overcoming their defences, so when a hedgehog is startled by, for instance, the sounds made by a scorpion, {{there is reason to}} describe <b>the</b> <b>display</b> as deimatic.|$|E

5|$|By {{ordering}} <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of {{one part}} of Koppány's quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, {{the seat of his}} maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, <b>the</b> <b>display</b> is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, <b>the</b> <b>display</b> is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of <b>the</b> <b>display</b> to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that <b>the</b> <b>display</b> looked continuous.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{the social}} {{interaction}} model, we examine the mediating role that <b>the</b> customer’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions plays {{on the relationship between}} <b>the</b> employee’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions and the employee’s positive mood. We also examine the moderating role that the customer’s personality traits—agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability—play on the relationship between <b>the</b> employee’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions and <b>the</b> customer’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions. The results show that <b>the</b> customer’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions mediates the relation-ship between <b>the</b> employee’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions and the employee’s positive mood. In addition, the customer’s personality traits moderate the relationship between <b>the</b> employee’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions and <b>the</b> customer’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions. <b>The</b> customer’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions depends less on <b>the</b> employee’s <b>display</b> of positive emotions when the customer has high levels of agreeableness and emotional stability than when the customer has low levels of agreeableness and emotional stability...|$|R

5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E
