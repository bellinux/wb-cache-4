40|$|HIV {{undergoes}} rapid genetic variation; this {{variation is}} caused {{primarily by the}} enormous number of viruses produced daily in an infected individual. Because of this variation, HIV presents a moving target for drug and vaccine development. The variation within individuals {{has led to the}} generation of diverse HIV- 1 subtypes, which further complicates the development of effective drugs and vaccines. In general, it is more difficult to hit a moving target than a stationary target. Two broad strategies for hitting a moving target (in this case, HIV replication) are to understand the movement and to aim at the portions that move the least. In the case of anti-HIV drug development, the first option can be addressed by understanding the mechanism(s) of drug resistance and developing drugs <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> mutant viruses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) post-transla-tional {{modification}} {{is essential}} for diverse cellular functions, including regulation of transcription, response to DNA damage, and mitosis. Cellular PAR is predominantly synthesized by the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1). PARP- 1 is a critical node in the DNA damage response pathway, and multiple potent PARP- 1 inhibitors have been described, some of which show considerable promise in the clinic {{for the treatment of}} certain cancers. Cellular PAR is efficiently degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), an enzyme for which no potent, readily accessible, and specific inhibitors exist. Herein we report the discovery of small molecules <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> PARG in vitro and in cellular lysates.

40|$|Tubulin-targeting {{molecules}} {{are widely}} used cancer therapeutic agents. They inhibit microtubule-based structures, including the mitotic spindle, ultimately preventing cell division. The final fates of microtubule-inhibited cells are however often heterogeneous and difficult to predict. While recent work has provided insight into the cell response to inhibitors of microtubule dynamics (taxanes), the cell response to tubulin polymerization inhibitors remains less well characterized. Arylthioindoles (ATIs) are recently developed tubulin inhibitors. We previously identified ATI members <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> tubulin polymerization in vitro and cancer cell growth in bulk cell viability assays. Here we characterise in depth the response of cancer cell lines to five selected ATIs.

Individual ATIs induce cytological phenotypes of increasing severity in terms of damage to the mitotic apparatus. That differentially triggers MCL- 1 down-regulation and caspase- 3 activation, and underlies the terminal fate of treated cells.

40|$|Innate immune {{mechanisms}} of defense are {{especially important to}} ectothermic vertebrates in which adaptive immune responses may be slow to develop. One innate defense in amphibian skin is the release of abundant quantities of antimicrobial peptides. Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused by the skin fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Susceptibility to chytridiomycosis varies among species, and {{mechanisms of}} disease resistance are not well understood. Previously, we have shown that Australian and Panamanian amphibian species that possess skin peptides <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> the growth of B. dendrobatidis in vitro tend to survive better in the wild or are predicted to survive the first encounter with this lethal pathogen. For most species, it {{has been difficult to}} experimentally infect individuals with B. dendrobatidis and directly evaluate both survival and antimicrobial peptide defenses.

We also observed that circulating granulocyte, but not lymphocyte, counts differed between infected and uninfected Lit. chloris. This suggests that innate granulocyte defenses may be activated by pathogen exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that multiple innate defense mechanisms are involved in resistance to chytridiomycosis, and the efficacy of these defenses varies by amphibian species...|$|E

The parameters that affect efficacy of binding of these inhibitors to the bc 1 complex are not well understood. Atovaquone®, a hydroxy-naphthoquinone, has been used therapeutically to treat Pneumocystis carinii and Plasmodium infections. As the pathogens have developed resistance to this drug, {{it is important to}} understand the molecular basis of the drug resistance and to develop new drugs that can circumvent the drug resistance. We previously developed the yeast and bovine bc 1 complexes as surrogates to model the interaction of atovaquone with the bc 1 complexes of the target pathogens and human host.

Because a selective inhibitor of the APE redox function has potential as a novel anticancer therapeutic, new analogues of E 3330 were synthesized. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the interactions of the analogues (RN 8 - 51, 10 - 52, and 7 - 60) with APE 1. RN 10 - 52 and RN 7 - 60 were found to react rapidly with APE 1, forming covalent adducts, whereas RN 8 - 51 reacted reversibly. Median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 values of all three compounds were significantly {{lower than that of}} E 3330. EMSA, transactivation assays, and endothelial tube growth-inhibition analysis demonstrated the specificity of E 3330 and its analogues in blocking the APE 1 redox function and demonstrated that the analogues had up to a sixfold greater effect than did E 3330. Studies using cancer cell lines demonstrated that E 3330 and one analogue, RN 8 - 51, decreased the cell line growth with little apoptosis, whereas the third, RN 7 - 60, caused a dramatic effect.

40|$|Abstract Background Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are {{double-stranded}} RNAs <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> {{expression of}} its complimentary target mRNA. Standard siRNAs contain two nucleotide overhangs on their 3 ' end. While these overhangs are usually comprised of deoxythymidines (dT), {{it has been}} shown that any nucleotide can be used on the 3 ' end without affecting RNAi silencing. Results It was recently shown that extension of the 3 ' end to five or eight dT molecules allows siRNAs to be effectively complexed with linear polyethylenimine (PEI), leading to enhanced cellular uptake and intracellular release. Here, we provide further evidence that only extended or 'sticky' siRNAs complexed with PEI result in significant target knockdown. However, when investigating the potential effects of these extended siRNAs on growth of human colon cancer RKO cells, we observed a dose-dependent reversal of cytotoxicity of a thymidylate synthase-targeted siRNA. In contrast, siRNAs with uridine overhangs maintained their growth inhibitory effects. We further demonstrated that dT-containing siRNAs prevented the cytotoxic effects of thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor compounds, such as ZD 1694 and 5 '-fluoro-deoxyuridine, while having no deleterious effect on cisplatin toxicity. We show that this rescue effect results from the rapid degradation of the siRNA. Conclusions Given that TS is an important enzyme for cell growth and proliferation and that its expression is controlled by multiple pathways, the rescue of its growth inhibitory effects may have unintended consequences. As siRNAs are being developed as therapeutic molecules, it will be important to avoid such off-target effects due to dT release. Hence, siRNAs should contain only uridine residues in their 3 '-end overhangs. </p...|$|E

Elucidation of the binding site of Icmt will allow the development of therapeutics <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> Icmt causing the mislocalization of Ras, and in turn, aid {{in the treatment of}} Ras driven cancers. Currently, the hydrophobic substrate binding site of Icmt is unknown. In order to characterize the substrate binding site of Icmt, site-directed mutagenesis was used to design mutations in the yeast homolog of Icmt, Ste 14 p, and these mutants were tested on substrate specificity. Residues L 33, L 34, L 40, L 176, L 190, and L 195 were mutated to alanine and residue F 80 was mutated to tyrosine. When tested with a methyltransferase assay, all of the mutants lost activity as compared to wild type (WT). Noticeably, L 190 A had only 44 % WT activity. This suggests that L 190 A is important for either substrate binding or the overall structural integrity of Ste 14 p. The results from trypsin digestion show that all mutants have cleavage patterns similar to WT. This indicates that the structural integrity of Ste 14 p remains intact regardless of these mutations. Substrate specificity and photolabeling experiments should be conducted in the future to elucidate if these residues are vital for the substrate binding site of Icmt.

DM is characterized by an overproduction of insulin to the point of insulin resistance in the body. The protein deposits in the AD-affected brain is related to the aggregation of tau protein and amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. Amyloid fibrils and their oligomeric precursors are known to be cytotoxic inducing neurological cell death. Recent clinical studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer’s disease and DM {{based on the fact that}} DM patients have double the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

In isolated hepatocytes, the branched N- 2 -heptyl derivatives were stronger inhibitors of GSH conjugation of bromosulphophthalein than the N-hexyl derivatives. The ethyl ester compounds were more efficient than the corresponding unesterified derivatives. The dodecyl ester of the N- 2 -heptyl analogue was the most effective inhibitor in isolated hepatocytes, but was relatively toxic in vivo. However, the corresponding ethyl ester was a potent in vivo inhibitor: GSH conjugation of bromosulphophthalein (as assessed by biliary excretion of the conjugate) was decreased by 70 % after administration of a dose of 200 mumol/kg. The isoenzyme specificity of the inhibitors towards purified rat and human glutathione S-transferases was also examined.

PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 induced an arrest of HL- 60 cells in G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle, but the effects of Akt inhibitor on cell cycle progression have not been investigated. The present study was undertaken in order to compare the effects of LY 294002 and SH- 5 on cell cycle progression in a model of aphidicolin and nocodazole-synchronized HL- 60 cells. Materials and Methods: HL- 60 cells were arrested at G 1 /S phase by aphidicolin, or G 2 /M phase by nocodazole, washed and allowed to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 (10 μM) and Akt inhibitor SH- 5 (20 μM) were added to medium after release from the block. DNA content was determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry.

No statistically significant effects were observed in LY 294002 or SH- 5 -treated cells at 1 – 5 h after release from nocodazole block. Conclusion: PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 and Akt inhibitor SH- 5, applied at doses <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> Akt-activity, have different effects on cell cycle progression in aphidicolin-synchronized HL- 60 cells, suggesting that LY 294002 -induced delay in S and G 2 /M phase is probably not due to the specific inhibition of Akt-activity...|$|E
40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana {{is used as}} a {{model system}} to study {{triacylglycerol}} (TAG) accumulation and seed germination in oilseeds. Here, we consider the partitioning of these lipid reserves between embryo and endosperm tissues in the mature seed. The Arabidopsis endosperm accumulates significant quantities of storage lipid, and this is effectively catabolized upon germination. This lipid differs in composition from that in the embryo and has a specific function during germination. Removing the endosperm from the wild-type seeds resulted in a reduction in hypocotyl elongation in the dark, demonstrating a role for endospermic TAG reserves in fueling skotomorphogenesis. Seedlings of two allelic gluconeogenically compromised phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (pck 1) mutants show a reduction in hypocotyl length in the dark compared with the wild type, but this is not further reduced by removing the endosperm. The short hypocotyl phenotypes were completely reversed by the provision of an exogenous supply of sucrose. The PCK 1 gene is expressed in both embryo and endosperm, and the induction of PCK 1 :b-glucuronidase at radicle emergence occurs in a robust, wave-like manner around the embryo suggestive of the action of a diffusing signal. Strikingly, the induction of PCK 1 promoter reporter constructs and measurements of lipid breakdown demonstrate that whereas lipid mobilization in the embryo is inhibited by abscisic acid (ABA), no effect is seen in the endosperm. This insensitivity of endosperm tissues is not specific to lipid breakdown because hydrolysis of the seed coat cell walls also proceeded in the presence of concentrations of ABA <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibit</b> radicle emergence. Both processes still required gibberellins, however. These results suggest a model whereby the breakdown of seed carbon reserves is regulated in a tissue-specific manner and shed new light on phytohormonal regulation of the germination process...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the use {{of natural}} {{antimicrobials}} such as plants extracts to preserve food get much attention of the researchers. This {{is related to the}} increasing of public concern over synthetic chemical food preservatives. Various types of plants had been declared can produce extracts <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibited</b> the growth of food-contaminating microbes, such as methanol and ethanol extracts of bark Saccoglottis gabonensis, <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibited</b> the growth of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus plantarum; extracts of onion and red pepper inhibited Candida crucei and Candida utilis; ethanol and water extracts of Eugenia Jambos had antimicrobial properties against bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Yersenia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus warneri; Picung seed extract (Pagium edule) inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus; and ethanol extract of Salvia pratensis leaves inhibited Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Extraction of antimicrobial compounds from plant material could be done by using different types of solvents. Among the various types of solvents, ethanol and methanol solvents are most commonly used. Keyword: antimicrobial, plant extract, food preservative </p...|$|R
40|$|PDGF-BB/PDGFR-ββ {{signaling}} plays very crucial {{roles in}} the process of many diseases such as liver fibrosis. However, drug candidates with selective affinities for PDGF-B/PDGFR-β remain deficient. Here, we identified a natural cyclopeptide termed destruxin A 5 <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibits</b> PDGF-BB-induced PDGFR-β signaling. Interestingly and importantly, the inhibitory mechanism is distinct from the mechanism of tyrosine kinase inhibitors because destruxin A 5 does not have the ability to bind to the ATP-binding pocket of PDGFR-β. Using Biacore T 200 technology, thermal shift technology, microscale thermophoresis technology and computational analysis, we confirmed that destruxin A 5 selectively targets the PDGF-B/PDGFR-β interaction interface to block this signaling. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of destruxin A 5 on PDGF-BB/PDGFR-ββ signaling was verified using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models, in which the extent of liver fibrosis was effectively alleviated by destruxin A 5. In summary, destruxin A 5 may represent an efficacious and more selective inhibitor of PDGF-BB/PDGFR-ββ signaling...|$|R
40|$|Paclobutrazol (Pbz) is a triazol <b>that</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibits</b> {{vegetative}} {{growth in}} peach. Changes in mineral element concentration have been generally found. However, uneven {{distribution of the}} elements in the soil may partially account for these differences. The trees were treated with 2 g Pbz/tree shortly AFB. Reductions of 40 % in leaf area and of 29 % in dry weight were recorded in Pbz-treated peach. Nutrient concentration on dry weight basis varied little (about 11 %). However, global assimilation of nutrients on a leaf basis, when compared with controls, decreased up to the same extend as dry weight (25 %). From these results it can be inferred that the mineral fertilization in Pbz-treated peach trees {{can be reduced to}} the same extend as the expected reduction in vegetative growth, consequently reducing production costs and environmental contamination.
