5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen).

Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E
