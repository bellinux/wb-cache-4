50|$|In 1836, Johann Kasper Einbigler {{designed}} a drum {{that not only}} was easier to tune than previous models, but also provided a far superior tone quality. He was able to improve the tone quality by suspending <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> with struts that were attached to the top of <b>the</b> <b>kettle.</b> This differed from previous models on which the rods were actually attached the side of <b>the</b> <b>kettle.</b> <b>The</b> struts on Einbigler's drum were directly connected to the support system under the drum and this allowed for <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> to resonate more freely.|$|R

50|$|In modern designs, {{once the}} water has reached boiling point, <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> {{automatically}} deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element. A bimetallic strip thermostat is commonly used as the automatic shut-off mechanism. The thermostat is isolated from the water in <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> and is instead heated by the steam created when the water boils, which is directed through a duct onto the bimetallic strip. This allows the thermostat to be coarsely calibrated, which in turn allows <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> to function normally at {{a wide range of}} altitudes. A consequence of this design is that <b>the</b> <b>kettle</b> may fail to deactivate if the lid is left open, due to an insufficient amount of steam being ducted onto the bimetallic strip.|$|R
