Objective. To identify and understand differences in <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> and musculoskeletal control strategies between men and women performing lifts of varying task complexity. Summary of Background Data. Few studies have examined differences in <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> as a function of individual factors such as subject gender. Furthermore, no biomechanical studies have attempted to quantify and understand how differences in anthropometry between genders might influence muscle recruitment and subsequent <b>spine</b> <b>loads.</b> Because the modern workplace seldom discriminates between genders in job assignments, {{it is important to understand}} how differences in <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> and potential low back disorder risk might be associated with gender differences. Methods. For this study, 140 subjects participated in two separate experiments requiring different degrees of musculoskeletal motion control during sagittal plane lifting. The two experiments consisted of 35 men and 35 women performing lifts in which motion was isolated to the torso and 35 men and 35 women completing whole-body free-dynamic whole body lifts. An electromyography-assisted model was used to evaluate <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> under these conditions. Results. Absolute spine compression generally was greater for the men. Under the highly controlled (isolated torso) conditions, most differences were attributed solely to differences in body mass. Under a whole-body free-dynamic condition, significant differences in muscle coactivations resulted in greater relative compression and anterior–posterior shear <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> for the women. Conclusions. Differences in spine loadings as a function of gender under the more controlled lifting conditions were primarily a function of different body masses. However, loading pattern differences existed between the genders under whole-body free-dynamic conditions as a result of kinematic compensations and increases in muscle cocontraction, with women generally experiencing greater relative <b>loads.</b> When <b>spine</b> tolerance differences are considered, one would expect that females would be at greater risk of musculoskeletal overload during lifting tasks...|$|R

Three levels of box weight were investigated (6. 8, 13. 6 and 22. 7 kg). Results: Men had significantly greater compression forces than women (about 640 N). Loading differences between genders were further magnified by several of the workplace factors.

40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} sources of {{variability}} associated with an EMG-assisted model of <b>spine</b> <b>loading.</b> Design. In vivo measurements of trunk dynamics, lifting moments and muscle activities were used as inputs into an EMG-assisted <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> model. Background. Several types of variability are inherent in biomechanical assessments of risk associated with trunk bending motions during lifting. Variability may occur {{as a function of}} variations in <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> due to either subject variations in motion profiles (kinematics) or biomechanical model performance. Methods. Twelve experienced and inexperienced materials handlers performed 10 repeated lifts where load weight, asymmetry, and velocity were varied. The experiment was replicated on a second day to assess day to day variability. Results. These model performance variables indicated that variability was mainly a function of subject characteristics and ex-perience. Minor variations in variability were associated with the task asymmetry and weight lifted. Advanced analyses suggested that experienced workers had a greater range of back motion compared to inexperienced workers which would aect the length– strength component of the model calibration. Conclusions. This study indicates that for the results of an EMG-assisted model to be accurate, it is important to ensure that the model reflects a realistic relationship between the trunk muscle length and the muscle force production capacity. Underestimation if this relationship can degrade model fidelity and robustness. Relevance These results imply that by properly calibrating the model it is then reasonable to assume {{that the vast majority of}} variations observed in repeated exertions of a particular trial are due to kinematic and kinetic dierences inherent in the muscle control system and not a function of model randomness.

Design. This study quantified trunk muscle cross-sectional areas of male and female <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> muscles. Background. There is a lack of comprehensive data regarding the female <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> muscle size. Although biomechanical models often assume females are the same as males, little is known regarding gender dierences in terms of trunk muscle areas and no data exist regarding the prediction of trunk muscle physiological cross-sectional areas from commonly used external anthro-pometric measures. Methods. Magnetic resonance imaging scans through the vertebral bodies from T 8 through S 1 were performed on 20 females and 10 males. Muscle fiber angle corrected cross-sectional areas were recorded at each vertebral level. Linear regression techniques taking into account anthropometric measures were utilized to develop prediction equations for the physiological cross-sectional area for each muscle of interest, as well as tests for dierences in cross-sectional areas due to gender and side of the body.

Specific occupational activities associated with low back pain include poor posture, whole body vibration, and repetitive lifting.

Trunk flexion can result in viscoelastic deformations of soft tissues and subsequent mechanical and neuromuscular alterations of the trunk, and may thereby increase LBD risk.

40|$|The {{low back}} loading {{to which an}} {{individual}} is exposed {{has been linked to}} injury and the reporting of low back pain. Despite extensive research on the <b>spine</b> and workplace <b>loading</b> exposures, statistics indicate that efforts to date have not led to large reductions in the reporting of these injuries. One possible cause for the apparent ineffectiveness of interventions may be a poorly defined understanding of the mechanical exposures of the spine during work related activities. There are sophisticated models that can predict <b>spine</b> <b>loads</b> and are responsive to how an individual moves and uses their muscles, however the models are complex and require extensive data collection to be implemented. This fact has prevented these models from being employed in industrial settings and the simplified surrogate methods that are being employed may not be predicting load exposures well. Therefore, this work focused on examining surrogate methods that can produce estimates of <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> equal to our most complex laboratory based models. In addition, our understanding of spine tolerance to combined motion and load has been based upon in-vitro work that has not accurately represented coupled physiologic compression and flexion or has not investigated potentially beneficial loading scenarios. The result has been a lack of clear data indicating when motion should be treated as the primary influence in injury development or when load is the likely injury causing exposure. As a result, research was conducted to determine the interplay between load and motion in cumulative injury development, as well as investigating the potential of static rest periods in mitigating the effects of cumulative compression. 	Study one examined the potential utility of artificial neural networks as a data reduction approach in obtaining estimates of time-varying loads and moments equal in magnitude to those of EMG-assisted and rigid link models. It was found that the neural network approach under predicted peak force and moment exposures, but produced strong predictions of average and cumulative exposures. Therefore this method may be a viable approach to document cumulative loads in industrial settings. 	Study two compared the load and moment estimates from a currently employed, posture match based ergonomic assessment tool (3 DMatch) to those obtained with an EMG-assisted model and those predicted with a rigid link modeling approach. The results indicated that 3 DMatch over predicted peak moments and cumulative compression. However, simple correction approaches were developed which can adjust the predictions to obtain more physiologic estimates. 	Study three employed flexion/extension motion with repetitive compression loading profiles in an in-vitro study, with both load and motion profiles being obtained from measures in study 1. It was found that at loads above 30 % of a spine’s compressive tolerance, repetitive flexion/extension would not lead to intervertebral disc injury prior to an endplate or vertebral fracture occurring. However, as loads fall below 30 % the likelihood of experiencing a herniation increases, while the overall likelihood of an injury occurring decreases. Comparison to relevant studies indicated that while repetitive flexion did not alter the site of injury it appeared to degrade the ability of the spine to tolerate compression. 	Finally, study four employed dynamic compression while the spine was maintained in a neutral posture to investigate the effects of ‘rest’, or periods of static low level loading, on altering the amount of load tolerated prior to injury. It was found that there was a non-linear relationship between load magnitude and compressive tolerance, with increasing load magnitude exposures leading to decreasing cumulative load tolerances. Periods of low level static loading did not alter the resistance of the spinal unit to cumulative compression or impact the number of cycles tolerated to failure. 	In summary, this work has examined methods that may allow for better predictions of <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> in the workplace without the large data demands of sophisticated laboratory approaches. Where possible, suggestions for optimal implementation of these surrogates have been developed. Additionally, in-vitro work has indicated a load threshold of 30 %, above which herniation is not likely to occur during dynamic repetitive loading. Furthermore, the insertion of static rest periods into dynamic loading scenarios did not improve the spine’s failure tolerance to loading, indicating that care should be exercised when determining optimal loading paradigms. In combination, the applied methods that have been developed and the information regarding injury development that has been obtained will help to refine our understanding of the exposures and tolerances that define mechanical injury in the spine...|$|R

The sports biomechanics literature has documented changes in trunk and lower extremity kinematics and muscle coactivation patterns as a function of stance width during high force dead lift and squat exercises. The focus of the current study was to explore whether these lifting stance width effects might translate into the occupational setting under more moderate load level conditions. Twelve subjects performed repetitions of a sagittally symmetric lifting and lowering task (10 kg load) under three stance width conditions: narrow (feet together), moderate (feet shoulder width) and wide (feet 150 % of shoulder width). As they performed these exertions, trunk kinematics were captured using the lumbar motion monitor while the activity of the trunk muscles (erector spinae, rectus abdominis) and lower extremity muscles (gluteus maximus, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis) were evaluated using normalized electromyography. The results showed that both the range of motion and peak acceleration in the sagittal plane were significantly affected by the stance width. The muscle activation levels, however, were not significantly affected by the stance width. These results collectively would indicate that the stance width effects seen in power lifting activities do not translate well into the occupational environment where more moderate loads are typically lifted...|$|R

An EMG-assisted trunk model, including IAP effects, was used to calculate spinal compression and shear forces and to reveal the contribution of back muscles, abdominal muscles, and IAP to moment generation. RESULTS. The belt reduced compression forces by about 10 %, but only when inhaling before lifting. The moment generated by IAP increased when wearing a belt and inhaling, but this moment was small and the increase was largely negated by the flexing moment generated by abdominal muscles. CONCLUSIONS. Wearing a tight and stiff back belt while inhaling before lifting reduces <b>spine</b> <b>loading.</b> This is caused by a moment generated by the belt rather than by the IAP. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
30|$|The growth zone and, to {{a lesser}} extent, the endplate, is the weakest part of the young porcine lumbar <b>spine</b> when <b>loaded</b> in flexion, {{extension}} or axially (Baranto et al. 2005 a; Baranto et al. 2005 b). Biomechanical studies investigating the effect of cyclical loading and then axial compression to failure of the porcine spine have disclosed that the endplate and the growth zone are the weakest part of the cyclically loaded functional spinal units (Thoreson et al. 2010). There are no previous biomechanical studies investigating the effect of cyclical loading on the porcine proximal femur.|$|R
40|$|Neck and {{low back}} pain causes highest {{disability}} rates in industrialized countries. Apart from blue-collar occupations dentists and dental care personnel are also strongly affected by work related back pain. However, due to missing analysing systems spine exposure could not be adequately estimated for sitting and non load bearing tasks. Therefore, a new biomechanical measurement system was developed to analyze spine and trunk kinematics. To explore the potential kinematics impact on the spine two days of periodontology care have been examined. Moreover, to asses the influence of an altered sitting position data was collected in 9 (day 1) and 12 (day 2) o’clock position. Data were collected and analyzed by the new 3 D-SpineMoveGuard. The systems analyze postures and movements of spine and trunk by ultrasound and inclinometer. Two days of routine non-surgical periodontal treatment were recorded by a frequency of 10 Hz. Moderate awkward postures could be assessed for 90 % of the treatment. Up to 85 % of the working days were spent in isometric position. Movements were rare and of small amplitude. There were no relevant differences between 9 and 12 o’clock position. The frequently reported back pain in dentists is not only related to severe body postures {{rather than to the}} high amount of isometric <b>spine</b> <b>loads.</b> Moreover, an altered sitting position did not reduce this physiological stress. Therefore, dentist specific interventions concepts should pay more attention to physical training during and off work. Ergonomic investments should be carefully evaluated before implemented...|$|R
40|$|Bolting large {{sheets of}} wire mesh screen (WMS) {{to the roof}} of {{underground}} mines prevents injuries due to rock falls. However, WMS can be heavy and awkward to lift and transport, and may result in significant spinal loading. Accordingly, six male subjects (mean age = 45. 8 years + 7. 5 SD) were recruited to lift WMS in a laboratory investigation of the biomechanical demands. Biomechanical modeling was used to estimate external moments about L 5 -S 1 for sixteen lifting tasks, using two sizes of WMS. Full-size WMS involved a two-person lift, while half-size WMS involved a one-person lift. Lifts were performed under 168 cm and 213 cm vertical space. Restriction in vertical space increased the maximum L 5 -S 1 extensor moment from 254 to 274 Nm and right lateral bending moment from 195 to 251 Nm. Lifting full sheets of screen (as opposed to half sheets) resulted in an average 33 Nm increase in L 5 -S 1 extensor moment. The L 5 -S 1 extensor moment was increased by an average of 44 Nm (18 %) when lifting screens positioned flat on the floor compared to an upright position. Relevance to industry: Large flexible materials are commonly lifted in industrial work environments, and may involve the efforts of two or more workers. The current study examines the low back loading associated with lifting large flexible screens and presents recommendations to reduce <b>spine</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
30|$|Observed {{variations}} in the lordosis and lumbosacral angle values confirm the already known physiological changes produced by the transition from supine to orthostatic position. From a biomechanical point of view, reduced intervertebral disc thickness is closely related: the disk is the fulcrum of a lever in which the resistance is represented by facet joints, and muscles are the power. These aspects emphasize the high sensitivity of the method in evaluating changes in physiopathological discs. These aspects confirms the high sensitivity in assessing the lumbar <b>spine</b> under <b>load</b> conditions, thereby putting some stress {{on the importance of}} upright MRI in all those cases where the supine MRI assessment is negative.|$|R
30|$|Until a {{few years}} ago, X-ray was the only {{practicable}} imaging modality for the spine in the upright position. This examination is valid and useful for evaluating spinal curvatures, but it shows its limitations when the assessment should be directed to disc structures or when {{it is necessary to}} obtain measurements free from problems due to overlapping of anatomical images. A first attempt to evaluate the <b>spine</b> under the <b>loading</b> condition was done with the axial load technique, which is to simulate physiological <b>loading</b> of the <b>spine</b> in the orthostatic position. Although results were certainly interesting, the technique has not achieved a general consensus. Studies with axial load, even if they allow better assessment in relation to the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) afforded by the high-field equipment, do not allow evaluation of the influence that physiological load—represented by the weight of the head and body and by muscle activation—has on the lumbar <b>spine,</b> simulating a <b>load</b> with caudate–cranial direction [6 – 8].|$|R
40|$|Objective. To study {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} aiflutop (A) in lumbar osteochondrosis (LO) with {{chronic back pain}} syndrome. Material and Methods. 32 pts with LO were included. 14 from them (group 1) during a year received 2 courses of A intramuscular injections (I ml/day, 30 ml total) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if necessary. 18 pts (group 2) received NSAIDs only. Clinical examination of pts was performed at the stert of the study, before and after each A course and in 3 months after the last course. Results. Pain in the spine at rest and forward bending significantly decreased in group 1 pts (p< 0, 05) after each A course. Full pain disappearance after the first A course was achieved in 7, 1 % and after the second course - in 35, 7 % of group I pts and was not shown in control group. Significant stepped decrease of Thomayer's test value (p< 0, 00 l) was also shown in group 1 : 3, 6 times decrease in comparison with baseline was achieved in 3 months after completion of treatment with A. During treatment period these pts showed 2 - 2, 5 times increase of static and dynamic <b>spine</b> <b>load</b> (according to Vxdel chronic inability index). 42, 9 % of group I pts stopped NSAIDs after A treatment completion. Only 5, 6 % of control group pts stopped NSAIDs during follow up. A tolerability was good. It can be combined with any other medications the pts received due to comorbid diseases...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{stiffness and}} load-displacement curves as a biomechanical response to applied torsion and shear forces in cadaveric canine lumbar and lumbosacral specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical study. ANIMALS: Caudal lumbar and lumbosacral functional spine units (FSU) of nonchondrodystrophic large-breed dogs (n= 31) with radiographically normal spines. METHODS: FSU from dogs without musculoskeletal disease {{were tested in}} torsion in a custom-built <b>spine</b> <b>loading</b> simulator with 6 degrees of freedom, which uses orthogonally mounted electric motors to apply pure axial rotation. For shear tests, specimens were mounted to a custom-made shear-testing device, driven by a servo hydraulic testing machine. Load-displacement curves were recorded for torsion and shear. RESULTS: Left and right torsion stiffness was not different within each FSU level; however, torsional stiffness of L 7 -S 1 was significantly smaller compared with lumbar FSU (L 4 - 5 -L 6 - 7). Ventral/dorsal stiffness was significantly different from lateral stiffness within an individual FSU level for L 5 - 6, L 6 - 7, and L 7 -S 1 but not for L 4 - 5. When the data from 4 tested shear directions from the same specimen were pooled, level L 5 - 6 was significantly stiffer than L 7 -S 1. CONCLUSIONS: Increased range of motion of the lumbosacral joint is reflected by an overall decreased shear and rotational stiffness at the lumbosacral FSU. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Data from dogs with disc degeneration have to be collected, analyzed, and compared with results from our chondrodystrophic large-breed dogs with radiographically normal spines...|$|R
