The next year Playtex Products acquired the Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen company for $83 million. Later that year Playtex Products {{was acquired by}} Energizer Holdings for $1.16 billion. Playtex Products was sued in 2008, when a mother accused the company of not adequately disclosing their baby bottles contained bisphenol A. After Canada considered banning the chemical, the company <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of their bottles the following year. In 2008, Playtex Products was acquired by Energizer Holdings.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the water and returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|Traffic was {{originally}} {{going to be}} distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in Traffic, Fox's interest in the film was renewed, and the studio <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio {{by the time the}} first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.|$|E

25|$|The first {{attempts}} to end {{slavery in the}} British/American colonies came from Thomas Jefferson {{and some of his}} contemporaries. Despite the fact that Jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, but other delegates <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Benjamin Franklin, also a slaveholder for much of his life, became a leading member of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States. Following the American Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of Vermont, followed by Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780. Other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it. Some slaves continued to live in servitude for two more decades but most were freed.|$|E
500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.

So I had to put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E

500|$|Two family {{incidents}} {{during this}} time later surfaced during Romney's political campaigns. [...] A state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number {{and that he would}} face a $50fine if he took the boat onto the lake. Disagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing, Romney <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> anyway, saying he would pay the fine. The ranger arrested him for disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped several days later. In 1983, on a twelve-hour family road trip, he placed the family's dog in a windshield-equipped carrier on the roof of their car, and then washed the car and carrier after the dog suffered a bout of diarrhea. [...] The dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney's critics and political opponents.|$|E
500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But I <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, {{for the end of the}} world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained." ...|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot.

500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing my legs ... We <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the water and started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We {{had never seen anything like}} that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms.

2500|$|From its inception, the Jesus Army aroused controversy. The {{original}} Bugbrooke Jesus Fellowship {{had long}} {{been a part of}} the Baptist Union. However, the sudden expansion in members made the new church a nationwide movement. This <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the ambit of the Baptist Union, which places authority within a specific congregation. The JA was also accused of [...] "isolationism", epitomised by the JA practice of sometimes rebaptising new members who had already been baptised by other Baptist churches, implying that Christian baptism elsewhere may have been invalid. Consequently, in 1986 the Jesus Army was expelled from the Baptist Union, leaving it on the margins of the Baptist denomination.|$|E
