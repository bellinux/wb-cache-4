5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to <b>televise.</b> In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found that preschoolers appear {{confused}} about some of the properties of <b>televised</b> images, indicating that the <b>televised</b> image shares some of the same properties of the object it is representing. For example, 3. 5 -year-olds claim that a <b>televised</b> object will spill if the television is turned upside down and 3. 5 - and 4. 5 -year-olds claim that a character appearing on television can see and hear them. Little is known, however, about the reasoning behind these confusions regarding <b>televised</b> images and whether children will act on these beliefs. In this project, two novel tasks were created. One of these tasks looked at whether children 2 ̆ 7 s behavioral responses about a <b>televised</b> person matched their verbal beliefs. Three-and-one-half- to 5. 5 -year-olds were introduced to a live person and a <b>televised</b> person who provided information about the location of a hidden sticker(Study 1 a and 1 b). All three age groups said that the <b>televised</b> individual could see the hiding event and acted on this claim by searching for the sticker in the location suggested by the <b>televised</b> individual about as often as the information suggested by the live individual. The second task examined the rationale behind childrens 2 ̆ 7 confusion about the properties of <b>televised</b> images by creating a task in which children made comparisons between an item presented in three different modalities (as a <b>televised</b> object, as a physical object, and as a photo of the object). When given this comparison task (study 2), 3. 5 - and 4. 5 - year-olds claimed that the <b>televised</b> objects no longer shared the properties of real objects (e. g., said that the <b>televised</b> object would not spill if the television was turned upside down). Having the <b>televised</b> object next to the real object or a photo of the object seemed to help direct children 2 ̆ 7 s {{attention to the fact that}} the question was being asked about the <b>televised</b> object itself and not the real object it was representing. Preschoolers may understand the properties of <b>televised</b> objects much earlier than previously believed; however, understanding the properties of <b>televised</b> people may be more difficult. ...|$|R
