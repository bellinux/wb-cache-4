40|$|AbstractThe present paper investigates {{about the}} {{production}} of biodiesel from neat Mahua oil via base catalyzed transesterification and mixing of the biodiesel with a suitable additive (Dimethyl carbonate) in varying volume proportions in order to prepare a number of <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> for engine application. The prepared <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> are used in single cylinder water cooled diesel engine at various load conditions to evaluate the performance and emission parameters of the engine. The results of investigation show increase in brake power and brake thermal efficiency with load for all prepared <b>test</b> <b>fuels.</b> It is also noticed that brake thermal efficiency increases with the percentage of additive in all the <b>test</b> <b>fuels.</b> The brake specific fuel consumption decreases with increase in additive percentage. Exhaust gas temperature increases almost linearly with load for all <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> and decreases with increase in additive percentage. It is also seen from the results that both CO and HC emissions tend to decrease with increase in additive percentage in biodiesel. The smoke and NOx emissions also decrease with increase in additive percentage in the biodiesel fuel. During {{the course of this}} experimental investigation {{it was found that the}} overall performance and emission characteristics of the engine was satisfactory with all the <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> and improved with repeated experiments. All the test results significantly improved with increase in the additive percentage in biodiesel. Therefore the present paper provides a strong platform to continue further investigation on using biodiesel fuel in a diesel engine with variety of fuel additives under varying engine operating parameters...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the experimental {{study on the}} performance of single cylinder diesel engine operating with tire derived fuel (TDF), TDF-diesel fuel blends and also plastic derived fuel (PDF). The objectives of this project is to determine the fuel properties of TDF, TDF-diesel fuel blends and PDF, evaluating the performance of TDF and PDF when used in diesel engine and also to investigate the effect when several blend ratios between TDF and diesel fuel are used. The performance testing is conducted using a single cylinder engine test rig operating with variable engine speed and constant load exerted to the engine. The diesel engine is equipped with hydraulic dynamometer and necessary sensors to collect and measure the desired data. The parameters that were measured during testing include engine torque, power, combustion pressure and exhaust emissions. The obtained data for all <b>tested</b> <b>fuels</b> are compared to diesel fuel performance data. Then, the properties of all <b>tested</b> <b>fuels</b> are also determined. Six samples of <b>tested</b> <b>fuels</b> are prepared where TDF is blended with diesel fuel at three different ratios which is 10 %, 30 % and 50 % together with 100 % unblended TDF, PDF and diesel fuel. The PDF that used is 100 % not blended with any other fuel. The comparison between TDF, TDF-diesel fuel blends and diesel fuel shows that TDF-diesel fuel blends produce higher power and torque compared to TDF and diesel <b>fuel.</b> Among <b>tested</b> blend ratio, TDF 10 % yield highest power and torque compared to other <b>tested</b> <b>fuel.</b> When the TDF blend ratio increases, the power and torque decreases. For cylinder pressure, TDF 50 % produce highest peak pressure compared to other <b>tested</b> <b>fuels.</b> When the TDF blend ratio decrease, the peak pressure will decrease. For emission, diesel fuel produce lowest COx and NOx emission level compared to other <b>tested</b> <b>fuels</b> while TDF 10 % produce closest emission level to diesel fuel. PDF produce lowest power, torque and peak pressure compared to TDF and diesel fuel. PDF also produce lowest NOx and CO emission level compared to TDF and diesel fuel. From the results that were obtained in the experiment, it is concluded that TDF and PDF can be used in diesel engine. However, TDF is not suitable for high speed application since it will cause backfires. Blending process between TDF and diesel fuel enhance the properties of TDF thus producing better performance. From the results obtained, TDF 10 % produced most optimum performance output compared to the other <b>test</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{ignition}} {{process is}} of importance in premixed diesel low-temperature combustion strategies because longer ignition delay could provide more fuel and air mixing time. Using blends {{of gasoline and}} diesel-like fuels might be a possible way for the ignition delay extension. In this study, a rapid compression machine is employed to investigate the characteristics of premixed ignition processes of blends of n-heptane and commercial gasoline. The proportion of gasoline in blended fuels and the compression ratio in this rapid compression machine are varied to investigate the effects of fuel component and compression ratio on ignition processes. It is found that blended <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> have two-stage increases in their cylinder pressure traces, indicating that a low temperature heat release process exists before the main combustion stage. Increased gasoline proportion in <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> reduces peak cylinder pressure and maximum pressure rise rates, while the 1 st, 2 nd and overall ignition delay are extended. Increased compression ratio elevates the peak cylinder pressure, and shortens the 1 st stage, 2 nd stage and overall ignition delays. The maximum pressure rising rates are also increased with compression ratio, so when the low gasoline proportion <b>test</b> <b>fuels</b> are used, knock combustion tends to occur at high compression ratio conditions. However, {{as long as the}} gasoline proportion increases to a sufficient level, knock combustion is avoided...|$|R

The reprocessing of irradiated thorium rods which {{was carried out}} during the period 1989 to 1992 in the concrete shielded cells, {{was the first major}} radioactive operation. The U-233 recovered during the operation was used in fabricating the fuel for the KAlpakkam MINI reactor (KAMINI). U-233 was also useful for the fuel development programme for carrying out the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor <b>test</b> <b>fuel</b> irradiation experiments in Fast Breeder Test Reactor. Apart from this, the operation aided in validating the equipment and design of system as well as the manpower training. Later a hot cell facility for reprocessing of Fast Breeder Test Reactor fuel was conceived which had the necessary features for delivering the product with all the uncertainties in the dissolution of irradiated fuel and process flowsheet. Added to this was the need for the deployment of the yet to be proven designs of centrifuge and centrifugal extractors without which the success of the PUREX process for fast reactor fuel reprocessing would be doubtful. With these minimal inputs, the hot cell facility, Lead Mini Cell (LMC) was created, which was later rechristened as CORAL (COmpact Reprocessing facility for Advanced fuels in Lead cells).

50|$|Buffer tanks {{store the}} hot water the biomass {{appliance}} generates and circulates it around the heating system. Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume {{of water in the}} complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as Carbon monoxide, dust, and NOx, greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or <b>test</b> <b>fuel.</b> A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output - in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The residual heat from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. light weight, fast response boilers require only 10ltr/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40ltr/kW.|$|E
