5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point; he felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how quickly he had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, {{a loss of}} a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took {{suicide and}} explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to {{a low level of}} social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E
25|$|Straight {{from his}} University years, Max {{was chosen to}} travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil {{in the summer of}} 1913.

In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was {{cancelled}} when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E
25|$|Coen had an {{indifferent}} {{season in}} 1925–26, but in 1926–27 he suddenly {{emerged as one}} of the top cricketers in South Africa, with 737 runs in the season at an average of 73.70 and, having previously not taken a single wicket, 14 wickets as well. The runs and wickets came not just against the weaker sides: in the match against Transvaal, he took four wickets for 92 runs in Transvaal's first innings and then, when Orange Free State had been set an unlikely 559 to win, he made 172 in the second innings, so the game was lost by only 111 runs. The following match, against Natal he was promoted to open the innings and made 165, putting on 305 for the second wicket with Mick Commaille; this was then somewhat overshadowed by a first-wicket partnership of 424 for Natal, but it remains the highest second-wicket partnership in first-class cricket for Orange Free State. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> come in the next match. Coen made 87 in the first innings of the game against Eastern Province and then, again in partnership with Commaille, he hit 132 out of an unbroken first-wicket stand of 236 which also remains as an Orange Free State/Free State record and which won the match.|$|E

25|$|Regardless {{of these}} closures, {{a steady stream}} of bands were {{beginning}} to develop considerable profiles. Alchemist, who had formed in Canberra in 1987, had finally refined its unique style that comprised elements of death metal, grindcore, surf rock and psychedelia. A track from their second album Lunasphere had been included on one of the 3 Hours of Power compilations and the group played at the 1996 Sydney Big Day Out. In Sydney, the symphonic black metal band Lord Kaos were filling the gap that had been left by the dissolution of Bestial Warlust, and a core group of bands like Mortality, Cryogenic and Segression were proving that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the local scene than just death metal. Death metal was the focus of Brisbane's scene, however, headed by Misery who had formed in 1992 and featuring others like Sakkuth and Killengod. A developing melodic metal/power metal scene led by Hyperion but also including groups like Apparition, Pegazus, Vanishing Point and Eyefear were starting to appear in the always diverse Melbourne. In Perth, isolation was a serious problem. Both Allegiance and iNFeCTeD, a death metal band that had released two albums on Shock, had self-destructed not long after returning from expensive east coast tours.|$|E

According to Mike Reiss, [...] "Something about her did not animate correctly. The voice did not work for our purposes." [...] Jo Ann Harris, a regular voice actor in the show, had recorded a temporary track using an impression of Shelley Long's character Diane Chambers from Cheers. The producers thought it fit the role better and used it instead of O'Hara, although O'Hara is still credited {{at the end of the}} episode. Sam Simon had previously written for Cheers, and contributed much of Collette's dialogue, as he was familiar with writing dialogue for Diane.
