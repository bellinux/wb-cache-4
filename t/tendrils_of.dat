25|$|Nepenthes bicalcarata {{provides}} {{space in}} the hollow <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> its upper pitchers for the carpenter ant Camponotus schmitzi to build nests. The ants take larger prey from the pitchers, which may benefit N.bicalcarata by {{reducing the amount of}} putrefaction of collected organic matter that could harm the natural community of infaunal species that aid the plant's digestion.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialised}} pitcher traps of Nepenthes plants {{form on the}} end of tendrils. The <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> aerial pitchers {{are usually}} coiled in the middle. If the tendril comes into contact with an object for long enough it will usually curl around it, forming a strong anchor point for the pitcher. In this way, the tendrils help to support the growing stem of the plant.|$|E

25|$|The most typical form {{which the}} Jesse Tree takes {{is to show}} the figure of Jesse, often larger than all the rest, {{reclining}} or sleeping (perhaps by analogy to Adam when his rib was taken) {{at the foot of}} the pictorial space. From his side or his navel springs the trunk of a tree or vine which ascends, branching to either side. On the branches, usually surrounded by formally scrolling <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> foliage, are figures representing the ancestors of Christ. The trunk generally ascends vertically to Mary and then Christ at the top.|$|E
25|$|Confrontation of pro-Dionysiac and pro-Indian divinities in the Olympus: Athena defeats Ares, Hera defeats Artemis, Apollo confronts Poseidon, but Hermes pacifies them. On earth, Deriades harangues {{his troops}} and charges with his elephants. After {{a series of}} combats and {{descriptions}} of carnage, Deriades fights one-on-one with Dionysus: Dionysus eludes him adopting different shapes, imprisons him with the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> a vine and finally releases him. Dionysus orders the Rhadamanes to build a fleet for him. Deriades presides the Indian assembly, in which he harangues his troops for the sea-battle. The two armies sign a truce to bury the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{inside of}} the ribbon was {{conceptualized}} as similar to a dense electrical storm, with <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> electricity fogging the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and Enterprise-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E

25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E
500|$|To {{induce the}} {{splitting}} of the costume, the series' special effect coordinator Darrell Pritchett inserted squibs {{inside of the}} suit. Nicotero stated: [...] "On 'action', my makeup effects crew pulled the upper body apart, and the physical effects crew squibbed all the bags. Then visual effects guys went in and added those few little <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> stretching, ripping intestines." [...] Because rubber constituted {{a large percentage of}} the suit, weights were added on to ensure that it would sink in the water. While recording commenced, approximately 12–15 gallons of liquid were poured into the well following the dropping of the prosthetic legs. Four takes were produced of that sequence.|$|E

[...] He defeated Republican opponent Helen Delich Bentley, who had represented the 2nd district from 1985 to 1995, with 55 percent of the vote. He has never faced another close contest since then and has been reelected five times.|$|E
60|$|Sachs {{attributes}} all {{the movements}} <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> to rapid growth {{on the side}} opposite to that which becomes concave. These movements consist of revolving nutation, the bending {{to and from the}} light, and in opposition to gravity, those caused by a touch, and spiral contraction. It is rash to differ from so great an authority, but I cannot believe that one at least of these movements--curvature from a touch--is thus caused. {38} In the first place it may be remarked that the movement of nutation differs from that due to a touch, in so far that in some cases the two powers are acquired by the same tendril at different periods of growth; and the sensitive part <b>of</b> the <b>tendril</b> does not seem capable of nutation. One of my chief reasons for doubting whether the curvature from a touch is the result of growth, is the extraordinary rapidity of the movement. I have seen the extremity <b>of</b> a <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Passiflora gracilis, after being touched, distinctly bent in 25 seconds, and often in 30 seconds; and so it is with the thicker <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Sicyos. It appears hardly credible that their outer surfaces could have actually grown in length, which implies a permanent modification of structure, in so short a time. The growth, moreover, on this view must be considerable, for if the touch has been at all rough the extremity is coiled in two or three minutes into a spire of several turns.|$|R
60|$|The first action <b>of</b> a <b>tendril</b> is {{to place}} itself in a proper position. For instance, the <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> Cobaea first rises {{vertically}} up, with its branches divergent and with the terminal hooks turned outwards; the young shoot at the extremity of the stem {{is at the same}} time bent to one side, so as to be out of the way. The young leaves of Clematis, on the other hand, prepare for action by temporarily curving themselves downwards, so as to serve as grapnels.|$|R

2500|$|Wells Cathedral has a rare {{example of}} an intact 14th-century Jesse Tree window which survived the iconoclasm of the 17th-century and the losses of World War II. The window is located {{high up in the}} eastern end of the choir. The colours of this window are red, yellow, green, white and brown, with very little blue. The window is wide for its height, having seven lights, and being topped by tracery. Consequently, the <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> the Tree spread out {{sideways}} and the central panel has only three figures: the reclining Jesse at the bottom; the Blessed Virgin holding the Christ Child in her arms and above, the crucified Christ. There are fourteen more figures in the window, identifiable in some cases by their attributes, such as David's harp and Solomon's model of the Temple of Jerusalem. As well as the tendrils, the figures are framed by typical 14th-century canopies and bases displaying the name of each person. [...] The window is currently undergoing extensive conservation.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Mellen, {{author of}} The Group of Seven (1970), {{wrote of the}} work's [...] "perfect serenity. It is evening– the sky and lake are {{perfectly}} calm and are painted in broad, flat horizontal strokes. Even the soft mauves, pinks, and greens contribute to this effect. Countering the strong horizontals are the drooping red <b>tendrils</b> <b>of</b> the bare pine branches, the vertical lines of the trees, and the curves of the hills... achieves pure poetry in painting, by combining an intuitive feeling for nature with an almost classical control of technique." [...] A year later, Jean Boggs proposed that Thomson {{was influenced by the}} European Symbolists: [...] "against the dying light and sky the scraggly forms of The Jack Pine are most dramatic, its branches struggling to life but dominated by dark-green, tattered, bat-like forms as if the tree were a symbol– beautiful, oriental, but a symbol nevertheless of Thomson's wish for his own death on this spot." [...] Others considered the painting evidence that Thomson was, or might have become, an increasingly abstract or Expressionist artist.|$|E

It is cleaned piece by piece by a technician on a raised platform. The technician moves slowly around the chandelier cleaning each individual spike and <b>tendril</b> <b>of</b> glass with an antistatic wand made of plastic filaments. This has {{to be carried out}} before the museum opens, a process that takes several days.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at Khulis, Khulis Governorate, Makkah region, {{on the first of}} April during the growing season of 2007, to study the {{morphology}} and anatomy <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> in different eight of cucurbit genera. The results showed a great variation among the most tested cucurbit genera concerning the twisting, branching, number <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> per node and presence <b>of</b> <b>tendril</b> trunk. Also, shape of transverse sections were ovate, sinuate-rhombic, sinuate-emarginate oblong, emarginate-ovate, spherical, notched-ovate and reniform. Furthermore, presence of collenchymatous, sclerenchymatous tissues, number of vascular bundles in Transverse Section (TV) and arrangement of vascular bundles varied according to the studied species. It could be conclude from this research that there are a numerous of qualitative traits <b>of</b> <b>tendrils</b> which {{plays an important role in}} identification of cucrbitaceous plants for examples; the twisting, branching, transverse section shape, collenchymatous tissue, scleranchymatous tissue, tylosis and arrangement of vascular bundles...|$|R
