50|$|CoCrFeMnNi {{has been}} found to have {{exceptional}} low-temperature mechanical properties and high fracture toughness, with both ductility and yield strength increasing as <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>temperature</b> was reduced from room temperature to 77 K. This was attributed to the onset of nanoscale twin boundary formation, an additional deformation mechanism that was not in effect at higher temperatures. As such, it may have applications as a structural material in low-temperature applications or, because of its high toughness, as an energy-absorbing material. However, later research showed that lower-entropy alloys with fewer elements or non-equiatomic compositions may have higher strength or higher toughness. No ductile to brittle transition was observed in the bcc AlCoCrFeNi alloy in tests as low as 77 K.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid metal {{embrittlement}} or LME {{is characterized by}} the reduction in the threshold stress intensity, true fracture stress or in the strain to fracture when tested in the presence of liquid metals as compared to that obtained in air / vacuum tests.

A ductile-to-brittle transition behaviour is also exhibited by many metal couples. The shape of the elastic region of the stress-strain curve is not altered, but the plastic region may be changed during LME. Very high crack propagation rates, varying from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second are induced in solid metals by the embrittling liquid metals.

The {{results show that}} with the decrease of pouring temperature, the primary dendrite arm spacing increases, and the segregation ratio of main elements decreases obviously. DD 6 alloy has the similar tensile behavior under {{the conditions of the}} pouring temperatures of 1520 ℃ and 1570 ℃.

The yield and ultimate tensile strengths of the specimens with the pouring temperature of 1520 ℃ is little lower than the specimens with the pouring temperature of 1570 ℃ under <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>temperatures</b> at room temperature and 650 ℃, while the specimens with the pouring temperature 1520 ℃ have higher yield and ultimate tensile strength when <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> <b>temperature</b> is higher than 760 ℃.
