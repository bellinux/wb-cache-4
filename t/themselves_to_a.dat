5|$|Seeking {{to explore}} more {{alternative}} realities, Stewie takes Brian to a universe resembling the 1960 animated sitcom The Flintstones. Peter {{and his wife}} Lois are shown dressed {{in a manner similar}} to Fred Flintstone and Wilma Flintstone respectively. Becoming tired of this universe, the two then transport <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> universe where the atomic bombing of Japan never occurred, allowing Japan to conquer the United States in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Another {{universe}} references many {{works by}} Walt Disney. Meg appears as Ursula from the 1989 film The Little Mermaid and Herbert appears as the Queen from the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Walt Disney's alleged antisemitism is also referenced {{by having the}} universe's occupants attack the Disney version of Mort Goldman when he enters a room, brutally beating him to death off-screen. Discouraged, Brian and Stewie transport <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> universe resembling the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken, a show executive-produced by Family Guy cast member Seth Green. The sequence reveals several action figures of cartoon characters: He-Man, Optimus Prime, Lion-O and Duke from G.I. Joe.|$|E

5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw {{has left}} a varied musical legacy, {{not all of it}} of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and the Man was the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E
5|$|Let us {{bring up}} women, not {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Hamud was {{loyal to}} the British and acted as a figurehead for an {{essentially}} British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a crown colony. Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms. The emancipation of slaves required them to present <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> government office and proved a slow process—within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two major}} land battles of the invasion, the Allies clearly {{adjusted}} their tactics to nullify the Persian advantage in numbers and cavalry, by occupying the pass at Thermopylae, and by staying on high ground at Plataea. At Thermopylae, until the path outflanking the Allied position was revealed, the Persians signally failed to adjust their tactics to the situation, although the position was well chosen to limit the Persian options. At Plataea, the harassing of the Allied positions by cavalry was a successful tactic, forcing the precipitous (and nearly disastrous) retreat; however, Mardonius then brought about a general melee between the infantry, {{which resulted in the}} Persian defeat. The events at Mycale reveal a similar story; Persian infantry committing <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> melee with hoplites, with disastrous results. It has been suggested that there is little evidence of complex tactics in the Greco-Persian wars. However, as simple as the Greek tactics were, they played to their strengths; the Persians however, may have seriously underestimated the strength of the hoplite, and their failure to adapt to facing the Allied infantry contributed to the eventual Persian defeat.|$|E

5|$|Individual {{sketches}} and songs were {{cast by the}} production team, sometimes acting on input from the show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular actor, Norris said that confidence in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type. The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another. Recurring characters were {{if at all possible}} played by the actor who had originated the part, leading to the development of several signature roles, as for example Baynton's Charles II, Jim Howick's Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's Henry VIII, Martha Howe-Douglas' Elizabeth I and Simon Farnaby's Death.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher incidence of infection.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Muslim conquests, the Byzantine Empire, as the largest, richest and militarily strongest state bordering the expanding Caliphate, had been the Muslims' primary enemy. Following the disastrous Battle of Sebastopolis, the Byzantines had largely confined <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strategy of passive defence, while the Muslim armies regularly launched raids into Byzantine-held Anatolia. Following their failure to capture the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the Umayyads for a time diverted their attention elsewhere. From 720/721, however, they resumed these expeditions in a regular pattern: each summer one or two campaigns (pl. ṣawā'if, sing. ṣā'ifa) would be launched, sometimes accompanied by a naval attack and sometimes followed by winter expeditions (shawātī). These were no longer aimed at permanent conquest but rather large-scale raids, plundering and devastating the countryside and only occasionally attacking forts or major settlements. The raids of this period were also largely confined to the central Anatolian plateau (chiefly its eastern half, Cappadocia), and only rarely reached the peripheral coastlands.|$|E
