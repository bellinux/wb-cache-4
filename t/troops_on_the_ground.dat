5|$|The GUNT-Libyan {{alliance}} invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habré had entrenched {{himself with}} about 5,000 troops. Battered by {{multiple rocket launcher}} (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Habré escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result}} of the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
50|$|One {{regiment}} of Essex's {{right wing}} {{had been the}} target of Wilmot's charge. The other two had been at the moment, invisible, and every Royalist <b>troop</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> including <b>the</b> King's guards, joined in the mad ride to Kineton. This regiment, Essex's life-guard, and some troops that had rallied from the effect of Rupert's charge (amongst them, Captain Oliver Cromwell's), were the only cavalry still present. They now joined with decisive effect in <b>the</b> attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left of the royal infantry.|$|R

25|$|Lester B. Pearson, {{who would}} later become the Prime Minister of Canada, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957 for his efforts in {{creating}} a mandate for a United Nations Peacekeeping Force, and he is considered {{the father of the}} modern concept of peacekeeping. The Suez Crisis contributed to the adoption of a new national flag of Canada in 1965, as the Egyptian government had objected to Canadian peacekeeping <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> that their flag at that time included a British ensign. As Prime Minister, Pearson would advocate the simple Maple Leaf that was eventually adopted.|$|R

500|$|Hathaway's {{eldest son}} Francis {{and his wife}} Mary were killed during the Liverpool Blitz; his son Michael became first in line to inherit the island. Her husband was {{deported}} to Ilag VII in Laufen in Bavaria in February 1943, where he remained {{for the rest of}} the war. He did not sign any document delegating his seigneurial authority, which meant that legality of ordinances issued by Hathaway during this period was, at best, questionable. She refused to sign orders issued by Germans, arguing that they were simply not hers to sign. She was insulted by an order that prohibited sexual relations between her tenants and German <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of venereal disease outbreak, since the order implied that Sarkese women consorted with Germans.|$|R
60|$|To make {{assurance}} doubly sure, Pompey gave {{orders that}} his troops should not advance {{to meet the}} onset of Caesar's <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>ground</b> between <b>the</b> two armies, but that they should wait calmly for the attack, and receive the enemy at the posts where they had themselves been arrayed.|$|R
50|$|The Bay of Pigs Invasion {{began on}} April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, called Brigade 2506, landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. No U.S. air support was provided.

25|$|Political {{violence}} {{broke out}} in Northern Ireland in 1968 following clashes over a civil rights campaign. The civil rights campaign demanding an end to institutionalised discrimination against nationalists by the unionist Government of Northern Ireland.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the day, the YPA {{still held}} many of its {{positions}} but was rapidly losing ground.

50|$|While at Batticaloa, Suffren {{received}} dispatches {{from the}} Île de France (now Mauritius) that {{ordered him to}} return there to escort additional French troops to India.

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Israeli counter-offensive in the Sinai on October 8, the {{southern}} front remained relatively static and the IAF focused its attention on the Syrian front. While A-4 Skyhawks provided much needed support to <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> at the cost of 31 aircraft by the end of fourth day of the war, IAF Phantoms repeatedly struck Syrian air fields. Following Syrian FROG-7 strikes on military and civilian targets in northern Israel, the IAF also initiated a campaign to destroy the infrastructure on which Syria's war-making capacity depended, targeting strategic targets in Syria such as its oil industry and electricity generating system. By October 13 the Syrians had been pushed back and beyond their initial lines, Damascus had come within range of Israeli artillery and an Iraqi armored brigade, the vanguard of its expeditionary force, was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|During {{his tenure}} as leader of Afghanistan, the Soviets began their withdrawal, and from 1989 until 1992, his {{government}} tried to solve the ongoing civil war without Soviet <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> While direct Soviet assistance ended with the withdrawal, the Soviet Union still supported Najibullah with economic and military aid, while the United States continued its support for the mujahideen. Throughout his tenure, he tried {{to build support for}} his government. Najibullah even tried to portray his government as Islamic, and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an Islamic state and all references of communism were removed. This change, coupled with others, did not win Najibullah any significant support. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Najibullah was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. Najibullah lived in the United Nations headquarters in Kabul until 1996, when the Taliban took Kabul. Taliban hanged his body along with his brothers from a traffic post called Ariana chowk in Kabul on September 26, 1996.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1973, {{with war}} imminent, the IAF began {{preparing}} for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian airfields and anti-aircraft positions. The Israeli government, however, decided against pre-emption. IAF aircraft were therefore {{in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when Yom Kippur War hostilities began at 14:00. The next morning begun with Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, beginning with strikes against Egyptian air bases. Tagar, however, was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent. IAF efforts were redirected north, where the ill-fated Operation Doogman 5 was carried out. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost. The sustained campaign required to defeat enemy air defences was abandoned in the face of Egyptian and Syrian advances and the IAF was forced to operate under the SAM threat. Nevertheless, the close air support it provided allowed Israeli <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive, first in the north and later in the south.|$|E
50|$|General Knowles {{stated that}} he had {{selected}} the initial landing zone used by Hal Moore and his troops, knowing quite well that the enemy lacked anti-aircraft guns and heavy mortars that had been destroyed during the attack of the Plei Me camp and that the enemy could have positioned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillsides overlooking the landing zone to gun down the helicopters and to decimate <b>the</b> cavalry <b>troops</b> landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the start}} of the campaign, there have been {{allegations}} of violating the limits imposed upon the intervention by Resolution 1973 and by US law.

2500|$|The 509th PIB and the 463rd Field Artillery were {{assigned}} an area, designated DZ [...] "C", {{about two miles}} south-east of Le Muy. This area, lying in a basin between two ridges with hills {{to the east and}} west, was steep, rocky, and wooded, with only small areas of level and open ground at either end. It was reluctantly chosen in order to put <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high <b>ground</b> dominating Le Muy from the south.|$|R
25|$|The Israeli Air Force {{formed on}} May 28, 1948, using commandeered or donated {{civilian}} aircraft and obsolete and surplus World War II combat-aircraft. Eventually, more aircraft were procured, including Boeing B-17s, Bristol Beaufighters, de Havilland Mosquitoes and P-51D Mustangs. The Israeli Air Force {{played an important}} part in Operation Kadesh, Israel's part in the 1956 Suez Crisis, dropping paratroopers at the Mitla Pass. On June 5, 1967, {{the first day of the}} Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force executed Operation Focus, crippling the opposing Arab air forces and attaining air supremacy for the remainder of the war. Shortly after the end of the Six-Day War, Egypt initiated the War of Attrition, and the Israeli Air Force undertook repeated bombings of strategic targets deep within enemy territory. When the Yom Kippur War broke out on October 6, 1973, Egyptian and Syrian advances forced the IAF to abandon detailed plans for the destruction of enemy air defences. Forced to operate under the missile and anti-aircraft artillery threat, the close air support it provided allowed Israeli <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive.|$|E
25|$|During early 1918, the Germans {{launched}} a major offensive on the Western Front {{after the collapse}} of Russia allowed them to increase their forces in the west. Falling initially against the British southern flank, the offensive pushed the Allies back significantly, and the squadron was forced to withdraw to airfields further back from the front as German forces advanced steadily: in March it moved to La Bellevue and then to Fouquerolles, remaining there until June when it moved to Liettres to support the French during the Marne offensive. During this time, the squadron was attached to the Royal Air Force's Nos 10, 22, 51 and (finally) 80 wings. Despite the moves, the squadron maintained a high operational tempo, becoming involved in heavy air-to-air combat during fighter sweeps, and also being used to attack advancing German ground forces (see image left). After the German offensive was finally halted, the Allies launched their own offensive in August around Amiens after which the squadron was employed to attack German airfields, and as the Germans were forced back, attacking withdrawing German <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Throughout October, {{in an effort to keep}} up with the advance, the squadron moved three times and by the time the armistice was signed in November it was based at Pont-a-Marq.|$|E
25|$|From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's {{government}} {{tried to}} solve the ongoing civil war with economic and military aid, but without Soviet <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Pakistan's spy agency (ISI), headed by Hamid Gul at the time, was interested in a trans-national Islamic revolution which would cover Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. For this purpose Pakistan masterminded an attack on Jalalabad for the Mujahideen to establish their own government in Afghanistan. Najibullah tried {{to build support for}} his government by portraying his government as Islamic, and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an Islamic state and all references of communism were removed. Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support, and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, he was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992. After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist Islamic State of Afghanistan was established by the Peshawar Accord, a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported Hezb-e Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked {{the beginning of a new}} phase in the war.|$|E
