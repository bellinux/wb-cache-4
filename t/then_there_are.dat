5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every vertex can be mapped to every other vertex by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals {{may also have}} unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E
