500|$|The ZX80's design {{introduced}} many {{key features}} that were carried {{over to the}} ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, [...] "the ZX80 {{was very much a}} stepping stone to the ZX81". The design was driven entirely by the desired price – the machine had to cost less than £100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, [...] "Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine." [...] The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a <b>typewriter-style</b> <b>keyboard,</b> though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and [...] "feel".|$|E
5000|$|Later in the {{production}} run, the [...] "melted" [...] keyboard was replaced with a new, full-travel, <b>typewriter-style</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|With the Apple I and the Apple II, Wozniak {{introduced}} an entirely novel {{configuration of the}} microcomputer concept which was immediately adopted as the industry standard, and remains taken for granted to this day—namely {{the integration of the}} standard input and output devices (the <b>typewriter-style</b> <b>keyboard</b> and the video display screen) into the computer itself. Until that time, microcomputer devices either had an extremely limited I/O capability—such as perhaps a hex keypad and a 16- or 32-character display, or no built-in user interface at all, following the convention of mainframe and minicomputers in requiring the connection of an external teleprinter unit or visual display terminal to complete a usable system. The cost of such terminals could easily exceed the price of the computer itself. Wozniak's inclusion of an RF output which could connect to the aerial socket of a standard domestic television set enabled users to acquire a complete system without incurring the cost of a video monitor.|$|E
500|$|Many non-Sinclair {{peripherals}} {{aimed to}} remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64KB of extra memory and promising to [...] "fit snugly ... giving a firm connection" [...] to the computer, <b>typewriter-style</b> <b>keyboards,</b> more advanced printers and sound generators, and even a hard disk interface, which Clive Sinclair thought was [...] "quite overgilding the lily". A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware. The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the Financial Times noted, [...] "school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians [...] have set up small operations in their own time".|$|R
50|$|The Apple III {{could be}} viewed as an {{enhanced}} Apple II - then the newest heir to a line of 8-bit machines dating back to 1976. However, the Apple III {{was not part of the}} Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true <b>typewriter-style</b> upper/lowercase <b>keyboard</b> (as opposed to the Apple II, which only supported uppercase letters) and 80-column display. In addition, the machine had to pass U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio frequency interference (RFI) qualifications for business equipment. In 1981, International Business Machines (IBM) unveiled the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) - a completely new 16-bit design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the PC DOS/MS-DOS platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.|$|R
