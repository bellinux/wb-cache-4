5|$|Chuck and Sarah turn to Jack to {{help them}} {{continue}} Daphne's con and capture the Zephyr. They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} none of them has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when none of them ever had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at his head.

Kripik departs on foot, but Iva professes her love and goes with him. The Mounties pursue them on foot across the ice, which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye {{and good luck to}} them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults will be able to return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E

5|$|The Countess sends Sandor {{to fetch}} her {{a model to}} paint; he returns with Lili (Nan Grey). Countess Zaleska {{initially}} resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth {{know that it was}} Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth him to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal.

25|$|With a {{title that}} alludes to incompetent leaders sending brave {{soldiers}} into {{the slaughter of}} battle, the film <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at the U.S. government's prosecution of the wars in the Middle East, showing three different simultaneous stories: a senator who launches a new military strategy and details it to a journalist, two soldiers involved in said operation, and their college professor trying to re-engage a promising student by telling him their story. The film was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, and directed by Redford. It was released in North America on November 9, 2007, to negative reviews and disappointing box office receipts.|$|E

Upon learning that the Key is a fake, the Brutes on Mars behead Ackerson. In a relief camp, Tyla writes a song about Ruwan.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} A Flash Flood of Colour is {{politically}} progressive. The album's treatment of current affairs {{and environmental issues}} <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> [...] "at the failings of capitalism, the hypocrisy of modern politics and the blatant disregard of human health and happiness" [...] and {{has been compared to}} the calculated approach of the Occupy movement, rather than an ensuing class conflict. Despite its political themes, Reynolds denied that the album was politically motivated: [...] "This album is anti-politics. We say that politics is an outdated system. It is time that we embrace technological developments and no longer have to rely on a rule. Our lives should develop according to scientific findings." [...] He described A Flash Flood of Colours recurring theme as [...] "perspective": [...] "We're not trying to think subjectively." [...] The Real News, Democracy Now! and journalist John Pilger have all influenced Reynolds' political views.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] {{talks about}} Aguilera {{adopting}} a new persona and new musical experiments. At the beginning, Aguilera admits that [...] "Tonight I'm {{feeling a little}} out of control". At the pre-chorus, she sings [...] "The old me's gone and I feel brand new, and if you don't like it, fuck you", which <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, [...] "I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl". The song also evokes sexual theme, with lyrics such as [...] "I'm dancin' a lot, I'm takin' shots and I'm feelin' fine/ I'm kissin' all the boys and girls". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a [...] "more 'Euro-glamorous' version" [...] of her previous alter ego [...] "Xtina", featured in her 2002 hit [...] "Dirrty" [...] from Stripped.|$|E

The rest of Pike's gang returns to Agua Verde for shelter, where a bacchanal celebrating the weapons transfer has commenced; they see Angel [...] being dragged {{on the ground}} by a rope tied behind the general's car. After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture. The general appears to comply; however, as they watch, the general instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache {{down in front of}} his men. For a moment, the federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to laugh in surprise. Pike calmly <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.|$|E
500|$|... "Thirsty" [...] is a [...] "club-friendly" [...] R {{song with}} an {{influence}} of hip hop music, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 26 seconds. [...] "Thirsty" [...] {{is about how}} Carey's lover has a thirst for fame which causes her to drown in her own misery. Billy Johnson, Jr. for Yahoo! Music described the track as [...] " [...] those desperate for attention." [...] The singer is [...] "taking center stage as she <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at a starfucker" [...] as she performs her [...] "nonchalant" [...] verses over a [...] "skittering" [...] minimal synth beat. The songs begins {{with the sound of}} a drink being poured into a glass, after which the instrumental begins to play and Carey sings line [...] "You used to be Mr. All About Me, now you're just thirsty for celebrity" [...] in her upper register, then continues to ask her suitor [...] "Why you try so damn hard?" [...] During the chorus, Carey repeatedly sings the hook [...] "Uh, you're Thirs-tay/ Uh, you're Thirs-tay".|$|E
500|$|Chris Morran of Consumerist said Philip Morris did a [...] "really {{poor job}} of trying to defend its actions". He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic {{non-response}} in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth." [...] He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle — or realizes a battle can't be won — then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules.|$|E

500|$|Pete Wentz {{was once}} again the primary lyricist of the band during the {{production}} of the album. Stump said that Wentz [...] "totally outdid himself on this record. He doesn't even know how good his lyrics are here." [...] Wentz, despite many recent personal developments (marriage to Ashlee Simpson, birth of his son, Bronx), desired to shift the focus away from himself and turn it outward onto the world. For the first time on a Fall Out Boy album, Folie is rarely autobiographical, as the band believed the format was [...] "losing its luster" [...] because [...] "everyone was doing it." [...] The songs on the album explore decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. Stump tagged Folie à Deux as a [...] "message record" [...] that <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at [...] "the materialistic dance between any two parties obsessed with each other, whether it's teenage girls and handbag makers, politicians and lobbyists or tabloids and stars." [...] Folie à Deux also dissects how self-motivated American culture is, and many of the lyrics are intended to be satirical. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that <b>takes</b> <b>aim</b> at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They are the ones who are actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E
