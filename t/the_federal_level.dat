The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the association between breastfeeding and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Poverty <b>Level</b> in <b>the</b> United States.

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009.

Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>level</b> was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
