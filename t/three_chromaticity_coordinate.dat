40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{incorporate}} astaxanthin to yogurts with different fat content to match apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) color. The samples containing astaxanthin were stored at 5 ± 3 °C, and color stability and astaxanthin content were determined by colorimetry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. Yogurt samples were analyzed in triplicate every 24 hours for one week and subsequently every week for 3 more weeks There were no significant differences (p < 0. 05) between astaxanthin concentration values at 0 and 28 days for both samples; therefore, it can be said that the fat content in the yogurt had not effect on the stability of pigment. The low dispersion of the data showed uniformity in the <b>three</b> <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> L*, a*, b* throughout the storage period for both types of yogurt. Values of &# 8710;E &# 8805; 5. 0 were not obtained at any time during storage, indicating high stability of the pigment...|$|R

With {{the main purpose of}} check the preliminary performance of the reference system used in the Radiometry Laboratory of Inmetro, four color samples were measured. On the first stage, the characterization of the samples was done at the IEN using a special goniophotometer, which doesnt need calibration of the detector and use an absolute measurement technique. Spectral measurements were made on typical configurations of lighting and reflecting conditions for colorimetric characterization of materials, 0 / 45 and 45 / 0. Photometric measurements were carried out by using a V(λ) filter in front of the detector and an illuminant A source at incident angles 0 ° and 45 °. In the colorimetric and photometric cases, the results of measurements were respectively the <b>three</b> <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> calculated by the reflection factor (ρ), and the luminance associated to each direction.

40|$|Subject of research. The {{problem of}} {{software-based}} compensation of technological variation in <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> of liquid crystal panels is considered. A method of software-based compensation of technological variation in <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> is proposed. The method provides the color reproduction {{characteristics of the}} series-produced samples on-board indication equipment corresponding to the sample equipment, which is taken as the standard. Method. Mathematical calculation of the profile is performed for the given model of the liquid crystal panel. The coefficients that correspond to the typical values of the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the vertices of the triangle color coverage constitute a reference mathematical model of the plate LCD panel from a specific manufacturer. At the stage of incoming inspection the sample of the liquid crystal panel, {{that is to be}} implemented within indication equipment, is mounted on the lighting test unit, where Nokia-Test control is provided by the formation of the RGB codes for display the image of a homogeneous field in the red, green, blue and white. The measurement of the (x,y) -chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors is performed using a colorimeter with the known value of absolute error. Instead of using lighting equipment, such measurements may be carried out immediately on the sample indication equipment during customizing procedure. The measured values are used to calculate individual LCD-panel profile coefficients through the use of Grassman's transformation, establishing mutual relations between the XYZ-color coordinates and RGB codes to be used for displaying the image on the liquid crystal panel. The obtained coefficients are to be set into the memory of the graphics controller together with the functional software and then used for image displaying. Main results. The efficiency of the proposed method of software-based compensation for technological variation of <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> of liquid crystal panel was estimated by the ratio criterion of the areas of cross sections of the histograms p(x,y) at a given probability confidence level, calculated before and after compensation procedure. The sections of histograms, representing distributions of <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> were obtained by mathematical simulation in MathCad 15. 0. The simulation software of the method of software-based compensation gives the possibility to obtain the mutual arrangement between the figures formed by sections of the histograms of (x,y) -chromaticity coordinates, and it may be observed as significant reduction of the area after compensation procedure is performed, and changes in the geometry of the cross section shape as well. Sets of dependency curves were obtained, depicting the efficiency criterion value versus resolution of the colorimeter that is used for measuring the <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Practical relevance.

We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluation of <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> shift for image displayed on liquid crystal panels with various properties on color reproduction. A mathematical model represents the color reproduction characteristics. The spread of the color characteristics of the screens has a statistical nature. Differences of color reproduction for screens are perceived by the observer {{in the form of}} different colors and shades that are displayed on the same type of commercially available screens. Color differences are characterized by numerical measure of the difference of colors and can be mathematically compensated. The solution of accounting problem of the statistical nature of the color characteristics spread for the screens has a particular relevance to aviation instrumentation. Method. Evaluation of <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> shift of the image is based on the application of the Grassmann laws of color mixing. Basic data for quantitative calculation of shift are the profiles of two different liquid crystal panels defined by matrixes of scales for components of primary colors (red, green, blue). The calculation is based on solving the system of equations and calculating the color difference in the XY-plane. In general, the calculation can be performed in other color spaces: UV, Lab. The statistical nature of the spread of the color characteristics for the screens is accounted for in the proposed mathematical model based on the interval setting of coordinate values of the color gamut triangle vertices on the set of commercially available samples. Main Results. Carried outresearches result in the mathematical expressions allowing to recalculate values of <b>chromaticity</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the image displayed on various samples of liquid crystal screens.
