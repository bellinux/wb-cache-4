5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E

A Seafire {{equipped with a}} reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments.

The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago.
