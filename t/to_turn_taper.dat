50|$|The turning {{processes}} are typically {{carried out on}} a lathe, {{considered to be the}} oldest machine tools, and can be of four different types such as straight <b>turning,</b> <b>taper</b> <b>turning,</b> profiling or external grooving. Those types of turning processes can produce various shapes of materials such as straight, conical, curved, or grooved workpiece.In general, turning uses simple single-point cutting tools. Each group of workpiece materials has an optimum set of tools angles which have been developed through the years.|$|R

50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or top slide) (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for <b>turning</b> <b>tapers,</b> <b>to</b> control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMachining process {{models can}} be used to predict cutting force/power and further {{optimize}} the process parameters. In this work, a mechanistic cutting force model for turning processes is developed. In order to accurately predict cutting forces, the cutting tool edge is discretized and an approach for calculating the chip load corresponding to each discretized edge segment is developed. Approach for calculating effective tool angles is also developed considering effects of the tool corner radius and the change of feed direction. By using the yield shear stress of the work material, the friction angle between work and tool material, the chip load and the effective tool angles for each tool edge segment, the distributions of the turning forces and force intensity along the tool edge can be predicted. Turning cases of straight <b>turning,</b> contour <b>turning,</b> <b>taper</b> <b>turning</b> and facing are tested and the model outputs include the distributions of the instantaneous effective tool angles, chip load, cutting force coefficients and force intensity. Test results for straight turning and contour turning operations are analyzed to demonstrate the model capability. The distributions of force and force intensity on tool edge provide useful information for prediction of turning forces/power and potential further prediction of tool wear/life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) fast tool servo driven by piezoelectric actuators for real time error compensation in <b>taper</b> <b>turning</b> is described. A 2 D tool post {{is made with}} a new structure with three leaf springs for each axis and its mounting platform positions at a corner, which makes it convenient for mounting the cutter. A control technique, “Forecasting Compensatory Control” (FCC), is implemented to perform an on-line prediction of the machining errors encountered. The on-line cutting experimental results have verified that an improvement of about 40 % was achieved for roundness error of the workpiece in the <b>taper</b> <b>turning</b> operation by using the developed control algorithm...|$|R

The Columbia Jl. 1 anufacturing Company mill complex, {{built over}} the years between ca. 1850 and ca. 1920, {{consists}} of a three-story gable roof structure, built in three stages, with a southeast corner power plant, a west side four-story tower and two wings, and several freestanding auxiliary buildings [...] an office, pump house, and -house, located northwest of the main buildingc The orri-ginal mill (l),-b 1 +ilt ca. 1850, is the two-story rectangular south section, eleven bays long and five bays wide, whose narrow south end abuts a mill race parallel to the Deep River. This section is of brick laid in one-to-three cammon bond, and each bay is pierced by a nine-aver-nine sash window with a plain wooden sill and an ovalo-molded surround, surmounted by a simple brick lintel. No original doors remain. Each interior floor is one large room with one row of eleven posts supporting the wooden ceiling joists {{at the center of}} the span.

The tailstock can be positioned along the bed and clamped (T6) in position as dictated by the work piece. There is also provision to offset the tailstock (T4) from the spindles axis, this is useful for <b>turning</b> small <b>tapers,</b> and when re-aligning the tailstock to the axis of the bed.|$|R

50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} steering wheel is <b>turned</b> more <b>to</b> get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. A lower {{steering ratio}} means that the steering wheel is <b>turned</b> less <b>to</b> get the wheels turning, but it will be harder <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher steering ratio, which will make the steering wheel easier <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the steering wheel. In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier <b>to</b> <b>turn,</b> so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The steering wheel is therefore harder <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|R
