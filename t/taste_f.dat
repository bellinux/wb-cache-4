50|$|The cap is convex to {{flattened}} (sometimes with {{a shallow}} umbo), measuring 5 - 12 cm in diameter. Its color is bright-yellow to orange-yellow {{and then later}} brownish, and it has flattened brownish scales over the center. The whitish cap margin is rolled inward. The well-separated gills have tooth-like edges, and an adnate attachment to the stipe, sometimes with a notch. They are initially white before turning cream in maturity. The stipe measures 3 - 8 cm long by 1 - 2.5 cm wide, and is roughly the same width throughout. Shiny with a light yellow-brown base color, it has one to several cottony zones of partial veil remnants. The flesh is firm, and white to yellow under the cap cuticle. It has no distinguishable odor and a mild <b>taste.</b> <b>F.</b> albolanaripes mushrooms are edible.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the quality of drinking water used by community and their perception towards water quality. Water samples were collected from hand pump, motor pump and tube well. Total 160 households were surveyed to check their perception against drinking water quality. The results showed the values of bacteriological parameter fecal coliform were above WHO guidelines which made water unfit for drinking purposes. The community was unaware of the quality of water they were drinking. Women with higher education had perception of smell (F = 3. 51, p< 0. 01), <b>taste</b> (<b>F</b> = 3. 10, p< 0. 05) and turbidity in water (F = 5. 34, p< 0. 01). Incidence of water borne diseases especially in infants appeared to be common problem among the sampled households in the study region. Lack of proper water supply system, proper sanitation and drainage facility were the common and contributing to poor health of people...|$|E

We point out the influence of religion (both positive and negative) on individual. These issues are viewed {{from the perspective of}} some famous theories. For example: G. S. Becker's Accounting for <b>Tastes,</b> <b>F.</b> A. Hayek's theory of spontaneous order, H. Bergson's philosophy or M. Weber's sociology of religion.

40|$|Of {{all human}} senses {{our ability to}} detect odours may be the least {{appreciated}} and certainly the least understood [1], and yet is one o f the most powerful. Humans can only see a narrow region o f the light spectrum (300 - 700 ran), hear a small range in the frequency spectrum (20 - 20 KHz), touch objects that are close. The smell and <b>taste</b> o <b>f</b> substances however can give us much more information about an objects nature. However quantifying these senses is difficult. The <b>taste</b> o <b>f</b> substances has been provisionally classed as being Sour, Bitter, Sweet or Salty. Smells have been classed as being camphoraceous, ethereal, floral, minty, musky, pungent or putrid [2], but this {{has been described as}} being over simplistic [3], Therefore to mimic the nose it is necessary to understand how the nose function...|$|R

Postmodern tastes favoured discontinuous narratives {{and the introduction of}} the [...] "first person", yet they were more favourable to Scott's work than Modernist <b>tastes.</b> While <b>F.</b> R. Leavis had disdained Scott, seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence (The Great Tradition 1948), György Lukács (The Historical Novel trans. 1962) and David Daiches (Scott's Achievement as a Novelist 1951) offered a Marxian political reading of Scott's fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work. Scott is now seen as an important innovator and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature, and particularly as the inventor of the historical novel.|$|R

Enormous amounts o f moneys has been invested in any new idea beginning with cm E. Fabulous profits were expected, over night, just because the companies were on the Internet or because they used the newest technology. But the soap bubble growing while the mo-ney was pumped eventually blow up. One o f tlie more significant barriers to e-business development is the overlooked or underestimated cost o f the project deve-lopment together with the lack o f a good project management. These are ones o f critical issues that are almost ignored by tlie dot. coms. This position is more evident in tlie countries where the information technology lias a low level o f development. Most organizations are not focused on tlie project management and costs with all phases involved by an e-business project.

30|$|When a {{consumer}} purchases a wine they have previously not tasted, {{they will need}} to rely on attributes of the wine to determine the expected taste and quality of the wine, <b>f</b> (<b>taste,</b> quality) in (1). Four classes of attributes are considered: indirectly observable wine characteristics, directly observable wine characteristics, measures of wine quality, and winery characteristics. Indirectly observable wine characteristics arise from production practices. These could be flavors that result from aging in an oak barrel or sweetness that arises from adding sugar to the wine. 1 For {{a consumer}} purchasing a wine that they have not consumed before, they have some idea of what these production practices contribute to the wine without knowing exactly what they contribute to the specific wine. There are wine characteristics that are directly observable such as the percent alcohol, the variety, the wine region, and the vintage. Third, there are subjective measures of quality such as references in wine guides, Robert Parker ratings, and Grand Cru designations. Finally, there are characteristics of the winery that may influence a consumer’s valuation of the wine. These could include certification by the Fédération Nationale Interprofessionnelle des Vins de l’Agriculture Biologique (FNIVAB), a private organic-certifying agency in France, which may increase value for consumers concerned about purchasing certified organic products. They could also include the size of the winery or the popularity of the winery. Finally, the inclusion of SO 2 will influence the expected utility of the wine through the two mechanisms discussed above.|$|R
40|$|Orally {{disintegrating}} tablets (ODTs) {{are capable}} of turning quickly into a liquid dosage form {{in contact with the}} saliva, thus possessing the advantages of both the solid dosage forms particularly stability and liquid dosage forms specially ease of swallowing and pre-gastric absorption of drug. The aim {{of this study was to}} prepare a novel matrix-type buccal fast disintegrating ibuprofen tablet formulation using special polymers, water soluble excipients, super-disintegrants and quickly soluble granules. For this purpose different tablet formulations of ibuprofen were prepared. The amount of ibuprofen in each formulation was 100 mg. Eight groups of formulation were prepared (A-H series), accounting for a total number of 45 formulations. Formulations prepared were examined in terms of different physicochemical tests including powder/granule flowability, appearance, thickness, uniformity of weight, hardness, friability and disintegration time. Results of formulation F 22 a (in series F), was found to be acceptable, making it the chosen formulation for further studies. Then, by adding various flavorants and sweeteners to this formulation, complementary series of formulations, named G and H, were prepared. Following the comparison of their taste with each other through asking 10 volunteers, the most suitable formulation regarding the <b>taste,</b> being formulation <b>F</b> 22 s, was chosen as the ultimate formulation. This formulation had PVP, ibuprofen and croscarmellose as the intra-granular components and xylitol and saccharin as the extra-granular ingredients. Formulation F 22 s was found to be acceptable in terms of physicochemical tests conducted, showing quick disintegration within the buccal cavity, appropriate hardness and rather low friability. Hence formulation F 22 s was selected as the final formulation...|$|R
