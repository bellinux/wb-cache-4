5|$|Phantom II {{production}} {{ended in}} the United States in 1979 after 5,195 had been built (5,057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi). Of these, 2,874 went to the USAF, 1,264 to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the rest to foreign customers. The last U.S.-built F-4 went to South Korea, while the last F-4 built was an F-4EJ built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan and delivered on 20 May 1981. As of 2008, 631 Phantoms were in service worldwide, while the Phantoms were in use as a <b>target</b> <b>drone</b> (specifically QF-4Cs) operated by the U.S. military until December 21, 2016, when the Air Force officially ended use of the type.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} years, <b>target</b> <b>drones</b> were often {{launched}} from aircraft; or off a rail using solid-fuel rocket assisted takeoff (RATO) boosters; or hydraulic, electromagnetic, or pneumatic catapult.
