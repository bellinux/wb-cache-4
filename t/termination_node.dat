This logic combines a simple syntax with a high expressivity; it can distinguish frames that {{are not the same}} as sets of transitions and states. We show how Dicky logic and CTL can be embedded in TFL. 1 Introduction In recent years, a multitude of process algebras have evolved. Bergstra and Ponse [8, 9] proposed to study basic properties of such process algebras on the level of frames, which are labelled, directed graphs. Essentially, frames are transition systems without explicit start and <b>termination</b> <b>nodes.</b> Frames can be converted into processes by means of process extraction, which means that two states are singled out, which represent the start state and the successful termination state respectively. Thus, the algebra of frames constitutes a common platform for the study of basic properties of process algebras. In [7], frames have been extended with discrete time, following [4], and with signals, [...] ...|$|R

Node battery power is a precious resource that {{should be used in}} order to avoid the early <b>termination</b> of <b>nodes.</b> Node power consumption is reduced by vary transition time. Power control with transition time is proposed to control power consumption in mobile ad-hoc network. Simulation model has been used to analysis the energy consumption of a node. This has been achieved by estimating the time spent in each activity by a node. The proposed model has been simulated using simulator.

Presently, these systems are limited by poor thermal conductivity of the adsorption bed, and thus our research addresses how the interfaces between grains of MOF- 5 can be engineered to improve heat conduction. In this work we show that by understanding the dominant modes responsible for transmitting heat across the interface we design 3 different types of interface for MOF- 5 model (by changing the surface <b>termination),</b> exposed <b>node</b> interface, linker-end interface and hydroxyl-end interface, as the possible results of synthesis and simulate the interfacial heat transport.

30|$|A {{decision}} tree {{can be used}} for both continuous and nominal target variables. When a {{decision tree}} is used to predict a continuous target variable, it is called a regression tree, and when it is used to classify a nominal target variable, it is called a classification tree [32]. Two main components of decision trees are the “root node” and the “leaf node.” The root node is the node located {{at the top of the}} tree and contains all the data, and the “leaf node” refers to the <b>termination</b> <b>node</b> and has the lowest impurity. More specifically, based on the independent variable (splitter) that creates the best homogeneity, the root node is divided into two child nodes. This procedure (partitioning the target variable recursively) will be continued until all the data in each node reach their highest homogeneity; then, tree growing will stop. This node, which does not have any branches, is called the “leaf node,” and each path from the top of the tree (the root node) to each leaf (the terminal node) can be considered as a rule. It is worth mentioning that data in each child node are purer (more homogenous) than the data in the upper parent node [33]. In order to find possible splits among all variables, a splitting criterion (test) is performed. Splitting criterion is the main design component of a decision tree [34]. More specifically, in the decision tree learning algorithm, the splitting criterion’s role is to measure the quality of each possible split among all variables. Two common splitting criteria that can be used to grow a decision tree are Chi-square and Gini reduction. In this study, Gini splitting criterion is used to select which variable and split pattern will be used to best split the node.|$|E

The goal {{is to find a}} protocol for local computation which, starting with a uniform labelling of graph nodes, eventually terminates with a labelling being an enumeration of nodes. It is known from [4] that for some ("ambiguous") graphs of the considered family such a protocol does not exist; in the present paper a protocol is constructed which {{is the best in the}} sense that, for a given graph, it either enumerates nodes of the graph, or supplies a proof of ambiguity of the graph. It is proved that for any graph there exists a computation terminating with any a priori given enumeration of its nodes. It is also proved that after successful <b>termination</b> individual <b>nodes</b> "know" this fact. The proposed protocol can be used for election a leader out of nodes of graphs; in this way it generalizes existing algorithms. The protocol is called distributed, since remote nodes of the processed graph can communicate only by send [...] ...|$|R

Link based ranking algorithms such as PageRank, HITS, and other derivatives are especially vulnerable to link spam. Link farms and link exchanges are two common instances of link spam that produce spam communities – i. e., clusters in the web graph. In this paper, we present a directed approach to extracting link spam communities when given one or more members of the community. In contrast to previous completely automated approaches to finding link spam, our method is specifically designed to be used interactively. Our approach starts with a small spam seed set provided by the user and simulates a random walk on the web graph. The random walk is biased to explore the local neighborhood around the seed set through the use of decay probabilities. Truncation is used to retain only the most frequently visited <b>nodes.</b> After <b>termination,</b> the <b>nodes</b> are sorted in decreasing order of their final probabilities and presented to the user. Experiments using manually labeled link spam data sets and random walks from a single seed domain show that the approach achieves over 95. 12 % precision in extracting large link farms and 80. 46 % precision in extracting link exchange centroids...|$|R
40|$|A {{major issue}} in the ad hoc {{networks}} with energy constraints is to find ways that increase their lifetime. The use of multihop radio relaying requires {{a sufficient number of}} relaying nodes to maintainnetwork connectivity. Hence, battery power is a precious resource that must be used efficiently in order to avoid early <b>termination</b> of any <b>node.</b> In this paper, a new battery power scheduling policy based on dynamic programming is proposed for mobile devices. This policy makes use of the state information of each cell provided by the smart battery package and uses the strategy of dynamic programming to optimally satisfy a request for power. Using extensive simulation it is proved that dynamic programming based schedulingpolicyimproves the lifetime of the mobile nodes. Also a hardware support is proposed to succeeds in distinguishing between real-time and non-real-time traffic and provides the appropriate grade of service, to meet the time constraints associated with real time traffic...|$|R
40|$|A {{major issue}} with ad-hoc {{networks}} is energy consumption since nodes are usually mobile and battery-operated. In this project {{we compared the}} performance of ad-hoc routing protocols in a network where each participating mobile node has a given battery life and will shut-down when a threshold is reached. We studied two routing protocols, Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV), by comparing the <b>node</b> <b>termination</b> rate {{as well as the}} over-all goodput of the network. From the simulations we observed that in high node density, DSR performs better than DSDV. The performance gap can be decreased by smaller number of nodes in the A Wireless Ad-Hoc network is a cooperative engagement of a collection of wireless mobile nodes. Since some receiving nodes may be out of the direct range of a sending node, intermediate nodes have to act as routers to forward the data to the receiving nodes.

In 2008, a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with {{a diameter of}} 60 mm appeared and surgical resection was performed. In March 2011, the patient was referred to our hospital because of portal lymph node swelling. Abdominal ultrasonography, dynamic CT and dynamic MRI did not show any tumors in the liver, but revealed portal lymph node swelling (18 × 11 mm). Taking the elevation of serum des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and alpha-fetoprotein levels, including the lectin-bound type, into consideration, we made the diagnosis of HCC metastasis to the portal lymph node. We started sorafenib therapy at a dose of 800 mg/day, but discontinued it after 11 days due to grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction and rash. In spite of treatment <b>termination,</b> portal lymph <b>node</b> swelling disappeared and the serum des-γ-carboxy prothrombin and alpha-fetoprotein levels normalized.

40|$|Abstract—Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) -based {{model is}} a simple yet {{powerful}} tool to analyze MIMO’s spatial multiplexing (SM) and interference cancellation (IC) capabilities in a multi-hop network. Recently, a new DoF model was proposed and was shown {{to achieve the same}} rate region as the matrix-based model (under SM and IC). The essence of this new DoF {{model is a}} novel node ordering concept, which eliminates potential duplication of DoF allocation for IC. In this paper, we investigate DoF scheduling for a multi-hop MIMO network based on this new DoF model. Specifically, we study how to perform DoF allocation among the nodes for SM and IC so as to maximize the minimum rate among a set of sessions. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and develop an efficient DoF scheduling algorithm to solve it. We show that our algorithm is amenable to local implementation and has polynomial time complexity. More importantly, it guarantees the feasibility of final solution (upon algorithm <b>termination),</b> despite that <b>node</b> ordering establishment and adjustment are performed locally. Simulation results show that our algorithm can offer a result that is close to an upper bound found by CPLEX solver, thus showing that the result found by our algorithm is highly competitive.

40|$|Development of the {{efficient}} power aware protocol {{is the need}} of today s adhoc networks. Although developing battery efficient systems that have low cost and complexity, remains a crucial issue. In order to facilitate communication within a mobile adhoc network, an efficient routing protocol is required to discover routes between mobile nodes. Power {{is one of the}} most important design criteria for adhoc networks as batteries provide limited working capacity to the mobile nodes. Power failure of a mobile node not only affects the node itself but also its ability to forward packets on behalf of others and hence affects the overall network lifetime. Much research efforts have been devoted to develop energy aware routing protocols. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm, which maximizes the network lifetime by minimizing the power consumption during the source to destination route establishment. As a case study proposed algorithm has been incorporated along with the route discovery procedure of AODV and by simulation it is observed that proposed algorithm s perperformance is better as compare to AODV and DSR in terms of various energy related parameters like Total Energy Consumption, Average Energy Left Per Alive <b>Node,</b> <b>Node</b> <b>Termination</b> Rate, and Network Lifetime for different network scenarios.

40|$|In current {{practice}} architecture restructuring requires a high manual effort {{for understanding the}} existing system and the defintion of a mapping of its elements to a target architecture. Our model-based architecture restructuring approach supports reengineers by semi-automating this task. This paper presents the first results of an industrial case study with a large productive system. 1 Model-Based Architecture Restructuring Our approach to model-based architecture restructuring {{is based on a}} structural model of the existing system and a model of the target architecture. The connection between the two models is created by an initial mapping model which maps {{a small part of the}} structural elements of the system (e. g. files, classes and methods) to components of the target architecture. Based on the initial mapping a graph clustering algorithm is used to create a complete mapping of all structural elements to target components. The algorithm implements a variant of hierarchical clustering which considers the target architecture in its <b>termination</b> condition. The <b>nodes</b> of the graph are the structural elements of the system while the edges represent the dependencies between these elements. The edges are weighted according to the types of the dependencies. The distance function used for the hierarchical clustering is the sum of these weights. The approach is iterative in order to improve the clustering result by changing the initial mapping, dependency weights or the target architecture. Furthermore, iterations can be used to allow the stepwise restructuring of the system in horizontal or vertical partitions. A more detailed description of the approach can be found in [2]...|$|R
40|$|The {{switches}} and routers of large scale networks cannot manage a state per user session. The burden of memory management would overwhelm the network. Therefore, {{it is important}} to find distributed network algorithms which hold a state only at the initiating <b>node.</b> <b>Termination</b> detection algorithms are particularly interesting, since they can be used in the implementation of other stateless algorithms. The importance of stateless termination detection is apparent in mulitcast trees. Multicast trees are commonly used to multicast messages across the network. In many cases the mulitcast message represents a request sent from the root node that must be answered by all the leaves of the tree. In most networks the leaves could send their answer directly to the root. Unfortunately, the root would {{have no way of knowing}} when all the leaves answered the request. Broadcast-echo algorithms are often used in this case, but these algorithms require a state in the internal nodes of the mulitcast tree. Nack oriented protocols are also common, particularly in reliable multicast implementations. These algorithms are optimized for continues downstream information from the source to the destinations rather than for transactional request-reply operations. We present a simple algorithm for termination detection in trees and DAGs which does not require managing a state in the nodes of the graph. The algorithm works even if the graph changes during the execution. For a tree with n nodes, the number of bits added to each message is O(log n). We also discuss how this algorithm may be used in general graphs...|$|R
