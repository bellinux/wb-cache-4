5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company.

She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The circumstantial evidence was enough to convict him and he is sent <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a critical failure for its improbable plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
