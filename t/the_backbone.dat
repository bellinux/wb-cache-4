40|$|Abstract — This paper reports {{some recent}} {{analysis}} and modeling results obtained while developing a tele-robotic system for {{minimally invasive surgery}} of the throat. One of the main enabling components of this system is a Distal Dexterity Unit that implements a novel design using a flexible multi-backbone snake-like unit with actuation redundancy and push-pull actuation. The design of this snake-like unit is compared to other alternative designs that use a single flexible-backbone and wire-actuation. A unified kinematic and virtual work model is used to perform this comparison between a multi-backbone snake like unit with an equal-diameter snake-like unit using a single flexible backbone and wire actuation. The comparison is presented for several actuation redundancy resolutions that minimize the load on <b>the</b> flexible <b>backbones.</b> <b>The</b> {{results show that the}} multi-backbone design is superior to the alternative wire-actuated designs using a single flexible <b>backbone.</b> <b>The</b> advantages manifest in smaller required actuation forces on <b>the</b> <b>backbones</b> and, as a result, a reduced risk of buckling of <b>the</b> <b>backbones</b> and enhanced potential downsize scalability.
