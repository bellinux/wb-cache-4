It was found that dose adjustments make it possible to combine the antiretroviral protease inhibitor lopinavir with the <b>tuberculostatic</b> <b>drug</b> rifampin. Furthermore other studies showed that dose adjustments in case of subtherapeutic plasma drug concentrations were not always successful.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{cost-effective}} method by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) {{was developed and}} validated for the simultaneous determination of the antituberculosis drugs isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide (PYR), and rifampicin (RIF) in tablets. A 40 mmol L - 1 sodium tetraborate background electrolyte (BGE) solution (pH 9. 0) {{was found to be}} suitable for separation of all the analytes. An uncoated fused-silica capillary of 64. 5 cm length (effective length 56 cm) was used for chromatography separation. All analytes were completely separated within 5 min at an applied voltage of 20 kV (max. 50 µA), and detection was performed at 269. 5 nm with an UV detector. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness. The linearities of the calibration curves for INH, PYR, and RIF were 40 - 120 µg/mL (r 2 = 0. 9994), 20 - 100 µg/mL (r 2 = 0. 9997), and 40 - 100 µg/mL (r 2 = 0. 9999), respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of the <b>tuberculostatic</b> <b>drugs</b> RIF, INH, and PYR in tablets.

40|$|The <b>tuberculostatic</b> <b>drug</b> {{rifampicin}} {{has been}} described as a scavenger of reactive species. Additionally, the recent demonstration that oral therapy with a complex of rifampicin and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was more effective than rifampicin alone, in an animal model of experimental leprosy, suggested the importance of redox reactions involving rifampicin and their relevance to the mechanism of action. Hence, we studied the oxidation of rifampicin catalyzed by HRP, since this enzyme may represent the prototype of peroxidation-mediated reactions. We found that the antibiotic is efficiently oxidized and that rifampicin-quinone is the product, in a reaction dependent on both HRP and hydrogen peroxide. The steady-state kinetic constants Km app (101 ± 23 mmol/l), Vmax app (0. 78 ± 0. 09 μmol/l·s- 1) and kcat (5. 1 ± 0. 6 s- 1) were measured (n= 4). The reaction rate was increased by the addition of co-substrates such as tetramethylbenzidine, salicylic acid, 5 -aminosalicylic acid and paracetamol. This effect was explained by invoking an electron-transfer mechanism by which these drugs acted as mediators of rifampicin oxidation. We suggested that this drug interaction might be important at the inflammatory site. © 2005 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of polymeric micelle-forming tuberculostatic prodrugs and the antimycobacterial activity of these prodrugs. Method: By the condensation of hydroxymethylpyrazinamide, isoniazid and rifampin with free carboxyl groups on the copolymer poly(ethyleneglycol) -poly(aspartic acid), micelle-forming carrier-drug conjugates were obtained. These micelles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, to measure the micelle diameter; by acid-base titration, to determine the percentage of carboxylic groups occupied by the tuberculostatic; by Sudan III solubility tests, to estimate the critical micelle concentration (CMC); and visual control and spectrophotometric measurement, to determine the stability of micelles. These micelles were tested in vitro against several Mycobacterium strains. Results: As expected, the size and distribution of the micelle-forming tuberculostatic prodrugs found to be small (78. 2 nm, 84. 2 nm and 98. 9 nm) while {{the level of the}} drug conjugated was high (65. 02 - 85. 7 %). Furthermore, the micelles were stable in vitro, exhibiting a low level of CMC and stronger antimycobacterial activity than the original drugs. Conclusion: the results demonstrate that polymeric micelles can be used as efficient carriers for drugs, which alone, exhibit undesired pharmacokinetics, poor solubility, and low stability.

40|$|By {{incorporating}} a known tuberculostatic agent {{on one end}} of a surface-active molecule, an increased in vitro effect on the tubercle bacillus has been obtained. This activity is presumably due to the concentration of the drug molecules at or beneath the mycobacterial cell boundary. Whether the surface-active drug actually penetrates the lipid, or lipoprotein complex that is so characteristic of the mycobacteria is only problematic. According to comparable purely physical-chemical experiments, such a penetration is quite likely. Increase in tuberculostatic effect of over 1000 -fold has been attained by rendering surface-active the drugs included in this study. The quantitative evaluation of this increase in activity has been obtained by measuring drug action both when its surface-active properties are functional, and when these properties have been selectively abolished by a specific surface-active antagonist. It is believed that the molecular orientation of a surface-active drug about a bacterial cell accounts for one component of its antibacterial action. Certain previously described surface-active antituberculous drugs and antibiotics have been examined in light of this interpretation. It may be anticipated that the more potent <b>tuberculostatic</b> <b>drugs</b> such as streptomycin could be made more effective by incorporating the molecule into a surface-active compound, according to the principles herein described...|$|R

Proper comprehension and clinical management of co-infected TB/HIV patients is still a challenge, particularly in places like Brazil, where both types of infection are prevalent. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the frequency of the clinical forms of TB in HIV-infected patients; correlate the clinical forms of TB with the level of immunodeficiency; evaluate the response to therapy with different regimens for the treatment of TB; identify potential prognostic factors in TB/HIV patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The following data were collected {{at the beginning of the}} study: medical history, epidemiological background, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation (complete blood cell count, T lymphocyte subsets, viral load and tuberculin test). Monthly clinical follow-up was performed, with attention to adverse reactions to <b>tuberculostatic</b> <b>drugs.</b> TCD 4 +/CD 8 + lymphocyte counts and quantification of the viral load were performed after 2, 4, 6, 10 and 15 months of follow-up. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 78 patients (45 males and 33 females) and their mean age was 36. 4 ± 7. 9 years The mean TCD 4 + count values were higher in patients with the cavitary pulmonary form and lower in patients with disseminated forms. There were no significant differences in the mean TCD 8 + cells counts. in the different clinical forms of TB. However, the mean laboratory values for hemoglobin, hematocrit and leucocytes at study entry did differ significantly among the various clinical forms of TB. At the end of the trial, the Tb recovery rate was of 78 %, with four cases (5 %) of treatment failure, eight (11 %) treatment discontinuations and five deaths (6. 4 %). The highest rate of treatment failure (75 %) was observed among patients with the disseminated form. Lower TCD 4 + mean values were observed in cases of treatment failure and death. There was a correlation between the TCD 4 + cell values and the TB outcome at the six time points. TCD 8 + (cells/mm³) mean values assessed at the six time points in relation to the TB outcome indicated (non-significantly) lower values in patients who progressed to treatment failure. Considering the different TB outcomes, there was a significant correlation between TCD 8 + values at the first and third assessments. Lower mean values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet and leukocytes were observed among the cases of treatment failure than in patients who recovered. The variables hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes and platelets were significantly different among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary forms of TB were most frequent in HIV infected patients; the extrapulmonary, associated and disseminated forms were predominantly seen in patients with a more severe level of immunosuppression. The TB recovery rate in HIV infected patients was similar to the expected rate in non-infected individuals. The best results were obtained when regimens containing rifampicin were used. Pancytopenia and low levels of TCD 4 + and TCD 8 + lymphocytes at the initial time point of the study were correlated with an unfavorable outcome of TB, and therefore they can be considered potential prognostic factors.
