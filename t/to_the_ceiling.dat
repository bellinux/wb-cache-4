5|$|In 1983, Mary discovers Azazel {{standing}} over baby Sam's crib; {{he had been}} feeding his blood to the infant. Upon being interrupted, the demon pins her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> slashes her stomach and causes her to burst into flames. Her death inspires John to dedicate his life to hunting down Azazel, {{at the same time}} training Sam and Dean to hunt supernatural creatures.|$|E
5|$|Central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{decoration}} {{are nine}} {{scenes from the}} Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E
5|$|Dean deduces John's {{message was}} {{coordinates}} {{to where he}} has headed. Sam still {{does not want to}} join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E

50|$|A {{concealed}} {{fan coil}} unit will typically be installed within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The return air grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> will be ducted <b>to</b> and from <b>the</b> {{fan coil unit}} and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating <b>the</b> grilles <b>to</b> suit <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> layout and/or <b>the</b> partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> void as a return air plenum.|$|R
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling)</b> and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, {{is larger than the}} vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 in Lawrence, Kansas, Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound {{coming from}} her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure {{standing}} over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, John (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean, while the house erupts into flames.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s the mayor's {{office was}} refurbished, a new roof was installed, and new trees were {{planted on the}} grounds. In 1964, the city remodeled the City Council {{chambers}} on {{the second and third}} floors. Part of the work was to install new lighting to allow television broadcasts from the chamber, while other work added drop tiles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> hiding the domed roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, {{in association with the}} Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|The team of restorers {{completed}} {{the first stage}} of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows, from aluminium scaffolding projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved cantilevering a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement {{along the length of the}} building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.|$|E

5|$|To {{give the}} long facade with its two wings of {{contrasting}} architectural styles a uniting, common feature, the third story of oval {{windows of the}} left-hand wings, which was then topped with a Jacobean balustrade was repeated above the Gothic right-hand wing; however, inexplicably the attempt at classical unity was broken by the use castellations instead of a balustrade on the right-hand side. Overall, its length, contrasting styles, high gatehouse and lack of symmetry give the facade a collegiate rather than domestic appearance. The {{focal point of the}} facade, the gatehouse, has multi-faceted turrets at its corners, In 1885, the gatehouse was given a Gothic makeover, which included raising its height and adding the fan vaulting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the passage leading, not to a great base court, as such grandiose architectural feature would suggest, but to a small glazed inner courtyard (the Winter Garden).|$|E
5|$|Underwurlde is a {{platform}} game viewed from a side-angle perspective. The player controls Sabreman, a pith-helmeted adventurer, as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its underground caverns {{to find a}} way to escape past the exit guardians. Sabreman must use a specific weapon—knife, dagger, and torch—that corresponds to each guardian. The player uses the keyboard's QWERT keys to progress through a series of flip screens in which the player's character reaches the boundary of the viewable area on the screen to flip to another area, with 597 screens in all. While Sabreman begins in a castle adorned with clocks, birds, and baskets, the character must also descend down into caverns through several successive vertical screens. Sabreman automatically attaches a rope <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> when the player controls him off of a ledge. The player can then swing Sabreman side to side to jump to another ledge. At the bottom of a cavern, Sabreman can ride a bubble to the top.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
25|$|The vestry {{was added}} in 1880, with the screens {{and a new}} altar, {{as well as new}} {{decoration}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of <b>the</b> chancel and sanctuary, being completed in 1890 to designs by J D Sedding. In 1921, a rood was added atop the chancel screen in memory of those men of the parish who had lost their lives in the First World War. A commemorative plaque recording this event and the names of the men who died is placed south of the pulpit.|$|R
25|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the castle}} was {{included}} in the Special Protection Zone and non aedificandi zone, which was later revoked in 1962. The following year, repairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum <b>ceiling</b> and other dependencies of the castle, construction of the roadway around the castle and a staircase <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower keep terrace was undertaken. Other repairs continued in 1962, that included <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls, <b>ceilings</b> and gates. This projects conditioned in the successive years with projects to clean, reinforce and repair the walls and other aspects of the fortification.|$|R

5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} incident, the Army {{considered}} court-martialling several {{officers of the}} 157th Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the Holocaust. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to gas chambers they found naked bodies piled from the floor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. Some of the victims apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers' senses. Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands. Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and that very few were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.|$|E
50|$|A {{mono-pitched roof}} {{can also be}} a smaller {{addition}} to an existing roof, where keeping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same slope (roof pitch) puts the mono-pitched roof lower than <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> height of <b>the</b> main structure. In this case even though the main roof has a flat <b>ceiling,</b> <b>the</b> mono-pitched part will have a sloping, or raked, <b>ceiling</b> line <b>to</b> maximise <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> height. <b>The</b> name lean-to roof comes from this form of addition.|$|R
40|$|Upward {{motion of}} a balcony spill plume in an atrium with a thermal {{stratified}} layer will be simulated.

40|$|With ageing populations, OECD {{governments are}} searching for {{policies}} to increase retirement saving. In April 2001, the UK government introduced Stakeholder Pensions – a low cost retirement saving vehicle – targeted primarily on middle earners with no occupational pension. The reform also changed the structure of tax-relieved contribution ceilings, increasing their generosity for many individuals. We {{examine the impact of}} these reforms on private pension coverage using individual level micro data and a modified difference-of-differences estimator that allows for the discrete outcome variable. The results suggest that <b>the</b> change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> rather than <b>the</b> targeting of benefits, affected private pension coverage rates...|$|R
