5|$|The first {{effective}} {{polio vaccine}} {{was developed in}} 1952 by Jonas Salk and a team at the University of Pittsburgh that included Julius Youngner, Byron Bennett, L.

Salk went on CBS radio <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> successful test on {{a small group of}} adults and children on 26 March 1953; two days later the results were published in JAMA. Beginning 23 February 1954, the vaccine was tested at Arsenal Elementary School and the Watson Home for Children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> ratio of around five Japanese killed {{for every one}} Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> high rate of success {{for the use of}} direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the {{depression}} moved west-northwestward between {{the islands of}} St. Vincent and St. Lucia {{under the influence of}} a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained very poorly organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph (119km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph (95km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155mi (250km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|Babe {{returns to}} the Vic, but is {{rejected}} by Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and leaves. When Stan loses {{the use of his}} legs due to his prostate cancer, Tina asks Babe to visit so she can persuade him to seek medical help. Stan is pleased to see Babe and reconciles with Tina. Although Babe is upset when Stan proposes to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), she encourages Cora to accept the proposal as Stan will never love her. After Stan's death, Babe excludes Cora from his funeral and encourages the rift between Mick and Shirley. After the funeral, Babe tells Sylvie, who is residing in a care home, that Stan has died, which frustrates Sylvie as she could not attend the funeral. Babe and Sylvie argue and exchange insults, leading to Babe slapping Sylvie. Sylvie then bites Babe's shoulder and threatens <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> criminal act that Babe and Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell) committed several years earlier. Babe continues to create a rift between the Carter family and pays a teenager to throw a brick through the window of Shirley's son Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) salon. However, Dean's father, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), learns the truth behind the attack and confronts Babe in front of the Carters, tipping a trifle over her head. After realising Babe's deceit, Mick and Shirley force Babe to leave Walford, but Babe warns that she will return.|$|E
5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began <b>to</b> <b>report</b> <b>a</b> much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest wind measurement associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E
