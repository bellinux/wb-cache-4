5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
25|$|The rat's tail babiana (Babiana ringens) is {{a species}} of plant that {{produces}} a strong stalk within the inflorescence {{that serves as a}} perch for the malachite sunbird as it visits the flower. Heliconias have special sticky threads that help in the adhesion of pollen to smooth structures such as the bill of a hummingbird. Some African orchids of the genus Disa have pollinaria <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to the feet of visiting sunbirds.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of modern}} {{buildings}} <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> more faithfully {{to the ancient}} rectangular temple form are only found from the 18th century onwards. Versions of the Roman temple as a discrete block include La Madeleine, Paris (1807), now a church but built by Napoleon as a Temple de la Gloire de la Grande Armée ("Temple to the Glory of the Great Army"), the Virginia State Capitol as originally built in 1785–88, and Birmingham Town Hall (1832–34).|$|E

500|$|Various {{species of}} Taenia infest {{the guts of}} humans, cats and dogs. The juveniles use herbivores – for example pigs, cattle and rabbits – as {{intermediate}} hosts. Excreted proglottids release eggs <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to grass leaves and hatch after being swallowed by a herbivore. The larva makes {{its way to the}} herbivore's muscles and metamorphoses into an oval worm about [...] long, with a scolex that is kept inside. When the definitive host eats infested and raw or undercooked meat from an intermediate host, the worm's scolex pops out and attaches itself to the gut, and the adult tapeworm develops.|$|E
500|$|Some species form {{aggregates}} or filaments {{of cells}} up to 200μm long. These organisms can be prominent in biofilms. Notably, aggregates of Thermococcus coalescens cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells. Archaea in the genus Pyrodictium produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long, thin hollow tubes called cannulae <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> {{out from the}} cells' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush-like agglomeration. The function of these cannulae is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors. Multi-species colonies exist, such as the [...] "string-of-pearls" [...] community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp. Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to [...] long; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species.|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E

500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{commented that}} the {{prevalent}} use of Auto-Tune on Kesha's vocals {{made it difficult to}} tell if she could actually sing, citing the song [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of [...] "how easily individuality can get lost in a sea of Auto-Tune". On the other hand, Herrera was impressed with the [...] "choruses <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> with the listener for days." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic was not impressed with the album's ballads, calling them [...] "completely unsatisfying." [...] However, he noted [...] "that with so many fun, 'Tik Tok'-type tracks, the album has plenty for both brats and the bratty at heart." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe believed that Kesha's [...] "personality is completely missing from ," [...] resulting in her sounding [...] "vapid and faceless." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was extremely critical of the album and Kesha, saying that her attempts to sing and rap were [...] "pitiful", describing her as [...] "insincere" [...] and [...] "souless". Dave Simpson of The Guardian also questioned the honesty of her lyrics while comparing her unfavorably to Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears.|$|E
2500|$|A toy called [...] "Bindeez" [...] ("Aqua Dots" [...] in North America) was {{recalled}} by {{the distributor}} in November 2007 {{because of the}} presence of 1,4-butanediol. The toy consists of small beads <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to each other by sprinkling water. 1,4-Butanediol was detected by GC-MS. The production plant seems to have intended to cut costs by replacing less toxic 1,5-pentanediol with 1,4-butanediol. ChemNet China listed the price of 1,4 butanediol at between about US$1,350–2,800 per metric ton, while the price for 1,5-pentanediol is about US$9,700 per metric ton.|$|E

2500|$|Most fMRI {{scanners}} allow {{subjects to}} be presented with different visual images, sounds and touch stimuli, and to make different actions such as pressing a button or moving a joystick. Consequently, fMRI {{can be used to}} reveal brain structures and processes associated with perception, thought and action. The resolution of fMRI is about 2-3 millimeters at present, limited by the spatial spread of the hemodynamic response to neural activity. It has largely superseded PET for the study of brain activation patterns. PET, however, retains the significant advantage of being able to identify specific brain receptors (or transporters) associated with particular neurotransmitters through its ability to image radiolabelled receptor [...] "ligands" [...] (receptor ligands are any chemicals <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to receptors).|$|E
2500|$|Michael Wildes from The Christian Manifesto lavished praise {{upon the}} album's unorthodox {{production}} and theologically deep, highly skilled lyricism. He wrote that [...] "it's {{hard to talk}} about such a creative album and do it the justice it deserves", and commented of the album's production that [...] "Talking about organic, your mother's favorite gardening tools can be heard making rhythms and beats on this number." [...] Christian Music Zine's Anthony Peronto praised the chemistry and group dynamic between Beautiful Eulogy's three members. He concluded that With nary a flaw to be found and undeniable growth by each member, Beautiful Eulogy have exceeded all expectations and delivered their best work yet. Though I want to resist repeating my thoughts on Beautiful Eulogy's debut album I can't say {{it any other way}} than this slight paraphrasing: This is the most musically creative hip hop album I've heard since, well... Satellite Kite. Jessica Cooper of Indie Vision Music summarized that All of Instruments of Mercy is fresh in sound, featuring loops of new beats and sounds <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> to the lyrics like glue. Beautiful Eulogy continues to be consistent in their collaborative works and are undoubtedly blessed with the words and musical talent to produce something that's cohesive, poetic, and undeniably beautiful from beginning to end. Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice praised the rapping skills of Odd Thomas and Braille, Courtland Urbano's production, and the lyrical focus of the album. He remarked that [...] "It is hard not to marvel at the sheer talent of these three individuals, whether it is in the crisp vocals, wonderful production, or the dense and theologically provoking lyrics." ...|$|E
