5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy's tribes located {{north of}} the Forth-Clyde isthmus include the Cornovii in Caithness, the Caereni, Smertae, Carnonacae, Decantae, Lugi and Creones also {{north of the}} Great Glen, the Taexali in the north-east, the Epidii in Argyll, the Venicones in Fife, the Caledonians in the central Highlands and the Vacomagi centred near Strathmore. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{cultures}} spoke a form of Celtic language known as Pritennic. The occupants of southern Scotland were the Damnonii in the Clyde valley, the Novantae in Galloway, the Selgovae on the south coast and the Votadini to the east. These peoples may have spoken a form of Brythonic language.|$|E

25|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of the Irish Labourers Act (1883) to pursue a plan to have all cabins demolished and replaced by a modern housing scheme. In all of these enterprises, Sheehan could count on the support of Lord Castletown of Upper Ossory (Bernard Edward Barnaby FitzPatrick, 2nd Baron Castletown), who had married Lord Doneraile's only child, the Honourable Emily Ursula Clare St. Leger. Perhaps it is not completely coincidental <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> social projects are ruminated on by Sheehan's fictional Parish Priest in, what was perhaps his most successful novel, My New Curate.|$|E
25|$|In the past, remains {{have been}} {{attributed}} to the same genus as the Judith River Troodon {{from a wide variety of}} other geological formations.

Further study and more fossils are needed to determine how many species of Troodon existed. It is questionable that, after further study, any additional species can be referred to Troodon, in which case the genus would be considered a nomen dubium.|$|E

25|$|Early on, some Hitler pathographies took {{not only}} psychological, but also {{historical}} and sociological aspects into account. This interdisciplinary approach {{had been developed}} by the psychiatrist Wilhelm Lange-Eichbaum back in 1928. The earliest socio-psychological pathography of Hitler appeared in 1948 in Gustav Bychowski anthology Dictators and Disciples. In this volume, Bychowski, a Polish-American psychiatrist, compared several historical figures who have successfully carried out a coup d’etat: Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, Robespierre, Hitler and Josef Stalin. He {{came to the conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> men had an abundance of traits that must by classified as “psychopathic” such as the tendency to act out impulses or to project their own hostile impulses onto other people or groups.|$|E
25|$|According to the Kirpal Report, 105 {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} flight at Mirabel Airport while 202 passengers who traveled on Flight 182 had boarded Flight 181 at Toronto Pearson Airport. The report stated that interlining passengers boarding Flight 181 in Toronto who became passengers on Flight 182 included 10 passengers connecting from Vancouver, 5 passengers from Winnipeg, 4 passengers from Edmonton, and 2 passengers from Saskatoon. It stated <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> passengers had taken flights on Air Canada, and no interlining passengers boarded Flight 182 in Montreal. In the documentary Air India 182 Renée Sarojini Saklikar stated that her {{aunt and uncle}} had taken a CP Air flight from Vancouver to connect to AI182; the two were on AI182 while it was in Montreal. The flight crew and cabin crew of Flight 182 had boarded in Toronto and commanded the segment of Flight 181 from Toronto to Montreal.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} mathematicians to work with {{different}} types of cohomology was Georges de Rham. One can use the differential structure of smooth manifolds via de Rham cohomology, or Čech or sheaf cohomology to investigate the solvability of differential equations defined on the manifold in question. De Rham showed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> approaches were interrelated and that, for a closed, oriented manifold, the Betti numbers derived through simplicial homology were the same Betti numbers as those derived through de Rham cohomology. This was extended in the 1950s, when Eilenberg and Steenrod generalized this approach. They defined homology and cohomology as functors equipped with natural transformations subject to certain axioms (e.g., a weak equivalence of spaces passes to an isomorphism of homology groups), verified that all existing (co)homology theories satisfied these axioms, and then proved that such an axiomatization uniquely characterized the theory.|$|E

25|$|Catherine Hills {{suggests}} {{it is not}} necessary to see all the early settlers as federate troops, and that this interpretation has been used rather too readily by some archaeologists. A variety of relationships could have existed between Romano-British and incoming Anglo-Saxons. The broader archaeological picture suggests that no one model will explain all the Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain and that there was considerable regional variation. Settlement density varied within southern and eastern England. Norfolk has more large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries than the neighbouring East Anglian county of Suffolk; eastern Yorkshire (the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira) far more than the rest of Northumbria. The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, but we should not assume <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later Viking settlers, may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.|$|E
25|$|Proper use {{of these}} gas {{relationships}} requires the Kinetic-molecular theory (KMT). When gas particles possess a magnetic charge or Intermolecular force they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In {{the absence of any}} charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. Notice <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see fluid dynamics).|$|E
25|$|All of the {{earliest}} traditional Clan Mackenzie histories claim descent from a Fitzgerald progenitor. These histories include those by John Mackenzie of Applecross (died c.1684/5), George Mackenzie first Earl of Cromarty (died 1714) and the unpublished Letterfearn, Ardintoul and Allangrange manuscripts. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> histories ultimately derive from a single manuscript created by William MacQueen, Parson of Assynt in 1576, now lost. Alexander Mackenzie followed the Fitzgerald scheme for {{the first edition of}} his History of the Mackenzies in 1879, but abandoned it in his later 1894 edition based on the intervening publication of genealogies contained in MS 1467. MS 1476 was compiled 200 years before {{the earliest}} surviving Mackenzie traditional history. The Mackenzie and Matheson genealogies in MS 1467, which end c.1400, both derive from a Gilleoin of the Aird, but make no mention of Fitzgerald. The genealogies in MS 1467 have been interpreted as in part a census of the military resources available to Domhnall lord of the Isles in a period when he was seeking to make good his wife's claims to the earldom of Ross, culminating in the battle of Harlaw in 1411. Based on MS 1467 and a series of charters associated with Beauly Priory, {{it has been suggested that}} the Mackenzies and Mathesons were junior branches of the Del Ard family, heirs to Gilleoin of the Aird. The senior line of this family, prominent in the 13th and 14th centuries, terminated in the heiress Margaret del Ard, the Lady of Erchless, who married Alexander Chisolm of Cromer c.1350.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before 5 September 2007, Licciardello, who {{was dressed}} as a police officer, {{performed}} random security checks and procedures on {{members of the public}} to demonstrate the glorification of the tough APEC security measures. These procedures included random frisking, taking hair samples, telling tram riders in Melbourne to stand and turn their heads, and erecting secure areas in public toilets and near escalators. When Licciardello was approached by real security officers, he said <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> measures were [...] "classified".

While the PlayStation 3 version suffered from minor framerate and loading time issues as well as reduced graphical fidelity, reviewers observed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> problems were eliminated in the PlayStation 4 version, creating parity with the PC release. Kollar and Leif Johnson of IGN also found that the game played admirably on PlayStation Vita via Remote Play with only minor lag.|$|E

500|$|The Latin {{tradition}} {{consists of}} three authors writing in the later 4th and early 5th centuries—Jerome, Orosius, and Vincent of Lérins. The tradition is represented in Jerome's Liber de viris inlustribus and Chronicon, Orosius' Historiarum Adversum Paganos, and Vincent of Lérins' Commonitorum Primum. Most scholars hold <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia. These authors follow the Greek tradition, and probably takes all of their information from Eusebius, Eusebius' sources, or Jerome. These authors are more forceful in their claims than Eusebius, as demonstrated by their use of primus, or [...] "first", as in [...] "first Christian emperor", when referring to Philip. Jerome is the most important, both since he is the earliest of the three, and because, as the editor and translator of Eusebius' Chronicon (Chronicle), he is closest to Eusebius.|$|E
500|$|Cobb {{has also}} been active in formulating his own {{theories}} of religious pluralism, partly in response to another Claremont Graduate University professor, John Hick. [...] Cobb's pluralism has sometimes {{been identified as a}} kind of [...] "deep" [...] pluralism or, alternately, as a [...] "complementary" [...] pluralism. [...] He believes that there are actually three distinct religious ultimates: 1) God, 2) Creativity/Emptiness/Nothingness/Being-itself, and 3) the cosmos/universe. [...] Cobb believes <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> elements are necessary and present in some form in every religion but that different faiths tend to stress one ultimate over the others. [...] Viewed in this way, different religions may be seen to complement each other by providing insight into different religious ultimates. [...] Cobb's pluralism thus avoids the criticism of conflating religions that are actually very different (for instance, Buddhism and Christianity) while still affirming the possible truths of both.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of Washington {{has focused}} on the {{decision}} in the broader context of procedural trial rights. A 2007 article in the Georgetown Law Review by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision. Hewett's main criticism was based on the Court's lack of a standard on which to evaluate whether certain evidence was [...] "material" [...] to a defendant's case. Hewett noted that in a post-Washington decision in 1973, the Court applied a [...] "case-specific" [...] decision rather than a [...] "general constitutional standard". This line of decisions, Hewett argued, led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the [...] "actual reliability of the evidence" [...] in cases where a witness is not present. The [...] "newly-seized power" [...] was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed. This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the [...] "situations [...] the reliability of the excluded evidence [...] could factfinder". Hewett concluded by arguing <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cases had diminished the protections of the jury and of the defendant's right to have his own defense.|$|E
