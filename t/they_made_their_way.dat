5|$|Back in Egypt, {{and after}} {{a short period of}} rest, Kippenberger set about {{rebuilding}} the battalion, which had lost over half its original complement. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers continued to arrive for several weeks as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Mediterranean in small sailboats. By mid-June, it was back up to strength. Several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Agârbiceanu and {{his family}} found shelter with a Transylvanian family in Borogani village, near Leova in Bessarabia. The October Revolution soon broke out, and <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to Moldavia, where he became a {{military}} chaplain for the Hârlău-based Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia. He returned to Orlat in December 1918. In March 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania, he was named director of Patria newspaper, which was edited by the province's Directing Council.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> far inland, but {{a wide variety of}} other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E

5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to the dressing room.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} that there was any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E

5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|The 20th Battalion was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, {{having lost}} over half its original complement of personnel during the Greece and Crete campaigns. After {{a short period}} of rest, Kippenberger set about bringing the battalion back up to strength. Nearly 400 replacements joined the battalion and stragglers, separated from the battalion for various reasons during the previous two months while in Greece and Crete, continued to arrive for several weeks as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Mediterranean by various means, including small sailboats. By mid-June, the battalion was at full strength and several weeks were spent at the battalion's previous positions at Baggush, engaged in intensive desert training.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{entered the}} village by 16:30. Lieutenant Colonel Borislav Đukić, {{in command of}} the Tactical Group-1 tasked with capture of Kijevo and the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 221st Motorised Infantry Brigade, reported that the village was secured by 22:30. The Croatian police fled Kijevo in three groups via Mount Kozjak towards Drniš. The remaining Croatian population left after the artillery had destroyed much of their settlements. The retreating groups were pursued by the Yugoslav Air Force jets as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> across the Kozjak. Radio Television Belgrade reporter Vesna Jugović recorded these events. Krajina units commanded by Martić acted in concert with JNA to take command of the area.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the advance}} party of the Alsos Mission moved to Normandy in August 1944, where it joined T-Force, a similar {{formation}} to S-Force, at Rambouillet, where it was preparing for the liberation of Paris. An Alsos Mission team including Pash and Calvert reached Joliot-Curie's house in the Paris suburbs on 24 August to find {{that he was not}} there, but at his laboratory at the Collège de France. The next day they reached the Porte d'Orléans where they encountered troops of the French 2e Division Blindée, who were engaged in liberating the city, and came under small arms fire from the German defenders. The Alsos Mission replied with their M1 carbines and Thompson submachine guns as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> through the back streets to the college, where they found Joliot-Curie in his office.|$|E
5|$|The {{successes of}} Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav partisans in Dalmatia led the Allies to {{despatch}} small patrols into Yugoslavia and Albania to contact partisan leaders and arrange co-operation with the Allied air forces. Several Rhodesian patrols from the LRDG {{were selected to}} undertake such missions during August and September 1944. Yugoslav partisans subsequently indicated targets for Allied bombing missions, with some success. From September, members of the LRDG's Rhodesian squadron under Captain Olivey undertook advanced reconnaissance in the Peloponnese peninsula of southern Greece. Landing at Katakolo, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> inland to Corinth and, along with the British 4th Parachute Battalion, entered Athens as the Germans departed in November. The Rhodesians of the LRDG spent November and December helping Greek forces to garrison an Athens orphanage against supporters of the communist Greek People's Liberation Army. Four Rhodesians were killed.|$|E
5|$|When living {{conditions}} deteriorated, Gershkovitch traveled to Chita and obtained permission to visit Vladivostok via Manchuria. After {{crossing the border}} to China in 1921, he remained in Harbin, where he met Lucia, who had also escaped from Russia. Together <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Tientsin, where they met and became close friends with composer Aaron Avshalomov. When ballerina Anna Pavlova heard that Gershkovitch had escaped from Russia, she offered him a position as assistant conductor with her orchestra, which was touring throughout Asia. Following three months of touring, Gershkovitch settled in Tokyo to undertake the newly organized Tokyo Symphony Orchestra under the patronage of Baron Okura, a wealthy nobleman and relative of the Mikado.|$|E
60|$|The raft {{was again}} brought into requisition, {{and it was}} found that it could carry twelve men. Dimchurch and nine others were chosen, and, using oars as paddles, <b>they</b> slowly <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> down to the spot.|$|R
60|$|By noon <b>they</b> had <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> {{directly}} {{through the woods}} and had eleven rabbits and three squirrels to their credit. Then Tom suggested they build a campfire and rest while eating their lunch and this was done.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> now <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> {{along the}} rock {{back to the}} shore, and then hurried to the village. There they learned that six men had succeeded in getting to shore along the rope, before the vessel broke up.|$|R
5|$|On {{the deserted}} island with the {{surviving}} crew, Judy {{managed to find}} a fresh water source saving them all. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to Singkep in the Dutch East Indies and afterwards to Sumatra aiming to link up with the evacuating British forces. After trekking across 200 miles of jungle for five weeks, during which Judy survived an attack from a crocodile, the crew arrived {{a day after the}} final vessel had left and subsequently became prisoners of war of the Japanese. She was eventually smuggled into the Medan camp, where she met Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams for the first time, who she would go on {{to spend the rest of}} her life with. Williams convinced the camp Commandant to register her as an official prisoner of war, with the number '81A Gloergoer Medan'. She was the only dog to be registered as a prisoner of war during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to her house, where Lotso found {{that he had been}} replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, with Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
5000|$|Some modern-day {{writers have}} {{described}} the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all, and according to one journalist, [...] "Their crimes were so shocking that <b>they</b> never <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into bushranger folklore — people just wanted to forget about them." ...|$|R

25|$|Zúñiga's party {{arrived at}} the mission on 18 July 1781. Because they had arrived with smallpox, they were {{immediately}} quarantined {{a short distance away}} from the mission.

25|$|In 1537, {{during the}} Third Ottoman–Venetian War, Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent {{dispatched}} {{a force of}} 25,000 men {{under the command of}} admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa to attack Corfu. The Ottomans landed at Govino Bay, present day Gouvia, and proceeded toward Corfu town, destroying the village of Potamos as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> toward the City.|$|E
25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks batted {{first at}} Bristol. Two quick wickets reduced them to 14 for 2. It {{was a slow}} pitch that was not conducive to a high score, but <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to 202 for 7 off their 45 overs, {{thanks in part to}} Damien Wright smashing three sixes in four balls in the {{penultimate}} over, and thanks to Gloucestershire Gladiators dropping three catches.|$|E
