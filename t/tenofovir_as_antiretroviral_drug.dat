Visceral adiposity is commonly associated with metabolic abnormalities including low HDL- cholesterol, raised triglycerides, insulin resistance and hypertension, a constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus known as the metabolic syndrome. Medline and conference abstracts were searched to identify clinical research on factors associated with visceral adiposity and randomized studies of management approaches. Data were critically reviewed by physicians familiar with the field. A range of host and lifestyle factors, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> choice, were associated with increased visceral adiposity. Management approaches included treatment switching. Supraphysiological doses of recombinant HGH and the hGHRH tesamorelin both significantly and selectively reduce visceral fat over 12 - 24 weeks; however, the benefits are only maintained if dosing is continued. In summary, the prevention and management of visceral adiposity remains a substantial challenge in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the first inhibitors of HIV replication, drug resistance has been a major problem in HIV therapy, due, in part, to the high mutation rate of HIV. Therefore, the development of a predictive animal model is important to identify impending resistance mutations and to possibly inform treatment decisions. Significant advances have been made possible through use of nonhuman primates infected by SIV, SHIV, and stHIV- 1, and use of humanized mouse models of HIV- 1 infections. In this review, we describe some of the findings from animal models used for the preclinical testing of integrase strand transfer inhibitors as well <b>as</b> other <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> These models have led to important findings about the potential role of integrase strand transfer inhibitors in both the prevention and treatment of HIV- 1 infection...|$|R

40|$|Integrase inhibitors are a {{class of}} <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> used for the {{treatment}} of AIDS that target HIV integrase, an enzyme responsible for integration of viral cDNA into host genome. RAG 1, a critical enzyme involved in V(D) J recombination exhibits structural similarity to HIV integrase. We find that two integrase inhibitors, Raltegravir and Elvitegravir, interfered with the physiological functions of RAGs such as binding, cleavage and hairpin formation at the recombination signal sequence (RSS), though the effect of Raltegravir was limited. Circular dichroism studies demonstrated a distinct change in the secondary structure of RAG 1 central domain (RAG 1 shares DDE motif amino acids with integrases), and when incubated with Elvitegravir, an equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 32. 53 +/- 2. 9 mu M was determined by Biolayer interferometry, leading to inhibition of its binding to DNA. Besides, using extrachromosomal assays, we show that Elvitegravir inhibited both coding and signal joint formation in pre-B cells. Importantly, treatment with Elvitegravir resulted in significant reduction of mature B lymphocytes in 70 % of mice studied.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{maturation}} inhibitor bevirimat (BVM) potently inhibits {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication by blocking capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-SP 1) cleavage. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that {{a significant proportion of}} HIV- 1 -infected patients do not respond to BVM. A patient's failure to respond correlated with baseline polymorphisms at SP 1 residues 6 - 8. Results In this study, we demonstrate that varying levels of BVM resistance are associated with point mutations at these residues. BVM susceptibility was maintained by SP 1 -Q 6 A, -Q 6 H and -T 8 A mutations. However, an SP 1 -V 7 A mutation conferred high-level BVM resistance, and SP 1 -V 7 M and T 8 Δ mutations conferred intermediate levels of BVM resistance.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} retroviruses, {{productive}} infection with HIM requires three key {{steps in the}} viral replication: (i) reverse transcription of viral genomic RNA into viral cDNA by the viral reverse transcriptase; (ii) integration of viral cDNA into host cell genome using the viral integrase; and (iii) cleavage of newly synthesized viral polypeptide by the viral protease into individual viral proteins during new virion assembly. Following their discovery, all three viral enzymes were considered <b>as</b> targets for <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, while multiple reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors {{have been used for}} more than 12 years to treat HIV-infected individuals, only recently has the viral integrase enzyme emerged as an alternative, clinically validated target to block HIM replication.

40|$|Publicación ISIWe {{review the}} {{evidence}} on effectiveness of interventions for the treatment and prevention of selected mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries. Depression can be treated effectively in such countries with low-cost antidepressants or with psychological interventions (such as cognitive-behaviour therapy and interpersonal therapies). Stepped-care and collaborative models {{provide a framework for}} integration of drug and psychological treatments and help to improve rates of adherence to treatment. First-generation antipsychotic drugs are effective and cost effective for the treatment of schizophrenia; their benefits can be enhanced by psychosocial treatments, such as community-based models of care. Brief interventions delivered by primary-care professionals are effective for management of hazardous alcohol use, and pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have some benefits for people with alcohol dependence. Policies designed to reduce consumption, such as increased taxes and other control strategies, can reduce the population burden of alcohol abuse. Evidence about the efficacy of interventions for developmental disabilities is inadequate, but community-based rehabilitation models provide a low-cost, integrative framework for care of children and adults with chronic mental disabilities. Evidence for mental health interventions for people who are exposed to conflict and other disasters is still weak-especially for interventions in the midst of emergencies. Some trials of interventions for prevention of depression and developmental delays in low-income and middle-income countries show beneficial effects. Interventions for depression, delivered in primary care, are as cost effective <b>as</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> for HIV/AIDS. The process and effectiveness of scaling up mental health interventions has not been adequately assessed. Such research is needed to inform the continuing process of service reform and innovation.

40|$|Worldwide, {{tuberculosis}} is {{the most}} common opportunistic infection among people with HIV infection. In addition to its frequency, tuberculosis is also associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the complexities of treating two infections requiring multidrug therapy at the same time, antiretroviral therapy can be life-saving among patients with tuberculosis and advanced HIV disease. Observational studies {{in a variety of settings}} have shown that use of antiretroviral therapy during tuberculosis treatment results in marked decreases in the risk of death or other opportunistic infections among persons with tuberculosis and advanced HIV disease. Concomitant use of treatment for tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapy is complicated by the adherence challenge of polypharmacy, overlapping side effect profi es of antituberculosis <b>drugs</b> and <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and drug-drug interactions. The key interactions, and the focus of this document, are those between the rifamycin antibiotics and four classes of antiretroviral drugs: protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTI], CCR 5 -receptor antagonists, and integrase inhibitors. Only two of the currently available <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> classes, the nucleoside analogues (other than zidovudine) and enfuvirtide (a parenteral entry inhibitor) do not have significant interactions with the rifamycins. The purpose of this summary is to provide the clinician with updated recommendations for managing the drug-drug interactions that occur when using antiretroviral therapy during tuberculosis treatment. Changes from previous versions of these guidelines include: an effort to obtain and summarize the clinical experience of using specific antiretroviral regimens during tuberculosis treatment (not just pharmacokinetic data), a table summarizing the clinical experience with key antiretroviral regimens and providing recommended regimens (Table 1), and sections on treatment for special populations (young children, pregnant women, patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis).

40|$|HIV-associated neurocognitive {{disorder}} (HAND) {{describes a}} wide range of cognitive impairments experienced by up to 55 % of HIV+ individuals despite viral suppression by combined antiretroviral therapy. Reasons for the persistence of this disease are unknown, but may be related to both the presence of HIV-infected macrophages in the central nervous system as well <b>as</b> neurotoxicity of <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> In this thesis, we identified two independent mechanisms of HIV-associated and antiretroviral-associated toxicity that may each contribute distinctly to HAND neuropathogenesis. First, we showed that β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1), which {{may play a role in}} the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease, was both increased in HIV+ patient brains and required for HIV-associated neurotoxicity in vitro. The BACE 1 cleavage target amyloid precursor protein (APP) also mediated toxicity and was required for neuroprotective effects of BACE 1 inhibition. Second, we showed that two frontline treatment <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> have neurotoxic potential in vitro and that neurotoxicity of antiretrovirals is highly variable both across and within drug classes. Neurotoxicity of one drug, lopinavir, was mediated by oxidative stress. Taken together, these data indicate that HIV and antiretrovirals may contribute to HAND persistence and that both BACE 1 inhibitors and drugs targeting oxidative stress may be effective as adjunctive therapeutics in HIV+ patients. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), {{there has been a}} dramatic improvement in the prognosis of people living with HIV. Indeed, data from numerous cohorts now show that for people commenced on ART at high CD 4 counts and who are retained in care, life expectancy is similar to matched HIV-negative people. Consequently, the number of years an individual diagnosed with HIV can expect to be treated with ART is set to increase markedly. With the emergence of an older population, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions are now more prominent clinical problems in the management of HIV. Furthermore, as the number of years an individual spends on ART increases, treatment fatigue leading to suboptimal adherence and antiretroviral resistance are frequently observed. As such, the development of long-acting parenteral <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> with low propensity for drug-drug interactions, low toxicity and high genetic barriers to resistance is highly desirable. Fusion inhibitors are a class of <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> which display limited systemic toxicities and few drug-drug interactions. They are rarely used, however, owing to injection site reactions associated with their delivery. C 34 -PEG 4 -Chol is a novel fusion inhibitor derived from the lead molecule, C 34, but modified with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cholesterol (Chol). With addition of cholesterol, potency of the drug is enhanced by concentrating it in cell membrane domains where viral fusion occurs. Moreover, the addition of cholesterol has been shown to markedly enhance its circulatory half-life in rodents such that it may potentially act <b>as</b> a long-acting <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> in humans with infrequent subcutaneous injections. In this thesis, I assess the antiretroviral resistance pattern of C 34 -PEG 4 -Chol in vitro. An adaptive clinical trial design was simulated to examine options of optimising the output of useful pharmacokinetic data after administration of single doses of C 34 -PEG 4 -Chol to HIV-positive men. Finally, I undertook a ‘first-in-man’ study to examine the pharmacokinetic profile of C 34 -PEG 4 -Chol and potential of this agent <b>as</b> a long-acting <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug.</b> My work demonstrates the emergence of mutations to C 34 -PEG 4 -Chol via novel pathways within the heptad repeat (HR) - 1 domains of gp 41. Compensatory mutations were also observed within the HR- 2 domain. The phenotypic effect of a HR- 1 mutation was demonstrated following generation of mutant viral clones and assessing viral entry into cells in the presence of drug. An adaptive clinical trial design has shown, through simulations, to lead to more efficient allocation of trial participants across potentially therapeutic doses of the drug.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMany ways of {{preventing}} HIV infection {{have been proposed}} and more are being developed. We sought to construct a strategic approach to HIV prevention that would use limited resources to achieve the greatest possible prevention impact {{through the use of}} interventions available today and in the coming years. MethodsWe developed a deterministic compartmental model of heterosexual HIV transmission in South Africa and formed assumptions about the costs and effects of a range of interventions, encompassing the further scale-up of existing interventions (promoting condom use, male circumcision, early antiretroviral therapy [ART] initiation for all [including increased HIV testing and counselling activities], and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]), the introduction of new interventions in the medium term (offering intravaginal rings, long-acting injectable <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs)</b> and long term (vaccine, broadly neutralising antibodies [bNAbs]). We examined how available resources could be allocated across these interventions to achieve maximum impact, and assessed how this would be affected by the failure of the interventions to be developed or scaled up. FindingsIf all interventions are available, the optimum mix would place great emphasis on the following: scale-up of male circumcision and early ART initiation with outreach testing, as these are available immediately and assumed to be low cost and highly efficacious; intravaginal rings targeted to sex workers; and vaccines, as these can achieve a large effect if scaled up even if imperfectly efficacious. The optimum mix would rely less on longer term developments, such <b>as</b> long-acting <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> and bNAbs, unless the costs of these reduced. However, if impossible to scale up existing interventions to the extent assumed, emphasis on oral PrEP, intravaginal rings, and long-acting <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> would increase. The long-term effect on the epidemic is most affected by scale-up of existing interventions and the successful development of a vaccine. InterpretationWith current information, a strategic approach in which limited resources are used to maximise prevention impact would focus on strengthening the scale-up of existing interventions, while pursuing a workable vaccine and developing other approaches that can be used if further scale-up of existing interventions is limited.

Many <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> have a low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. Drug formulation can significantly affect bioavailability, and given the increasing number of new formulations and drug combinations, {{it is important to be}} aware that formulation can influence the pharmacokinetics of <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> Areas covered: This review provides an overview of studies assessing the pharmacokinetics of different <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> formulations in adults and children, including fixed-dose combinations. For some <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> differences in pharmacokinetics have been described, with largest differences in exposure when a liquid formulation is compared to a tablet or capsule formulation. Biopharmaceutical properties of <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> relevant to bioavailability are discussed. Expert opinion: <b>Antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> formulations and their excipients can significantly impact drug exposure. However, this is not yet fully recognized. It is important to realize that children use different formulations than adults. Effort should be made to ensure that adequate drug exposures are achieved to treat HIV-infected children. In addition, manipulation of drug formulations may lead to differences in pharmacokinetics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nef is an HIV- 1 {{accessory}} protein {{essential for}} viral replication and AIDS progression. Nef interacts with {{a multitude of}} host cell signaling partners, including members of the Src kinase family. Nef preferentially activates Hck, a Src-family kinase (SFK) strongly expressed in macrophages and other HIV target cells, by binding to its regulatory SH 3 domain. Recently, we identified a series of kinase inhibitors that preferentially inhibit Hck {{in the presence of}} Nef. These compounds also block Nef-dependent HIV replication, validating the Nef-SFK signaling pathway <b>as</b> an <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> target. Our findings also suggested that by binding to the Hck SH 3 domain, Nef indirectly affects the conformation of the kinase active site to favor inhibitor association. Results To test this hypothesis, we engineered a "gatekeeper" mutant of Hck with enhanced sensitivity to the pyrazolopyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitor, NaPP 1. We also modified the RT loop of the Hck SH 3 domain to enhance interaction of the kinase with Nef. This modification stabilized Nef:Hck interaction in solution-based kinase assays, as a way to mimic the more stable association that likely occurs at cellular membranes. Introduction of the modified RT loop rendered Hck remarkably more sensitive to activation by Nef, and led to a significant decrease in the K m for ATP as well as enhanced inhibitor potency. Conclusions These observations suggest that stable interaction with Nef may induce Src-family kinase active site conformations amenable to selective inhibitor targeting. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectrophotometric}} data in {{the interactions}} between the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and blood cells treated with <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> were collected {{to be used to}} show the effects of <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> on the absorbance characteristics of HIV infected and uninfected blood. The methodology involved the serial dilution of the five different <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> (two HAART/FDC and three single drugs) and the subsequent incubation with the blood samples collected from ten HIV infected persons who had not yet commenced treatment with the <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> ten HIV infected persons who had already commenced treatment with the <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> and ten HIV negative persons, for the absorbance measurements using a digital Ultraviolet Visible MetaS-pecAE 1405031 Pro Spectrophotometer. The peak absorbance data for various interacting systems were measured. These were used to show that the <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> had the effect of increasing the peak absorbance values of both the uninfected and infected blood components, i. e., the drugs were made able to increase the light absorption capacity of the blood cells. The use of the finding...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in 1996 has significantly reduced HIV related {{morbidity and mortality}} in the Western world. Recent advances in antiretroviral treatment {{have resulted in a}} life expectancy of effectively treated HIV infected patients, comparable to those having other chron­ic diseases. There is a group of patients that have a slow progression towards AIDS if they are untreated. The presence of a heterozygous 32 nucleotide deletion in one of the CCR 5 co-receptor genes is often seen in these long term non-progressors. This CCR 5 Δ 32 results in a truncated gene product which is not expressed at the cellular surface. Homozygous CCR 5 Δ 32 individuals are healthy and are largely re­sistant to HIV infection. These observations lead to the development of CCR 5 an­tagonists <b>as</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> Maraviroc (MVC) is the first <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> in clinical practice that targets this host chemokine receptor and only inhibits vi­ral entry of CCR 5 using HIV. One important consequence of the administration of CCR 5 antagonists is the risk of selection of viral variants capable of using the alter­native CXCR 4 co-receptor, therefore, co-receptor tropism should be assessed be­fore clinical use of the inhibitor. Furthermore, given the redundancies in the im­mune system, CCR 5 is not critical for normal immune function and CCR 5 based HIV curative strategies are now widely investigated. In this thesis we investigated the effect of inhibiting HIV binding to the CCR 5 co-receptor on HIV treatment, pathogenesis and HIV cure. In a cohort of 63 patients MVC was well tolerated and phenotypic and genotypic assays that asses co-receptor tropism were comparable in predicting clinical outcome of MVC based antiretroviral therapy. Since genotypic tropism prediction was excellent in predicting clinical outcome we advise for practical reasons to perform genotypic tropism tests. Furthermore, independent genotypic tropism testing performed in triplicate slightly increases the detection of minority variants that use CXCR 4 for viral entry. MVC inhibits HIV that uses CCR 5 for viral entry, however the inhibitory effect of MVC on dual-tropic variants was unknown. We investigated the selective pressure and inhibitory effect of MVC in patients infected with a viral population that could use CXCR 4. MVC was able to inhibit part of dual tropic viral populations and MVC selected rapidly for extreme CXCR 4 using variants. MVC therapy intensification was thought to be beneficial for immunological non-responders to cART. We assessed the virological effect of MVC intensification in these patients. We found a significant difference in HIV transcription during MVC intensification in the placebo and MVC group. Currently, only one patient has been declared cured of an HIV infection. We assessed the role of co-receptor tropism in the cure of this patient who received stem cell transplantation with CCR 5 CCR 5 Δ 32 /Δ 32 stem cells. His new cells were fully resistant to the HIV population present prior to stem cell therapy. Our studies performed in this thesis give insight into the effect of CCR 5 inhibition. The antiretroviral strategy of inhibiting CCR 5 was found to {{be a good way to}} inhibit HIV and needs to be further investigated with respect to HIV cure...|$|R
