2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, courts will not {{interpret}} the Preamble <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the government powers {{that are not}} articulated elsewhere in the Constitution. United States v. Kinnebrew Motor Co. {{is an example of}} this. In that case, the defendants were a car manufacturer and dealership indicted for a criminal violation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Congress passed the statute in order to cope with the Great Depression, and one of its provisions <b>purported</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> the President authority to fix [...] "the prices at which new cars may be sold". The dealership, located in Oklahoma City, had sold an automobile to a customer (also from Oklahoma City) for less than the price for new cars fixed pursuant to the Act. Substantively, the case was about whether the transaction in question constituted [...] "interstate commerce" [...] that Congress could regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Although the government argued that the scope of the Commerce Clause included this transaction, it also argued that the Preamble's statement that the Constitution was created to [...] "promote the general Welfare" [...] should be understood to permit Congress to regulate transactions such as the one in this case, particularly {{in the face of an}} obvious national emergency like the Great Depression. The court, however, dismissed this argument as erroneous and insisted that the only relevant issue was whether the transaction that prompted the indictment actually constituted [...] "interstate commerce" [...] under the Supreme Court's precedents that interpreted the scope of the Commerce Clause.|$|R
