5|$|Historians Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, and geographers Pausanias and Strabo, who {{traveled}} throughout the Greek world and noted <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> heard, supplied numerous local myths and legends, often giving little-known alternative versions. Herodotus in particular, searched the various traditions presented him {{and found the}} historical or mythological roots in the confrontation between Greece and the East. Herodotus attempted to reconcile origins and the blending of differing cultural concepts.|$|E

25|$|Unlike sculptures done by his predecessors, these {{focus on}} {{specific}} points of narrative tension in <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> {{are trying to}} tell: Aeneas and his family fleeing the burning Troy; the instant that Pluto finally grasps the hunted Persephone; the precise moment that Apollo sees his beloved Daphne begin her transformation into a tree. They are transitory but dramatic powerful moments in each story. Bernini's David is another stirring example of this. Michelangelo's motionless, idealized David shows the subject holding a rock {{in one hand and}} a sling in the other, contemplating the battle; similarly immobile versions by other Renaissance artists, including Donatello's, show the subject in his triumph after the battle with Goliath. Bernini illustrates David during his active combat with the giant, as he twists his body to catapult toward Goliath. To emphasize these moments, and to ensure that they were appreciated by the viewer, Bernini designed the sculptures with a specific viewpoint in mind. Their original placements within the Villa Borghese were against walls so that the viewers' first view was the dramatic moment of the narrative.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{subject the}} gospels to {{critical}} analysis by differentiating authentic, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations. Since {{there are more}} textual variants in the New Testament (200–400 thousand) than it has letters (c. 140 thousand), scholars use textual criticism to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as 'original'. To answer this question, scholars have to ask who wrote the gospels, when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them, what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars may also look into the internal evidence of the documents, to see if, for example, a document has misquoted texts from the Hebrew Tanakh, has made incorrect claims about geography, if the author appears to have hidden information, or if the author has fabricated a prophecy. Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the testimony of early church leaders, to writers outside the church, primarily Jewish and Greco-Roman historians, {{who would have been}} more likely to have criticized the church, and to archaeological evidence.|$|E

The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille. The second segment {{was written by}} Doyle. The episode's third segment was written by Selman.

500|$|Twenty years {{worth of}} {{research}} had showed that television, a [...] "cultural artifact" [...] accessible to most American children, {{could be a}} [...] "powerful educational agent." [...] The show was designed and produced on the assumption that, since children are cognitively active when they watch television, a show could be an effective method of scientific education for young children by telling stories through pictures and by modeling behavior and learning. The creators and producers used film techniques to present information from multiple perspectives in many [...] "real world" [...] contexts, or situations within the daily experiences of young children. They wanted to provide their viewers with more [...] "authentic learning opportunities" [...] by placing problem-solving tasks within <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement. These learning opportunities included the use of mnemonics {{in the form of}} mantras and songs, and what Tracy called [...] "metacognitive wrap-up" [...] {{at the end of each}} episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed. The producers wanted to foster their audience's sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show's host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.|$|E
500|$|Cuse {{served as}} show runner and head writer. Boam, {{who served as}} {{executive}} producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included John Wirth, Brad Kern, Tom Chehak, David Simkins, and John McNamara. They followed Cuse's informal instruction that {{the tone of the}} show remain [...] "just under over-the-top": the series would be humorous but not too campy. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>they</b> conceived. Worth commented, [...] "there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film. That doesn't always happen." [...] Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of Brisco was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a [...] "student of TV history" [...] while writing for Brisco, reviewing old episodes of Maverick for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a [...] "trans-genre form", because much of the audience grew up with Lethal Weapon, , and The Wild Wild West. Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with Mark Twain's novel Pudd'nhead Wilson. Porter and Porter describe the novel as an [...] "ancestor text", because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it, and say that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in Lost.|$|E
