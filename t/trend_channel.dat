50|$|A trend or price channel can {{be created}} by {{plotting}} a pair of <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> lines {{on either side of}} the market - the first <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> line is the trend line, plus a parallel return line on the other side. Edwards and Magee's return line is also known as the <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> line (singular), confusingly, when only one is mentioned.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> line {{overshoot}} {{refers to}} the price shooting clear out of the observable <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> further {{in the direction of}} the trend. An overshoot does not have to be a reversal bar, since it can occur during a with-trend bar. On occasion it may not result in a reversal at all, it will just force the price action trader to adjust the <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> definition.|$|E

50|$|This {{is a type}} of trend characterised as {{difficult}} to identify and more difficult to trade by Brooks.

50|$|Trend {{channels}} are traded by waiting for break-out failures, i.e. banking on the <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> continuing, {{in which case}} at that bar's close, the entry stop is placed one tick away towards {{the centre of the}} channel above/below the break-out bar. Trading with the break-out only has a good probability of profit when the break-out bar is above average size, and an entry is taken only on confirmation of the break-out. The confirmation would be given when a pull-back from the break-out is over without the pull-back having retraced to the return line, so invalidating the plotted channel lines.|$|E

500|$|At {{least two}} {{sequences}} of basaltic andesite lava flows are deposited south of Tricouni Peak. One of these sequences, known as Tricouni Southwest, creates a cliff {{on the eastern}} side of a north-south <b>trending</b> <b>channel</b> with a depth of [...] adjacent to the High Falls Creek mouth. The eastern flank of the lava flow, outside the High Falls Creek channel, has a more constant structure. Several fine-scale columnar joints and the overall structure of the lava flow suggest that its western portion, {{along the length of the}} channel, ponded against glacial ice. Near its southern unit, lava oozed into cracks in the glacial ice. This has been identified by the existence of spire-like cooling formations, although many of these edifices have been destroyed by erosional processes. Other features that indicate the lava ponded against glacial ice include its unusually thick structure and its steep cliffs. Therefore, the Tricouni Southwest lava flow was erupted about 10,000years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation was retreating. The explanation for the western portion displaying ice-contact features while the eastern portion does not is likely because its western flank lies in a north-south <b>trending</b> <b>channel,</b> which would have been able to maintain smaller amounts of solar heat than its unsheltered eastern flank. As a result, the western portion of the lava flow records glaciation during a period when the eastern slopes were free from glacial ice.|$|R

50|$|If a {{trend line}} is plotted {{on the lower}} lows or the higher highs of a trend over a longer trend, a microtrend line is plotted when all or {{almost all of the}} highs or lows line up in a short multi-bar period. Just as {{break-outs}} from a normal trend are prone to fail as noted above, microtrend lines drawn on a chart are frequently broken by subsequent price action and these break-outs frequently fail too. Such a failure is traded by placing an entry stop order 1 tick above or below the previous bar, which would result in a with-trend position if hit, providing a low risk scalp with a target {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>trend</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the stock}} indices, the common retrace {{of the market}} after a <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> line {{overshoot}} is put down to profit taking and traders reversing their positions. More traders will wait for some reversal price action. The extra surge that causes an overshoot is {{the action of the}} last traders panicking to enter the trend along with increased activity from institutional players who are driving the market and want to see an overshoot as a clear signal that all the previously non-participating players have been dragged in. This is identified by the overshoot bar being a climactic exhaustion bar on high volume. It leaves nobody left to carry on the trend and sets up the price action for a reversal.|$|E
50|$|Classically a {{trend is}} defined {{visually}} by plotting a trend {{line on the}} opposite side of the market from the trend's direction, or by a pair of <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> lines - a trend line plus a parallel return line on the other side - on the chart. These sloping lines reflect the direction of the trend and connect the highest highs or the lowest lows of the trend. In its idealised form, a trend will consist of trending higher highs or lower lows and in a rally, the higher highs alternate with higher lows as the market moves up, and in a sell-off the sequence of lower highs (forming the trendline) alternating with lower lows forms as the market falls. A swing in a rally is a period of gain ending at a higher high (aka swing high), followed by a pull-back ending at a higher low (higher than the start of the swing). The opposite applies in sell-offs, each swing having a swing low at the lowest point.|$|E

40|$|Alluvial river {{channels}} are self-formed by the sediment-laden flow that is supplied {{to them from}} upstream and the interactions between this flow and the materials forming the channel bed and banks. Thus, any changes in the volumes of solid and liquid discharge or {{the resistance of the}} boundary materials can produce adjustments in the form of river channels over time. These shifts may increase or decrease the capacity of a channel to contain flood flows. However, despite a wealth of studies on the average geometry of river channels across different scales and climatic regimes, there has not yet been a systematic assessment of the rates and controls of <b>trends</b> in <b>channel</b> form. Using a combination of USGS data, including manual field measurements and mean daily streamflow data at hundreds of stream gages, this work is the first attempt to quantify how <b>trends</b> in <b>channel</b> geometry develop over decadal timescales and how they contribute to shifts in flood hazard, in comparison with trends in streamflow. Findings reveal that two-thirds of all channel cross-sections studied exhibit significant <b>trends</b> in <b>channel</b> geometry. The majority of the investigated US river {{channels are}} eroding, with widening and deepening trends partially offset by decreases in average flow velocity. Rates of change are principally controlled by the channel size. Although large <b>channels</b> develop larger <b>trends,</b> changes are proportionally greater in small channels in percentage terms. A secondary major control is hydrology: rates of change in channel geometry are heightened by the variability and flashiness of flow regimes. Finally, results show that changing flood frequencies can only be accurately quantified when both hydrologic and geomorphic trends are accounted for, and that flood hazard is significantly increasing across the studied sites. These documented <b>trends</b> in <b>channel</b> geometry, hydraulics, and flood hazard have important implications for the management of alluvial channels, navigation, and riverside infrastructure...|$|R
30|$|This {{work has}} {{presented}} a channel-estimation method and an enhanced MMSE detector for an MC-CDMA system under the rapidly fading channel and colored noise. The proposed RML method can simultaneously estimate {{the parameters of}} channel and colored noise, and the variance of driving noise in the time domain with a simple scheme. The MMSE detector will be enhanced by using the estimated parameters. The proposed channel-estimation method can work in the time domain because the parameters of colored noise are estimated by using the residues generated {{in the process of}} the recursive channel-estimation algorithm. Another advantage is that the number of estimated parameters in the time domain is less than that in the frequency domain. Thus, the computational complexity can be significantly reduced by decreasing the number of estimated parameters. The decision-directed RML-based channel-tracking algorithm can reduce occupancy of the available bandwidth. Furthermore, a one-step linear <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> predictor is proposed to feed more accurate channel parameters to MMSE detector for improving the current data detection. The MSE of the proposed channel-estimation scheme is improved and the SER is very close to the case with the perfectly known channel parameters. The proposed scheme provides better performance than the other methods for MC-CDMA systems under the rapidly fading channel and colored noise from simulation. It is because none of the conventional channel-estimation methods can estimate the parameters of colored noise in real time or they have other drawbacks, that is, occupying of large bandwidth, inaccuracy in the fast fading channel and under the colored noise, and so forth. Therefore, the proposed decision-directed RML-based channel-tracking method with a one-step linear <b>trend</b> <b>channel</b> predictor is very useful for MC-CDMA systems over rapidly Rayleigh fading channel with colored noise.|$|E

They reach thicknesses of [...] and contain small amounts of hyaloclastite. The feeder of their origins has not been discovered but is likely located at the summit of the mound. These lavas form ice-marginal edifies, suggesting that every lava flow was erupted about 10,000years ago when the vast Cordilleran Ice Sheet was retreating and remains of glacial ice were sparse.|$|R
40|$|Sandstone {{channels}} are constant hazards to coal mining operations, {{the presence of}} a channel over a seam can result in thinning of the seam, changes in stress orientations, variation in stress intensity, abrasive cutting, roof hangup, faulting, jointing, loading of the face and even wind blasts. Prediction of the <b>trend</b> of a <b>channel</b> is usually difficult as channels tend to meander and follow complex orientations. However, geological mapping of development roadways can provide very good information on where to expect channels. Mapping paleodrainage indicators at Yancoals’ Ashton Coal Mine in the Hunter valley demonstrates <b>channel</b> <b>trends</b> can be projected through analysis of these indicators. Recognising and recording oriented indicators on hazard plans can assist in forewarning where channels may be anticipated. The experience at the Ashton Coal Mine shows how recording these features provide a means of predicting <b>channel</b> <b>trends.</b> Drainage pattern interpretation of the sandstone channels was possible due to excellent exposure of coarse grain channel sediment, levee, and overbank facies deposition. Comparison of the plotted drainage trends with paleodrainage direction indicated by oriented plant debris demonstrates direct correlation, using paleodrainage indicators {{in the absence of an}} exposure of the channel base can be used to predict the <b>trend</b> of the <b>channel</b> at a specific location...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of recently acquired 3 D seismic surveys over large areas of passive margin settings has led to considerable advances in the comprehension of deep-water depositional systems (Fonnesu, 2003). In this project have been used a 3 D seismic data from Western part of the Lower Congo Basin, offshore Angola, to investigate deep-water depositional systems to characterize channel systems along the pinch out features in terms of geometries, morphometric and architectural elements {{with respect to the}} growing salt anticline. It is mainly based on attribute plan-view maps and 2 D seismic sections view. For that, the studied stratigraphic sequence bounded by horizons A and B base and top respectively is subdivided in three different stages namely stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 from extracted isoproportional slices. The interpreted stage 1 shows weakly confined system characterized by organized sinuous stacking channels A and B, 500 m &# 150; 2 km wide, 14 km long, east &# 150; west <b>trend</b> for <b>channel</b> A and 150 m &# 150; 1. 5 km wide, 13 km long, east &# 150; west <b>trend</b> for <b>channel</b> B. The channels in this stage are classified as meandering channel belts due to their sinuosity values according to Janocko et al., (2013). The interpreted stage 2 shows confined system characterized by disorganized stacking channels C and D, 1 &# 150; 2 km wide, 8 km long, northeast &# 150; southwest <b>trend</b> for <b>channel</b> C and 1 &# 150; 3. 5 km wide, 12 km long, east &# 150; west <b>trend</b> for <b>channel</b> D. According to Janocko et al., (2013), the channels in this stage are considered non meandering channel belts due to their low sinuosity values. In the last stage 3, are interpreted different features such as polygonal faults, slump deposits and pockmarks. All different features identified in three studied stages, gives idea that the study area has been strongly affected by salt tectonics which therefore impacted the development, morphology and orientation of the channel systems within the studied stratigraphic sequence.

40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{analyses}} of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) coupled with catchment area based discharge estimation techniques provide {{a relatively simple}} means of modelling contiguous downstream <b>trends</b> in <b>channel</b> gradient, total stream power, and in riverscapes conducive to regime analysis, also specific stream power. For a small, high relief, coastal catchment in SE Australia, good agreement was obtained between channel gradients derived from a 25 m cell-size DEM and field survey equivalents over distances of several kilometres, indicating that channel gradients derived from DEMs can have a reasonable degree of absolute as well as relative accuracy over multi-kilometre reach scales.
