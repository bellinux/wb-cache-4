5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans any reason to be moral.|$|E

For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of {{it as a kind of}} thing, e.g., x is a cat.

Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts.|$|E

25|$|In such a way, Waldman asserted: {{defying the}} law is on its face {{generally}} a bad <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases, especially if the legal system is basically decent; therefore, {{in order to meet}} this objection, those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law. Answering Waldman's objections, King often used such a particular argument: the evils being opposed were so serious, so numerous, and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort. Although the means were regrettable, the end justified the means.|$|E

Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> it let us take control of what we needed to do.

500|$|Fisher and Flota trace chamber pop to [...] "at least" [...] the mid 1990s. According to Natalie Waliek {{of music}} {{retailer}} Newbury Comics, the then-"renewed interest in psychedelia" [...] and the [...] "overlap with the cocktail/lounge music <b>thing,</b> <b>because</b> that music [...] has orchestrations", likely {{contributed to the}} sales of ork-pop albums, but acts were restricted to only a moderate degree of commercial success. The majority of musicians were aged beyond their early 20s, and many struggled to achieve significant retail or radio success compared to modern rock. In the past, record companies had helped facilitate large multi-instrumental bands by financing instruments like strings, horns, and keyboards on artists' albums, but this became rarer as time went on. [...] Touring with full string and brass ensembles also proved difficult for some, which became another factor that prevented the genre's mainstream success.|$|E

In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing.

500|$|After {{recording}} Astral Weeks, Morrison {{moved with}} his wife to a home on a mountain top in the Catskills near Woodstock, a hamlet in upstate New York with an artistic community. Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far out a lot of people can't relate to it. I had to forget about the artistic <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> it didn't make sense on a practical level. One has to live." [...] He began writing songs for Moondance in July 1969. The musicians who went on to record the album with Morrison were recruited from Woodstock and would continue working with him for several years, including guitarist John Platania, saxophonist Jack Schroer, and keyboardist Jef Labes. The singer left after the Woodstock music festival in August attracted an influx of people to the area.|$|E

She further explained that lots of things came up during that time, including her first break-up with her first boyfriend Jorge Santos. Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics <b>thing</b> <b>because</b> it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice.
