40|$|When {{drilling}} a {{well there}} is a risk of serious damage caused by drillstring vibrations. Shock and vibration are identified as a cause of premature failure on drill bit and components in the bottom hole assembly (BHA), resulting in lost time for operators and costing service companies several millions in repair each year. The expenditures incurred by drillstring vibrations include reduced rate of penetration (ROP), tripping and poor drilling performance. Currently, several tools and techniques are used in the attempt to minimize shock and vibration. For vibration mitigation to be more effective in the future, the most effective tools and techniques must be designated, implemented and improved. The main objectives of this thesis are to give an insight into the main vibration problem and determine effective mitigation tools and techniques, with regards to the BHA design, which can minimize shock and vibration, and improve the drilling performance in the future. A particular focus was given to anti-vibration tools, and vibration prevention in underreamer applications. The thesis is divided into four main parts; theory on drillstring vibrations, evaluation of various tools and techniques for vibration mitigation, including supplier input, a performance analysis of the Anti Stick-slip Technology (AST) and finally a discussion and conclusion part. Several field case studies are presented to illustrate how the tools and techniques can reduce the risk of detrimental vibrations. The work is based on literature reviews and is substantiated by comparative field experiences. Additional information was acquired through conversations with Statoil, the directional drilling suppliers and tool suppliers. These conversations proved highly valuable and resulted in several proposed tools and techniques that should be considered when designing the BHA. The thesis revealed that BHA design awareness can lead to huge advancements in terms of minimizing shock and vibration. Roller reamers should be added to the assembly if high stick-slip levels are expected or if the stabilizers experience extensive friction. Anti-vibration tools, such as AST and Frank´s Harmonic Isolation (HI) tool should be considered, as field experience indicates that these tools can reduce the vibration level. The results of the AST performance analysis indicated a 21 % increase in ROP for runs including the tool. For underreamer operations a great potential exists in placing an expandable stabilizer above the underreamer. Another BHA alteration that should be considered is tapered stabilization, which can lead to fewer <b>twist-offs</b> in large hole sections. In the future, the industry must be willing to make changes in order to minimize shock and vibration. A constant push towards better procedures and innovative technology is needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of the bond between overlay and concrete substrate is traditionally measured with a pull-off test, which indicates whether the tensile {{strength of}} the bond between the overlay and concrete is stronger than the tensile capacity of concrete itself. In many instances, {{it may be more}} useful to measure the bond shear capacity of the interface because shear strength is what controls the composite action between overlay and substrate. <b>Twist-off</b> testing can measure the bond shear capacity. In order to compare the two methodologies of pull-off and <b>twist-off,</b> a parallel group of tests was conducted on two sets of specimens: the first was an FRP reinforcing overlay on concrete substrate while the second was concrete.

40|$|In {{oil and gas}} drilling, {{corrosion}} or {{tensile stress}} can give small holes in the drillstring, which can cause leakage and prevent sufficient flow of drilling fluid. If such washout remains undetected and develops, the consequence can be a complete <b>twist-off</b> of the drillstring. Aiming at early washout diagnosis, this paper employs an adaptive observer to estimate friction parameters in the nonlinear process. Non-Gaussian noise is a nuisance in the parameter estimates, and dedicated generalized likelihood tests are developed to make efficient washout detection with the multivariate t-distribution encountered in data. Change detection methods are developed using logged sensor data from a horizontal 1400 m managed pressure drilling test rig. Detection scheme design is conducted using probabilities for false alarm and detection to determine thresholds in hypothesis tests. A multivariate approach is demonstrated to have superior diagnostic properties {{and is able to}} diagnose a washout at very low levels.

40|$|It can be {{expected}} that many elderly people have impaired opening capacity of food packaging bearing in mind the changes in functionality and physical strength that occur during ageing. This study determined {{the relation of the}} quantitative force required to open selected food packaging systems with findings derived from qualitative focus group studies to retrieve comprehensive information on the specific needs of seniors. The focus group studies revealed that the assessment of the ease of opening is very subjective and can vary from objective measurements. The quantitative measurement of the force required to open the ‘easy to open’ thermoformed tray resulted in considerably higher peel initiation forces of 22. 50 [*]±[*] 1. 62 [*]N compared to the standard tray (12. 80 [*]±[*] 1. 93 [*]N). However, the packaging type was still felt to be easier to open because of the enlarged tab and peeling corner, which was said to be easy to grip. Conversely, the stand-up pouches with <b>twist-off</b> caps could only be opened with difficulty because of the small caps and the difficulty in breaking seals, despite the substantially lower opening forces of 0. 46 [*]±[*] 0. 06 [*]Nm compared with the other torque closures. The evaluation of a package was found to be only partly dependent on the required opening force but strongly influenced by various design factors and consumer's expectations as well as experiences...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applied a}} {{modified}} OxiTop® system {{to determine the}} oxygen uptake rate during a 2 -day respiration test of selected composting materials at different moisture contents, air-filled porosities and composition of composting mixtures. The modification of the OxiTop® respirometer included replacement and adjustment of a glass vessel (i. e. a 1. 9 -L glass vessel with wide mouth was used instead of a standard 1 -L glass bottle, additionally the <b>twist-off</b> vessel lid was adjusted to attach the measuring head) and application of a closed steel mesh cylinder of 5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height with the open surface area of the mesh of approximately 56. 2 %. This modification allowed obtaining different bulk densities (and thus air-porosities) of the investigated composting materials in laboratory composting studies. The test was performed for apple pomace and composting mixtures of apple pomace with wood chips at ratios of 1 : 0. 5, 1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5 (d. w), moisture contents of 60 %, 65 % and 75 % and air-filled porosities ranging from 46 % to 1 %.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the design and {{analysis}} for failure at three different drill pipes. When drilling boreholes, for example in the Oil & Gas industry, a hole is drilled into the ground which can be several kilometers long. One of main type of problem that can occur while drilling is the torque on the drill pipe can cause it to break (called <b>twist-off).</b> This problem results in drilling delays. Twist-offs also usually results in loss of expensive equipment. Therefore, ALGOR software has been use as the FEA tool to do the analysis to reduce this problem. Six different values of torque range from 2000 N. m to 3000 N. m {{is applied to the}} end of the pipe stand which is consist of three assembly of pipes. The materials of the pipe have been chosen are AISI 1010, ASTM A 36 and AISI 4150 steels that have different mechanical properties the see the differences. The test results show that AISI 4150 is the most suitable material to use which gives 2800 N. m torque value before it starts to fail. Meanwhile, a constant pattern of failure has determined for these three pipes at the same location of the second engaged thread of the pipe assembly, between the male and female thread at the joint. For improvement, to see the differences from another point of view, the analysis for this drill pipe design is suggested to do with different thickness and length in order to analyze how much the maximum allowable torque value can be applied to the pipe before it starts to fail...|$|E
40|$|Laboratories in {{the federal}} Laender {{detected}} plasticisers in around 190 food samples from jars with <b>twist-off</b> lids, above all in oil-containing foods like pasta sauces and pesto. The sub-stances migrate from the lid seals of the jars to food and in many samples they exceeded the limits envisaged within the EU for plasticisers. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a health assessment of the contaminated foods and supplements the findings from its 2005 Opinion. Plasticisers are used by industry in order to render plastics like PVC pliable. In addition to lid seals, they are used in many different ways: in carpets, cable insulation, toys or cling film. As plasticisers are not chemically bound to PVC, they may be dissolved or gassed out when they {{come into contact with}} liquids or fats. The toxic properties of plasticisers differ from sub-stance to substance. The EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) undertook health assessments of individual substances and estab-lished tolerable daily intakes (TDIs). In its exposure assessment, BfR comes {{to the conclusion that the}} TDIs for various plasticis-ers are, in some cases, considerably exceeded through the consumption of the foods exam-ined, and that the consumption of these foods can harm health. This applies above all to ex-posure to the plasticiser, DEHP. This is particularly worrying because consumers ingest plas-ticisers not only from food packaging but from many other products. BfR, therefore, recommends foregoing the use of plasticisers which, like DEHP, have particu-larly harmful properties when in contact with food and replacing them with less harmful sub-stitutes. Furthermore, the data available on the incidence of plasticisers like DEHA and DINCH in food, for instance as a consequence of their use in cling film, should be improved in order to be able to better estimate the overall exposure of consumers...|$|E

This material was produced following ISO Guide 34 : 2009 [] and is certified in accordance to ISO Guide 35 : 2006 [2]. The starting material was wild Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) caught {{in the area of}} the Flix reservoir at the Ebro River, Spain. The filleted fish was cut and cryogenically milled before mixing. Pre-cooking followed and after further mixing, the material was filled in jars, sterilised in an autoclave and finally labelled as ERM-CE 100. Between-unit homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006 []. Within-unit homogeneity was quantified to determine the minimum sample intake. The material was characterised by an interlaboratory comparison of laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025 []. Technically invalid results were removed but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated in accordance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [] and include uncertainties related to possible inhomogeneity, instability and characterisation. The material is intended for the quality control and assessment of method performance. As with any reference material, it can be used for establishing quality control charts or validation studies.

40|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{technology was}} extended and modified to drill the first well of a subsurface geothermal energy extraction {{system at the}} Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock (HDR) experimental site. Borehole geometries, extremely hard and abrasive granite rock, and high formation temperatures combined to provide a challenging environment for directional drilling tools and instrumentation. Completing {{the first of the}} two-wellbore HDR system resulted in the definition of operation limitations of -many conventional directional drilling tools, instrumentation, and techniques. The successful completion of the first wellbore, Energy Extraction Well No. 2 (EE- 21), to a measured depth of 4. 7 km (15, 300 ft) in granite reservoir rock with a bottomhole temperature of 320 C (610 F) required {{the development of a new}} high-temperature downhole motor and modification of existing wireline-conveyed steering tool systems. Conventional rotary-driven directional assemblies were successfully modified to accommodate the very hard and abrasive rock encountered while drilling nearly 2. 6 km (8, 500 ft) of directional hole to a final inclination of 35 {sup o} from the vertical at the controlled azimuthal orientation. Data were collected to optimize the drilling procedures far the programmed directional drilling of well EE- 3 parallel to, and 370 metres (1, 200 ft) above, Drilling equipment and techniques used in drilling wellbores for extraction of geothermal energy from hot granite were generally similar to those that are standard and common to hydrocarbon drilling practices. However, it was necessary to design some new equipment for this program: some equipment was modified especially for this program and some was operated beyond normal ratings. These tools and procedures met with various degrees of success. Two types of shock subs were developed and tested during this project. However, downhole time was limited, and formations were so varied that analysis of the capabilities of these items is not conclusive. Temperature limits of the tools were exceeded. EE- 2. Commercial drilling and fishing jars were improved during the drilling program. Three-cone, tungsten-carbide insert bit performance with downhole motors was limited by rapid gauge wear.
