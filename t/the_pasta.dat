5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. <b>The</b> <b>pasta</b> is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
25|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} {{and protein}} coagulation {{are the major}} changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> cause a constant change in structure as <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> cooks.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> {{leaves the}} dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried pasta is about 12% which helps <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, pasta is exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> and prevents cracking.|$|E

25|$|Kitchen pasta machines, {{also called}} pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make {{large amounts of}} fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand, and by turning a hand crank, extrudes <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> through a machine 'comb' that shapes <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> noodles as they are extruded.|$|E
25|$|The {{cylinder}} {{also has}} an air vacuum chamber which removes air bubbles from the dough before extruding. Otherwise small bubbles will form in <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> and decreases the mechanical strength which cause breakage from hours to days after drying. The air also oxidizes the carotenoid or xanthophyll which results in a white, chalky appearance of <b>the</b> <b>pasta.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drying {{process is}} the most {{difficult}} and critical part of making <b>the</b> <b>pasta.</b> If the products dry too fast, they would crack during or after drying process and have a poor appearance and low mechanical strength. If the products dry too slowly, they would spoil and become moldy. So <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> should lose right amount of moisture in right amount of time.|$|E

25|$|Durum wheat {{is ground}} into {{semolina}} flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded.

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. <b>The</b> <b>pasta</b> will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Both {{dried and}} fresh pasta {{come in a}} number of shapes and varieties, with 310 {{specific}} forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example, the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed and specialty or decorative shapes. As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno in which <b>the</b> <b>pasta</b> incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} {{of high quality}} functional pasta from non-conventional raw materials represents a challenge.

The cooking, textural and colour characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>pastas</b> were evaluated and compared to control sample containing exclusively durum wheat semolina. Generally, material addition to <b>the</b> durum wheat <b>pasta</b> increased cooking losses, swelling index and water absorption, whilst reduced firmness and resistance to uniaxial extension of pastas.

Pasta prepared with 15 g/ 100 g semolina of oat flour showed the best performance (except for the colour) compared to <b>the</b> other experimental <b>pasta</b> samples, but was significantly different to control durum wheat sample. Combinations of fibre rich additions were studied with the inclusion of inulin GR having a less deteriorating effect when added in combination with oat flour.
