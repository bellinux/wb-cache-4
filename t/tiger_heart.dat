60|$|The grave {{was close}} to the {{outskirts}} of the village, and, on one side, the jungle came up to within a few yards of it. The spot was surrounded by a strong and high bamboo fence, except at one point where a narrow but very conspicuous opening had been left. Here a sharp spear was so arranged beside the opening that it could be shot across it at a point corresponding with the height of a <b>tiger's</b> <b>heart</b> from the ground--as well, at least, as that point could be estimated by men who were pretty familiar with tigers. The motive power to propel this spear was derived from a green bamboo, so strong that it required several powerful men to bend it {{in the form of a}} bow. A species of trigger was arranged to let the bent bow fly, and a piece of fine cord passed from this across the opening about breast-high for a tiger. The intention was that the animal, in entering the enclosure, should become its own executioner-- should commit unintentional suicide, if we may so put it.|$|R

5000|$|When the High Evolutionary mutated a wolf into a {{powerful}} creature called the Man-Beast, his creation turned evil, and escaped. High Evolutionary created a second altered animal {{to catch his}} rogue wolf. He mutated a white Bengal tigress into a woman, whom he named the White Tiger. White Tiger's bestial origins gave her cat-like speed and reflexes, and she was highly skilled in martial arts. On her quest to find Man-Beast, White Tiger joined a team of villains called the U-Foes, {{and fell in love}} with their leader, Vector. When the U-Foes attacked a supervillain prison, White Tiger left the team, and searching for heroes to help her, found Iron Fist. She was intrigued by him, and joined his team Heroes for Hire. White Tiger tried to keep her origins a secret, but during a training session with Iron Fist, he defeated her several times in mock combat. Her anger overwhelmed her, and she lost control and reverted to her tiger form. She feared that the others would shun her for her animal-nature, but they accepted her as part of the team.White Tiger found herself becoming attracted to Iron Fist, as she thought he was a [...] "fine hunter", and was impressed with his skills and stealth. However, she learned that Iron Fist was in love with Misty Knight.

When Misty told White Tiger that humans don't use dominance to fall in love, it broke White <b>Tiger's</b> <b>heart.</b> When White <b>Tiger</b> finally captured Man-Beast, she begged the High Evolutionary to turn her back into a tiger, to remove her humanity, as she couldn't deal with the pain of human emotions.

5000|$|Fiona and Malcolm bore a son on a winter's night, {{but soon}} {{learn from the}} child's fairy godmother - Tiger Lily - that he is prophesied to die {{fighting}} a great evil. Fretting over her son's future, Fiona starts to read up {{on all of the}} fairy lore that she can, in hopes of stopping the prophecy, and comes to believe that her son's undoing, who will be marked by a crescent, has to be born sometime soon. The amount of information she has gained from the fairy lore allows Fiona to cast a spell and turn herself into a fairy, and she convinces Tiger Lily to travel with her to all of the newborns of that winter to check for the birthmark. Finding that none have it, Fiona comes up with a new idea that requires being allowed into the sacred fairy vault, but Tiger Lily soon deduces that Fiona's plan involves combining two spells, which is against the rules, to create a curse - the Dark Curse - which will banish all of the children to a land without magic, eliminating the threat they pose to her son. Tiger Lily tries to stop Fiona, but this only results in having her heart ripped out by the now deranged fairy who, upon proclaiming her willingness to kill her own son's fairy godmother, has her magic completely darkened... and the crescent appear on her wrist. Evil wasn't born this winter, but it was made. The Blue Fairy is able to return <b>Tiger</b> Lily's <b>heart,</b> but <b>Tiger</b> Lily makes one last attempt to reason with Fiona by offering her the Shears of Destiny to remove her powers; however, Fiona instead uses them to cut her son's fate as the Savior, believing that she needs her powers to protect him.

Before Fiona is dragged through the portal, she swears to do everything in her power to reunite with her son. He needs to be raised normally now, but Malcolm isn't father material anymore.

6000|$|If {{the ever}} present {{impression}} of this awful, most moving, yet most soothing thought, {{be a law}} of spiritual breadth and height, {{there is still a}} peril in it. Such an impression may inform the soul with a devout mingled sense of grandeur and nothingness, or it may blacken into cynicism and antinomian living for self and the day. It may be a solemn and holy refrain, sounding far off but clear in the dusty course of work and duty; or it may be the comforting chorus of a diabolic drama of selfishness and violence. As a reaction against religious theories which make humanity over-abound in self-consequence, and fill individuals with the strutting importance of creatures with private souls to save or lose, even such cynicism as Byron's was wholesome and nearly forgivable. Nevertheless, the most important question that we can ask of any great teacher, as of the walk and conversation of any commonest person, remains this--how far has he strengthened and raised the conscious and harmonious dignity of humanity; how stirred in men and women, many or few, deeper and more active sense of the worth and obligation and innumerable possibilities, not of their own little lives, one or another, but of life collectively; how heightened the self-respect of the race? There is no need to plant oneself in a fool's paradise, with no eye for the weakness of men, the futility of their hopes, the irony of their fate, the dominion of the satyr and the <b>tiger</b> in their <b>hearts.</b> Laughter has a fore-place in life. All this we may see and show that we see, and yet so throw it behind the weightier facts of nobleness and sacrifice, of the boundless gifts which fraternal union has given, and has the power of giving, as to kindle in every breast, not callous to exalted impressions, the glow of sympathetic endeavour, and of serene exultation in the bond that makes 'precious the soul of man to man.' ...|$|R
