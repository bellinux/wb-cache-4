Mr. Burns {{declares}} {{that he is in}} love with Jacqueline, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, against Marge's interest. Meanwhile, Bart buys a $350 Itchy & Scratchy animation cel with one of Homer's credit cards. In order to pay Homer back, Bart blackmails Mr. Burns by threatening to ruin his suit before his date.|$|E
500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E
500|$|Brian’s gay cousin Jasper {{comes to}} Quahog with his Filipino boyfriend Ricardo, and announces that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married. Everyone is delighted [...] except for Lois, who is against {{same-sex}} marriage. Later, Mayor Adam West reveals {{in the city}} center a solid gold statue of the Honey Smacks mascot Dig 'Em, and dedicates the statue to the servicemen who died in what {{he refers to as}} the [...] "recent Gulf conflict". The cost of the statue puts the city in debt. In order to distract the townspeople, he proposes a bill outlawing same sex marriage. Meanwhile, Chris falls for Alyssa, a beautiful girl who belongs to the Young Republicans, and joins the group to impress her.|$|E

They went on to label the video as [...] "hot", and saying they are [...] "striking while the iron is hot", meaning <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a lot out while they can, because they are big at the moment. MUUMUSE stated, [...] "The time between the 2:30 and 2:45 mark is all you really need to get the good stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 15 September 2015, the House of Commons {{voted to}} {{decrease}} Tax Credit thresholds, {{a law that}} came into effect on 6 April 2016. Opponents claimed that it would harm those on low incomes. Simon Hopkins, Chief Executive of charity Turn2us commented [...] "Today's vote in the House of Commons will mean one thing {{for many of the}} poorest working families in the UK; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> poorer. Tax credits are a vital source of income for those on a low wage and for many they make up a substantial portion of their monthly income.|$|E
2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but {{it turns out to be}} illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Caputo {{worked as}} the {{campaign}} manager for Carl Paladino in his 2010 bid for Governor of New York. Caputo was profiled in a subject piece about him during the campaign in The New York Times; the paper said of his campaign strategy: [...] "Michael R. Caputo's impish spirit and no-holds-barred campaign style have helped propel his boss, Carl P. Paladino, a relatively unknown real estate mogul from Buffalo, to the Republican nomination for New York governor". Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and {{in an interview with}} The New York Times, his campaign manager embraced the outsider nature of their bid in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election: [...] "This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows that each of us comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything." [...] Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager to The New York Times: [...] "I'm facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes. You've got to let them know <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> punished." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Forward related how one {{individual}} felt: [...] "'There's a great frustration that American Jews {{want to do}} something,' said Ira Youdovin, {{executive vice president of}} the Chicago Board of Rabbis. [...] 'In 1947, some number would have enlisted in the Haganah, ' he said, referring to the pre-state Jewish armed force. [...] 'There was a special American brigade. [...] Nowadays you can't do that. [...] The battle here is the hasbarah war,' Youdovin said, using a Hebrew term for public relations. [...] 'We're winning, but we're very much concerned about the bad stuff.'" [...] Indicative of the diversity of opinion is a 2003 Boston Globe profile of the CAMERA media watchdog group in which Mark Jurkowitz observes: [...] "To its supporters, CAMERA is figuratively - and perhaps literally - doing God's work, battling insidious anti-Israeli bias in the media. [...] But its detractors see CAMERA as a myopic and vindictive special interest group trying to muscle its views into media coverage." [...] A former spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in New York City said that the result of this lobbying of the media was: “Of course, a lot of self-censorship goes on. Journalists, editors, and politicians are going to think twice about criticizing Israel if they know <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> thousands of angry calls in a matter of hours. The Jewish lobby is good at orchestrating pressure.” ...|$|E

Seven million revolutionists, organized, working day and night, are preaching the revolution--that passionate gospel, the Brotherhood of Man. Not only is it a cold-blooded economic propaganda, but it is in essence a religious propaganda with a fervour in it of Paul and Christ. The capitalist class has been indicted.

Yet at any given dinner the orator who passes out mere elocution to his hearers has a success almost as instant and splendid as his clowning brother.

They prefer also the old speakers to new ones; they like the familiar taps of humor, of eloquence; if they have tasted the brew before, they know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> The note of their mood is tolerance, but tolerance of the accustomed, the expected; not tolerance of the novel, the surprising.
