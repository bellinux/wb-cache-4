40|$|Precision {{machining}} {{has received}} more and more industry-wide attention as dimensional accuracy becomes a significant measure of quality in a product. The key in achieving today's quality requirement is, therefore, precision of a machine tool. Since {{the invention of the}} first CNC machine tool in the 1960 s, machine tool research has entered an almost stagnant stage. There are numerous reasons for the slow progress, and the lack of system- wide studies of the machine tool performance is one of them. The research presented in this thesis focuses on improving machining accuracy using a systems engineering approach. A conventional lathe during machining is taken under consideration as a machining system. The <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> is identified as a critical component in the machining system to achieve the defined machining accuracy. Smart material made actuators are used to design a new <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> structure that is capable of carrying out an active vibration control during machining. In this thesis research, the fabrication of the designed <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> is completed. Results obtained from the initial tests strongly demonstrate its capability to attenuate tool vibration during machining in an active and intelligent way. Thus, the smart <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> system fulfills the design objective of achieving microscopic level machining precision on a low-cost conventional machine tool platform. Suggestions on the actuator specifications are made for further improvement on vibration compensation...|$|E

During the boring operation, the accelerometer was fixed on the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> to record the vibration signal. The surface roughness was measured using perthometer.

40|$|Tool {{vibration}} is {{a well-known}} fact in causing poor surface finish, accelerated tool wear, and unstable machining operations. Due to the availability of active or "smart" materials, researchers in the machine tool industry are now focusing on applying active control to attenuate tool vibration during machining. In this thesis research, efforts are dedicated to investigating the mechanical and electrical behavior of a designed <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> structure in which lead-magnesium-niobate (PMN) actuators are used as built-in devices for vibration control. Research is focused on using finite element method (FEM) to identify the dynamic characteristics of the <b>tool</b> <b>post,</b> establishing an experimental testbed environment for experimental verifications, and implementing the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> in a shop floor machining environment to test its performance, both mechanically and electronically. Results obtained from this investigation has justified the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> design for its effectiveness in carrying out vibration compensation during machining. A 10 to 20 percent of reduction has been observed with the PMN actuators in action. Significant findings of this research include 2 to 3 mm floating of the dynamic equilibrium position of the tool tip during the compensation, {{and the effect of}} interplay between actuator-driving frequency and workpiece rotation on in-process compensation. Control of the coupling coefficient deserves special, attention for maintaining an acceptable efficiency of conversion from electrical energy to mechanical energy. Knowledge gained from this study has provided guidelines not only for off- line optimization, but also for controller designs when PMN actuators are applied. <P...|$|E

40|$|In any {{manufacturing}} industry, {{machine tools}} {{play an important}} role in the production of parts. The dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the work piece depends mainly on the condition of the machine. The vibration signatures for different arrangement are recorded to determine the dynamic characteristics of the system, whichinclude work piece, tool and lathe components. These vibration signatures are analyzed to determine causes of inaccuracy in the manufacturing process and faulty components. Many condition monitoring techniques are available to monitor the machine tool experimentally. Among these techniques vibration monitoring is the most widely used technique because most of the failures in the machine tool could be due to increased vibration level. Experimental vibration analyses are conducted for a lathe system to detect the possibility of faults and to develop accurate cutting process. Experiments are carried out using the condition monitoring instrumentVIBROMETER to measure vibration severity for different cutting speed, depth of cut, feed rate. The value of vibration (rms and peak) at <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> and at bearing is determined from the experimental analyses, it is found that the vibration velocity increases at the cutting speed, depth of cut and feed rate increases...|$|E
