5000|$|La Guacherna unofficially {{started as}} early as the {{beginnings}} of the 20th century in barrio Abajo. In its beginnings, during the pre-carnival days, people used to call others by playing a guache (percussion instrument producing a similar sound to that of a maraca) to signal the commencement of dancing, which was accompanied by tamboras and flauta de millo as well as by candles to illuminate the night, making the surrounding people joyful. In 1974, this tradition was recovered <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> composer Esthercita Forero's initiative, who, along with Alicia de Andréis, achieved to make the carnival board introduce it in the carnival program. This parade did not exist formally until that year and it was named as La Guacherna after its creator, Esther forero.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{thanks to}} the spread of new {{recording}} technologies and sound production, the web of relationships between different and heterogeneous cultures is so complex that the ubiquity phenomenon of cultural transference must be reconstructed. Within this paper, the author describes and analyzes Afro-Caribbean music’s trajectories and migrations around the world. Since 1930, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> industry expansion, Afro-Caribbean music is very well known all over the world. It has travelled from Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico {{to the rest of the}} world, passing through London and New York. This paper analyzes how Afro-Caribbean music has spread in Japan. The case of The Orquesta de la Luz is used as an example of how Japanese people relate to music from other cultures. As it can be seen, it has nothing to do with the simplistic interpretation of domination and homogenization of culture. The concept of globalization has been in fashion for more than ten years now and, considering the case of satellite television and the world spread of contents that are standardized to a certain extent, the impression is to be experiencing a rising homogenizatio...|$|E

40|$|At its {{beginnings}} poetry was always connected with music. In Ancient Greece poetry {{was not only}} sung, but also danced. Later, the arts separated. However, in Romanticism music became once more a very important notion for poets. Romantics believed that <b>music</b> helped <b>to</b> create <b>the</b> landscape of the human soul. For the same reasons, musicality of poetry fascinated symbolists. In my article, I am analysing two poems of Paul Verlaine, a French romantic very important also for the Symbolist mouvement, and a master piece of Young Poland’s Symbolism and Impressionism poetry by Leopold Staff. As the poets use a number of proceedings to change their words into <b>music,</b> <b>the</b> three poems are very musical. Taking into consideration that symbolists believed that music was able to transmit emotional meanings, the musical form helped them to prepare their readers {{to come to a}} deeper sense. Not containing any story, all poems are purely lyrical. Each of them evokes autumnal rain which mix with tears, all poetic personae being extremely sad. The musicality lets the readers understand deeper their sadness which reflects also their powerlessness, so famous in the Decadent mouvement. Briefly, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>music</b> <b>the</b> poets manage <b>to</b> draw a beautiful picture of a Decadent soul.

Its first flush of success was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War and the Siege of Paris (which also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early death of Giuseppina Bozzacchi, on her 17th birthday), but eventually it became the most-performed ballet at the Opéra.|$|R
