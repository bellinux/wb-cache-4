40|$|In many sociological {{books and}} in {{instructions}} for interviewers a directive {{can be found}} telling the interviewer to interview only the respondent himself. The presence of any <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> is considered to have negative influence on the respondents’ replies. The author has carried out research into the problem of third persons’ presence and the influence they may have on the respondents’ replies. The materials were collected {{with the help of}} questionnaires which were filled in immediately after every interview. The questionnaires were attached to 9 research programmes carried out by various research centres in various milieus all over Poland 8073 questionnaires were filled in. The paper consists of two basic parts. In the first part the author presents various social situations in which respondents in the presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> were interviewed. Analyses have proved that the percentage of interviews in which <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> took part is very high, it ranges from 27, 4 % to 63, 7 %, and it depends on the study itself, the total percentage amounts to 46, 1. <b>Third</b> <b>persons</b> not only accompany the respondents, but also take part in their conversations and interfere with their replies. The percentage of interviews in which <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> did speak is – generally speaking – high and reaches 56, 3 %. The presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> during interviews and their participation in conversation depend on: 1. social and local conditions in which the research is carried out; 2. some demographic features of the respondents (sex, education, age etc.); 3. the relationship between the respondents and the persons who accompany them (wife, husband, various members of the family, or persons who do not belong to the family – friend s, neighbours etc.); 4. circumstances of the interview (e. g. place of the interview). Among other things it was stated that <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> more frequently accompany the inhabitants of villages and small towns and less frequently the inhabitants of big towns and university graduates. It was also stated that third persons’ participation in the conversation depends on the contents of the question and the problem included in it. The other part of the paper deals with the influence exercised by <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> on the respondents’ replies. In order to determine the influence replies to some questions in the questionnaires for interviewers in the presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> were compared with those interviews during which no other persons were present. The following general conclusions may be formulated: The influence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> – generally speaking – is not strong. Differences between the percentage of replies of a definite kind given in the presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> and those given without their presence amounts to 6 percentage points. But when influence is not considered as a general problem but attention is paid to the fact whether the persons and the respondents are close relations or not and how the <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> behave differences reach as many as 20 percentage points. Since the problem refers to definite categories of <b>third</b> <b>persons,</b> the differences do not concern many groups under investigation. The influence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> was very clear in questions which referred to those persons themselves or included values they themselves accepted. The influence was not always deforming – in some categories of questions – replies given in the presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> may be looked upon as more reliable. In the final part of the paper it was emphasized that: 1. 	The presence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> during interviews in Poland cannot be avoided. 2. 	Although, on the whole, the influence of <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> on the respondents' replies is not very strong, every sociologist must take in, into account. He should know in which interviews <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> took part and who they were so as to be able to correct the obtained results or at least indicate the direction of possible deviations...|$|R

40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} liability {{of members of}} the Board of Directors against <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> The aim of my thesis is to analyse thoroughly the regulation of primary {{and secondary}} liability {{of members of the}} Board of Directors against <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> (so-called 'outside liability') under the laws of the Czech Republic. The reason for choosing this topic is that it is relatively overlooked by most of the authors since they primarily focus on liability of the Directors against their own company (so-called 'inside liability'). By conducting my research I intend to redress such an omission and prove the significance of this issue. Chapter one provides a general overview of the inside liability issue. It explains why the Directors are in discharging their duties primarily accountable to the company for the damage caused by a breach of their duties and why <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> are entitled to claim damages from the Directors only in cases laid down in special statutory provisions. Chapter two together with chapter three form a substantial part of the text and provide the basis for the analysis in the subsequent chapters. Examining the currently effective regulation, these chapters deal with special provisions which constitute direct liability of the Directors for the damage caused to the <b>third</b> <b>persons</b> (most [...] ...|$|R
