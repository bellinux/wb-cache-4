2500|$|Random {{allocation}} in real trials is complex, but conceptually {{the process}} is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed {{in exactly the same}} way and the only differences between them is <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>they</b> receive. For example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, and follow-up calls, should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared.

This included a lack of access to counseling or antidepressant medication, the injured attempting to get surgeries approved and physical therapy covered, a lack of assistance in dealing with a complex compensation workers' program, and health insurers refusing to cover injuries because they occurred during an act of workplace violence.
