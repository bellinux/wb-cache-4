5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of <b>this</b> <b>explosion,</b> Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{observations}} of the nearby SN PTF 11kx, discovered January 16, 2011 (UT) by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), lead {{to the conclusion that}} <b>this</b> <b>explosion</b> arises from single-degenerate progenitor, with a red giant companion, thus suggesting there is no single progenitor path to SN Ia. Direct {{observations of}} the progenitor of PTF11kx were reported in the August 24 edition of Science and support this conclusion, and also show that the progenitor star experienced periodic nova eruptions before the supernova - another surprising discovery.|$|E
5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible in the night sky for 653 days.|$|E

5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its presence was noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern astronomers have discovered the faint remnant of <b>this</b> <b>explosion</b> and determined that it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although <b>this</b> <b>explosion</b> in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed <b>this</b> <b>explosion</b> and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E

25|$|Approximately {{three minutes}} after the initial explosion, a bomb mounted on the Phantom exploded, having been engulfed in flames from the earlier explosions and burning fuel. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> blew a larger hole, {{approximately}} eight feet by seven feet, in the flight deck. The heat from the blast ignited additional fires on the 03 level, and debris from the explosion caused holes in the deck; this allowed burning fuel to spread further, entering the 02 and 01 levels and eventually the first deck. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> also damaged the twin agent units that provided firefighting foam to the area, rendering them inoperable as well as severing fire hoses in the area. In short order two 500 lb (227 kg) Mark 82 bombs detonated in succession. Several {{minutes after the}} detonations a bomb rack holding three Mk 82 bombs exploded. This blast tore a large hole, approximately 18 feet by 22 feet, into the flight deck, and ruptured a 6,000-gallon fuel tank mounted on a tanker aircraft; a massive fireball resulted from the fuel igniting, spreading the fire further. All told, eighteen explosions occurred, blowing eight holes into the flight deck and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Transcriptomics {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined what is possible every decade or so and render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> in transcriptomics has been driven by the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E
25|$|Two and a {{half minutes}} after the initial collision, the {{outboard}} section of the right wing above engine number four exploded, causing parts of the wing to break off. Six seconds after <b>this</b> <b>explosion,</b> another explosion occurred {{in the area of the}} number three engine, causing the pylon and engine to both break off and fall to the ground in flames. Six {{and a half}} seconds after the second explosion, a third explosion occurred, destroying most of the right wing, including the wing tip. The aircraft then went into a violent nose dive, striking the ground at a high velocity of about 220 knots (407km/h) and killing all 100 passengers and the nine crew members on board.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in December 1910, a {{cofferdam}} {{was built}} around the wreck and water was pumped out, exposing the wreck by late 1911. Between 20 November and 2 December 1911, a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral Charles E. Vreeland inspected the wreck. They concluded that an external explosion had triggered {{the explosion of the}} magazines. However, <b>this</b> <b>explosion</b> was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the Sampson Board. The Vreeland Board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines, not by the external explosion. After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in Arlington National Cemetery and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of Maine was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 March 1912.|$|E
25|$|A {{supernova}} is {{a transient}} astronomical event that occurs {{during the last}} stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. <b>This</b> <b>explosion</b> can happen in one of many ways, but {{in all of them}} a significant proportion of the matter in the star is blown away into the surrounding space at extremely high velocities (up to 10% of the speed of light). Unless there is perfect spherical symmetry in these explosions (i.e., unless matter is spewed out evenly in all directions), there will be gravitational radiation from the explosion. This is because gravitational waves are generated by a changing quadrupole moment, which can happen only when there is asymmetrical movement of masses. Since the exact mechanism by which supernovae take place is not fully understood, {{it is not easy to}} model the gravitational radiation emitted by them.|$|E
