A ruling {{in one of these}} cases confirmed that the state constitution had effectively abolished slavery. In 1785 he was chosen by the legislature to sit on a committee which revised the laws of the state, to modernize them and remove references to British authority. In 1789 {{he was a member of}} the state convention that met to ratify the United States Constitution, in which he explained to the convention <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> importance of habeas corpus.

5|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} about the relation between Ragnarök and the 9th century Old High German epic poem Muspilli about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word Muspille appears, and the 9th century Old Saxon epic poem Heliand {{about the life of}} Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify {{the end of the world}} through fire. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of Ragnarök, where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the band}} members grew up together: Dama, Dadah and Bekoto were playmates and {{attended}} the same primary school; during their secondary school studies, Dadah's older brother Nono likewise became {{a close friend of}} Raoul, the older brother of Dama. The high school offered a music program in which Dadah, Nono, Charle, Bekoto and Fafa participated together, with Fafa as a vocalist and Bekoto as a pianist. Beginning in 1970, Raoul became enamored with the acoustic guitar. He met frequently with Dadah and Nono to play together using guitars he constructed from wood and bicycle brake cables available at a workshop attached to a center for the deaf and blind where his father worked; the trio began performing at school parties and events. As teens, the trio often listened to a radio show hosted by popular Malagasy journalist and ethnomusicologist Latimer Rangers, who recorded, broadcast and promoted contemporary and traditional music from villages across Madagascar. Rangers also broadcast foreign artists who were relatively unknown to the Malagasy public, such as Bob Dylan, described <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> history of the protest song and other foreign genres, and drew connections between Malagasy musical styles and American Blues music, South African music and other genres.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{explanation}} for the "binding" process in programming languages. Current explanations [6] rely on a run-time search of an environment that consists of # ############ # pairs. The nature of this search and the ordering of the pairs are the critical factors in determining <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> scopes of <b>the</b> symbols. Instead of this, we propose explicit operations to perform "binding". Further, these operations are frequently performed at compile time, thus capturing the notion of early binding that characterizes most languages. The sequence in which these operations are performed replaces the previously mentioned searching as the determiner of <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> scopes of symbols...|$|R
