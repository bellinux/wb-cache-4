50|$|The air <b>turboramjet</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{combined}} cycle engine that merges aspects of turbojet and ramjet engines. The turboramjet is a hybrid engine that essentially consists of a turbojet mounted inside a ramjet. The turbojet core is mounted inside a duct that contains a combustion chamber downstream of the turbojet nozzle. The turboramjet can be run in turbojet mode at takeoff and during low-speed flight but then switch to ramjet mode to accelerate to high Mach numbers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turboramjet</b> <b>engine</b> is {{used when}} space is constrained, {{as it takes}} up less space than {{separate}} ramjet and turbojet engines. Since a ramjet must already be traveling at high speeds before it will start working, a ramjet-powered aircraft is incapable of taking off from a runway under its own power; that is {{the advantage of the}} turbojet, which {{is a member of the}} gas turbine family of engines. A turbojet does not rely purely on the motion of the engine to compress the incoming air flow; instead, the turbojet contains some additional rotating machinery that compresses incoming air and allows the engine to function during takeoff and at slow speeds. Independent single engine for all times is created by combination of these two to hybrid one.|$|E
40|$|An inlet {{concept for}} {{separate}} turbojet and ramjet engines was defined and {{compared with an}} equivalent inlet for a wraparound <b>turboramjet</b> <b>engine.</b> The comparison was made for a typical high altitude hypersonic cruise vehicle where the turbojet inlet capture area was required to be half {{as large as the}} ramjet inlet capture area at cruise. The use of a shorter nacelle having substantially lower cooling requirements at cruise for the inlet concept for separate turbojet and ramjet engines is suggested. The separate engine concept better isolates the turbojet from the ramjet, requires no special close off mechanisms within the turbojet, and avoids the circumferential heat load imposed by a wraparound ramjet. A more variable geometry is required...|$|E
50|$|<b>Turboramjet</b> <b>engines</b> have a {{transition}} from turbojet mode to ramjet mode as thrust-producing flow is transferred from the high pressure inner part to the low pressure outer part. During the transition the turbojet may have its fuel flow reduced as the ramjet parts take over thrust production. For example, in the Nord Griffon 02 the turbojet RPM was reduced to 90%.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turboramjet</b> <b>engines</b> may be {{classified}} {{according to the}} manner of energy transfer to the ramjet parts and whether they have a separate combustor. In the Griffon 02 power plant the turbojet was separate from the ram duct, which had its own combustor, {{and there was no}} energy transfer. In the J58 there was energy transfer from the gas generator to the bypass flow (from the compressor) and to the afterburner (from the turbine exhaust).|$|R
50|$|Not much {{information}} is available apart from the statement that such an aircraft is planned for development, no official data is available as to the planes capabilities.It is speculated {{that it will not}} enter service until at least mid-2020s. As an interceptor, its primary mission is rumored to offset future reconnaissance aircraft currently being developed by the United States of America and China.To achieve the high speeds rumored for the aircraft, the aircraft would need to be equipped with ramjet- or <b>turboramjet</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
