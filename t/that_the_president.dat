5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Zersenay {{returned}} to Eritrea and trained {{for one month}} {{to prepare for the}} 2008 World Half Marathon Championships in Rio de Janeiro. He won his third consecutive title over the half marathon distance with ease, taking the lead early on and beating the second-placed Patrick Makau Musyoki by almost two minutes. His success caused much celebration in his home country, so much so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Eritrea greeted him at the airport upon his return. With a strong history in the half marathon, Zersenay announced he would try the full marathon distance the following season.|$|E
50|$|Gaddafi reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> {{acceptance}} of <b>the</b> original terms is not acceptable. One of Gaddafi's own ministers protests that America has capitulated.

5|$|As in the United Kingdom and in {{a number}} of Commonwealth countries, Members of Parliament (MPs) may be {{appointed}} as Ministers of State to aid Ministers in the performance of their functions.

Such office holders are not regarded as members of the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Chapter Four {{lists the}} powers and {{duties of the}} Parliament of Belarus, which is called the National Assembly. The National Assembly itself {{is divided into two}} houses: the lower House of Representatives and the upper Council of the Republic.

5000|$|When the {{majority}} of the Assembly has opposite political views to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> this leads to political cohabitation.

5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> should be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E

Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern.

5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|In {{his speech}} on 1February2011 he said:"This dear nation... is where I lived, I fought {{for it and}} defended its soil, {{sovereignty}} and interests. On its soil I will die. History will judge me like it did others.". Crowds continued protesting in Tahrir Square, demanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> step down. There were reports that Mubarak's proclamation came after President Barack Obama's special envoy, Frank G. Wisner, told Mubarak the U.S. saw his presidency at an end and urged him to prepare for an orderly transition to real democracy. In the past, Mubarak had said {{he would continue to}} serve Egypt until his last breath.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
50|$|Adams was a {{supported}} {{of limited}} presidential terms, {{well before the}} 22nd Amendment passed, and advocated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidents</b> {{should be required to}} renounce political parties and that after they left the presidency, should be made ex-officio members of the United States Senate.|$|R
40|$|Community {{college leaders}} serve as linchpins for framing meaning on campus. The current {{pressures}} on institutions (given declining financial resources, demands for accountability, changing faculty ranks, and societal {{need for new}} knowledge) require presidents to juggle multiple priorities while presenting a cohesive message to campus constituents. This study examined how <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> at nine community colleges communicated with college constituents and framed the meaning of those communi-cations to help the college community make sense of ongoing change. Interviews with <b>the</b> <b>presidents,</b> {{as well as with}} key administrators, faculty members, and staff members, revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> used emissaries to disseminate information in four distinct ways. Study findings also showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> framed <b>the</b> meaning of their communications through visionary framing (emphasizing future possibilities), step-by-step framing (emphasizing the immediate next steps required to achieve institutional goals), or connective framing (emphasizing dialogue and collaborative learning).
