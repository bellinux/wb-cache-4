5|$|The Jabala Upanishad is {{an ancient}} text, {{composed}} before 300 CE. It is among the oldest Upanishads that discuss the subject of renouncing the worldly life for the exclusive pursuit of spiritual knowledge. The text discusses the city of Banaras in spiritual terms, as Avimuktam. It describes how that city became holy, <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> that the holiest place to revere is one within – the Atman (soul, self).|$|E

On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E

500|$|Maya {{inscriptions}} occasionally mention predicted {{future events}} or commemorations that would occur on dates {{far beyond the}} completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of [...] "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler K'inich Janaab' Pakal. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, [...] ) and <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it, arriving at a date of 21 October 4772AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.|$|E
500|$|American rapper B.o.B is {{featured}} on an official remix of [...] "Blow" [...] that was released to iTunes on May 17, 2011. B.o.B opens the track with a minute-long rapped verse about himself <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> to the song's dominant party theme, rapping: [...] "Night starts {{out at the}} ATM / It probably won’t end til 8 am." [...] Following this verse Kesha proclaims [...] "We are taking over", before the track resumes as it normally would without B.o.B's addition. Scott Shetler from PopCrush criticized the remix for not technically being a remix, rather being just the original song with added verses. Shetler wrote [...] "the term 'remix' makes us imagine all the ways the song could be creatively re-arranged. And a fun song like ‘Blow,’ with its brash lyrics and skittering beat, holds endless remix possibilities. But this version doesn’t substantially improve the original." [...] He went on to give the song {{three and a half}} stars out of a possible five.|$|E
500|$|Hudgens {{received}} {{an amount of}} praise from reviewers, emphasizing her transition from being associated with her previous commercial character, Gabriella Montez, multiple times. Reviewers also cited her impressive performance in the film. Even though Connell and Michalka each received their fair amount of enthusiastic press, David Waddington of North Wales Pioneer claims that Hudgens [...] "outshines {{the rest of the}} cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected." [...] Hudgens was praised with her performance in the film that The Observer critic, Philip French said that she looks like the young Thandie Newton and [...] "wisecracks like Dorothy Parker." [...] French <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> that [...] "Bandslam is a witty, touching, cleverly plotted film with excellent music." [...] Eye Weekly reviewer Will Sloan says, [...] "Bandslam is like a teenybopper version of Adventureland, and if its PG limitations keep it from being quite as insightful or funny as that film, it's still a serviceable, surprisingly intelligent bit of tweenertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{recalls the}} commandment, [...] "You shall not kill" [...] and <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> to it the proscriptions against anger, hatred and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to love their enemies. The Catechism asserts that [...] "it is {{legitimate}} {{to insist on}} respect for one's own right to life." [...] Kreeft says, [...] "self-defense is legitimate {{for the same reason}} suicide is not: because one's own life is a gift from God, a treasure we are responsible for preserving and defending." [...] The Catechism teaches that [...] "someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow." [...] Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.|$|E
500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E
500|$|A second, {{possibly}} pre-12th-century {{allusion to}} the Cædmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the Old Saxon Heliand poem. These texts, the Praefatio (Preface) and Versus de Poeta (Lines about the poet), explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation (for which the Heliand is the only known candidate) in language strongly reminiscent of, and indeed at times identical to, Bede's account of Cædmon's career. [...] According to the prose Praefatio, the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor Louis the Pious; the text <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until {{he was ordered to}} translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream. The Versus de Poeta contain an expanded account of the dream itself, adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself had come through the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle. While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th-century edition by Flacius Illyricus, both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition. [...] This apparent debt to the Cædmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Anglo Saxon biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{rectangular}} {{shape of}} Bart's head {{is described by}} director Mark Kirkland as a coffee can. Homer's head is also rectangular (with a dome on top), while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie. Different animators have different methods of drawing Bart. Former director Jeffrey Lynch starts off with a box, <b>then</b> <b>adds</b> the eyes, then the mouth, then the hair spikes, ear, {{and then the rest}} of the body. Matt Groening normally starts with the eyes, then the nose, {{and the rest of the}} outline of Bart's head. Many of the animators have trouble drawing Bart's spikes evenly; one trick they use is to draw one on the right, one on the left, one in the middle, then continue to add one in the middle of the blank space until there are nine. Originally, whenever Bart was to be drawn from an angle looking down so the top of his head was seen, Groening wanted there to be spikes along the outline of his head, and in the middle as well. Instead, Wes Archer and David Silverman drew him so that there was an outline of the spikes, then just a smooth patch in the middle because [...] "it worked graphically." [...] In [...] "The Blue and the Gray", Bart (along with Lisa and Maggie) finally questions why his hair has no visible border to separate head from hair.|$|E
