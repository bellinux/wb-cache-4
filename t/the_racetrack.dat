5|$|In 1954, William E. Miller {{died from}} a heart attack while driving a horse at Harrington Raceway. After Miller's death, Rosecroft hosted the William E. Miller Memorial race. Over the years, this race {{attracted}} several notable horses, including Cam's Card Shark, the 1994 Horse of the Year. John W. Miller, William's son, owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969. In 1961, the owners of Rosecroft resurfaced and regraded the track. Following John, Earle Brown owned <b>the</b> <b>racetrack.</b> John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, started to work at Rosecroft in 1974. Earle Brown moved to a different position at <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> in 1980 and William E. Miller II, William E. Miller's grandson, took over operations.|$|E
5|$|As a sire, he was {{the first}} All American Futurity winner to sire an All American Futurity winner, and went on to sire three winners of that race, and nine Champion Quarter Running Horses. Ultimately, his {{ownership}} and breeding rights were split into 60shares worth $500,000 each—a total of $30million. By 1993, the year after his death, his foals had earned more than $25million on <b>the</b> <b>racetrack.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist {{to help make the}} transition from <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses.|$|E

5|$|Springbok (1870–1897) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won {{the seventh}} Belmont Stakes in 1873. Foaled in 1870, he was sired by the {{imported}} stallion Australian, his dam was a daughter of Lexington. During his racing career he started 25 races, winning 17 of them. Besides the Belmont, Springbok won the Saratoga Cup twice, in 1874 and 1875 and was named Champion Older Male horse in 1874 and 1875. After retiring from <b>the</b> <b>racetrack,</b> he sired five stakes winners and died in 1897.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1995, Rosecroft {{was forced}} to cut costs. Its owners lowered the amount of purse money, {{eliminated}} stake races, and {{reduced the number of}} racing days. They decided to sell both Rosecroft and Ocean Downs to Cloverleaf Enterprises, a horseman's organization, in mid-1995 for $11 million. Weisman's Colt Enterprises reported that if <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> could not be sold, the company would have to file for bankruptcy. Cloverleaf accepted a $10.6 million loan from Bally Entertainment in hopes that a casino would be allowed at Rosecroft.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the station}} had 27,004 entries, making the station among the system's least-used. This {{amounted}} to only 52 boardings per weekday in 2009, representing a 71.6 percent decrease from the station's 1990 ridership. In 2010, there were 29,644 recorded entries, and in 2011, there were 54,183 entries. Since {{the station was}} closed through 2012, there were no boardings, but after full-time service was restored to the station in 2013, there was a significantly higher ridership, with 213,601 recorded entries in 2013 and 630,644 entries in 2014. The increase in ridership at the station and the nearby Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station since 2010 {{has been attributed to}} the end of off-track betting at <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> in 2010, and the opening of the casino in 2011.|$|E
50|$|During {{this time}} he had opposed the state's license plate design that {{included}} a representation of steeples from Churchill Downs because of <b>the</b> <b>racetrack's</b> association with gambling.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} bill to allow New York State racetracks to have video lottery {{terminals}} (VLTs) inside <b>the</b> <b>racetracks,</b> making them “racinos”.|$|R
50|$|Inaugurated in 1979 at <b>the</b> Fort Erie <b>Racetrack,</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} {{year it was}} moved to <b>the</b> Woodbine <b>Racetrack.</b> It remained there through 1993 {{and then returned to}} Fort Erie for the 1994 running. Since 1995 it has been at the Woodbine facility.|$|R
5|$|In September 1994, Weisman {{died from}} {{pancreatic}} cancer in Los Angeles, and his relatives took over <b>the</b> <b>racetrack.</b> Although attendance and handle were increasing, the owners were losing money. Reports by independent auditors stated Rosecroft and Ocean Downs combined to lose $1.1 million {{in fiscal year}} (FY) 1992, $1.4 million in FY 1993, and $6.2 million in FY 1994. According to Rosecroft's racing official Allan Levey, Weisman's relatives {{did not want to}} operate the track and their only goal was to sell it. For the 1995 season, Rosecroft could not afford the payment to host five stake races—including the Messenger Stakes—and dropped them from the racing schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on <b>the</b> <b>racetrack,</b> while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. <b>The</b> <b>racetrack</b> can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player down. There is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Dallas and Alfreda Jones {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>racetracks</b> {{and began}} hosting national drag racing events {{sanctioned by the}} National Hot Rod Association. <b>The</b> <b>racetracks</b> did well, and three years later, the couple purchased {{the rest of the}} park, which had by then fallen back into nature. No work was done on the old park until the 1990s, when the Jones' began to clear out the park and renovate the campground. The pool was then reopened, and the owners gradually added amusement rides back to the park — much as Charles Garvin had done in the park's early years.|$|R
50|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>racetrack's</b> website, for fans, {{the most}} popular winner of the race was the Canadian and American Hall of Fame filly Dance Smartly {{who went on to}} win the 1991 Triple Crown.|$|R
50|$|The renovation, first {{effective}} for the 2006 spring meeting, was heavily criticized by racegoers and commentators, {{who felt that}} the new racino laid its emphasis entirely on the casino part, destroying <b>the</b> <b>racetrack's</b> atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|In 1955, the New York Racing Association {{chose to}} upgrade Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park {{in part because}} of its {{proximity}} to the Rockaway Beach Branch. As part of the modernization of <b>the</b> <b>racetrack,</b> the Racing Association built a station with ramps leading directly to the track and facilities that could handle racetrack crowds. Once the work was finished, it was handed over to the city. The new station was for northbound trains to Brooklyn and Manhattan, and it was built north of the existing Aqueduct station. In order to allow for the switching maneuvers required for southbound trains to stop at the station, major signal changes were made on the line. The single-platform station was built by Aqueduct Racetrack owners at the cost of $1 million. The Aqueduct Racetrack station opened on September 14, 1959, on the same date as the renovated Aqueduct Racetrack.|$|E
5|$|Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers {{failed to}} finish the race, six of them because of {{accidents}} including Kubica. Four of them gearbox failures. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a groundhog on <b>the</b> <b>racetrack.</b> This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars {{were on the same}} lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all of the incidents and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably. Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.|$|E
5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{last year}} on <b>the</b> <b>racetracks</b> gave a total of US$168,227 in six races and one win. Her total {{earnings}} during her racing career were US$2,963,019, making her the richest Swedish mare trotter ever.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin F. Lindheimer {{purchased}} Washington Park Race Track in 1935 {{and owned}} it {{until his death}} in 1960. Long involved with the business, adopted daughter Marjorie Lindheimer Everett then took over management of <b>the</b> <b>racetracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>racetrack's</b> glory days, <b>the</b> Coliseum {{housed a}} cinema-sized screen and betting windows {{to handle the}} {{overflow}} of fans. In the mid-1980s, Ak-Sar-Ben was tenth in <b>the</b> nation in <b>racetrack</b> attendance, with up to 25,000 betting $2 million per day on weekends. Many festivals were also held in the Coliseum annually, including a Greek Festival and River City Roundup booths.|$|R
5|$|Throughout Rosecroft's history, it has {{featured}} notable races. From 1984 to 1988, it hosted {{segments of}} the Breeders Crown. Starting in 1990 and ending in 1995, <b>the</b> <b>racetrack</b> hosted the Messenger Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Rosecroft hosted the Potomac Stakes, Maryland most successful harness race, from 1990 to 1992. Rosecroft features the Maryland Sire Stakes, which showcases the best standardbred horses in Maryland. Besides the races, Rosecroft has had famous people and horses work and race at the track. John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, has been working at Rosecroft since 1974. Several famous people—Lyndon B. Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Nancy Pelosi, among others—have visited Rosecroft. Cam's Card Shark raced at Rosecroft in 1994 and challenged the single-season record for most money won in a season by winning over $2 million, and Robust Hanover set a track record while winning the Breeders Crown in 1985.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} to stud full-time, {{he had a}} {{very successful}} career. He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses already mentioned, the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and Megahertz. His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various points in time, Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth. As a broodmare sire, or maternal grandsire, of racehorses, Easy Jet led the All-time leading lists by winners in March 2008, and the same list ordered by earnings had him second. As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on <b>the</b> <b>racetrack.</b> In total, he sired 2,507foals in 25years of breeding.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>racetracks</b> and <b>the</b> racing {{associations}} award championships {{as determined}} by the guidelines of the associated rulebooks. Awards, usually for the top ten racers in each class, may include a trophy, a jacket, and a monetary amount.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, a new one-mile (1.6 km) racing strip {{was built}} around the {{existing}} 5/8's mile oval. But in 1991, the Illinois Racing Board took away <b>the</b> <b>racetrack's</b> thoroughbred dates, making Balmoral Park an exclusive harness racing facility.|$|R
50|$|Just a {{few days}} after the disaster, the {{newspapers}} lost interest in the Paris-Madrid race. The sport pages were all about another race, at <b>the</b> Ardennes <b>racetrack</b> <b>the</b> following June 22.|$|R
