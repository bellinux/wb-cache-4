5|$|Taft's ruling had {{no bearing}} on the cases of Governor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall except to spell out a means {{for them to take}} their cases to the federal courts, if necessary. On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor filed suit in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham filed suit against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court â€“ a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also filed suit against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E

The ship met her end when she was scuttled, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> falling into British hands. The wreck of Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929.|$|E

Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some parking meters as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E

We confiscated illegal traps and nets, the {{materials}} of which had cost them considerable sums and the making of which required weeks of labor. We <b>prevented</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> catching fish at many times and seasons, which was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> making as good a living as they might have made had we not been in existence. And when we captured them, they were brought into the courts of law, where heavy cash fines were collected <b>from</b> <b>them.</b> As a result, they hated us vindictively. As the dog is the natural enemy of the cat, the snake of man, so were we of the fish patrol the natural enemies of the fishermen.|$|R
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being stolen.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Powell {{was made}} a baronet by Charles II. Although it is {{unrecorded}} when Bodiam Castle was dismantled (slighted), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, {{and in some cases}} care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the barbican, the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

Towards all this adding and capacity, communication and coordination with the subjects of culture, protection and rescue, crisis management and others those involved in this issue with a responsible and effective implementation of the necessary measures <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> and deal with assessed risks and hazards will enable more efficient protection and rescue of archaeological sites in case of their occurrence...|$|R
5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> acquiring it.|$|E

He spent more than two years with League Two side Rochdale, before joining Boston United in the January transfer window of 2007. Boston United were reduced to just 12 professionals on their books in the closing stages of the 2006â€“07 season, as the club could not afford to pay players wages. Cooksey had not been paid since February, and was spending Â£30 a day in fuel travelling from his Manchester home. He spent six months at Boston United and played 16 League Two games, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being relegated from The Football League {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction.

5000|$|Some {{argue that}} {{deterrence}} {{is the key}} to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> developing nuclear weapons. Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, a supporter of the agreement, wrote {{it would be better to}} have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, [...] "provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb". According to Michael Eisenstadt, Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, [...] "deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years".|$|R
60|$|Within an {{hour the}} {{position}} had grown very serious indeed, {{so much so}} that we found it necessary to consider what should be done. I pointed out that with our small number a charge against the scattered riflemen, who were gradually surrounding us, would be worse than useless, while it was almost hopeless to expect to hold the boma till nightfall. Once the Arabs got behind us, they could rake us from the higher ground. Indeed, for the last half-hour we had directed all our efforts <b>to</b> <b>preventing</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> passing this boma, which, fortunately, the stream on the one side and a stretch of quite open land on the other made it very difficult for them to do without more loss than they cared to face.|$|R
