60|$|At Rampore I {{found the}} {{temperature}} of the ground, at three feet depth, varied from 87.8 degrees to 89.8 degrees, being considerably lower than that of the air (94.2 degrees), whilst that of a fine ripening shaddock, into which I plunged a <b>thermometer</b> <b>bulb,</b> varied little from 81 degrees, whether the sun shone on it or not. From this place we made very slow progress south-eastwards, with a gentle current, but against constant easterly winds, and often violent gales and thunder-storms, which obliged us to bring up under shelter of banks and islands of sand. Sometimes we sailed along the broad river, whose opposite shores were rarely both visible at once, and at others tracked the boat through narrow creeks that unite the many Himalayan streams, and form a network soon after leaving their mountain valleys.|$|E

50|$|The {{psychrometers}} were a wet bulb-dry <b>bulb</b> pair of <b>thermometers.</b> The moisture evaporating {{from the}} wet fabric on one bulb cooled it, {{the lower the}} humidity the lower the temperature. By comparing the two temperatures, {{it was possible to}} calculate the relative humidity. The thermometers were inside the nose of the airplane. Air was trapped by probes attached to the outside and directed in over the <b>thermometer</b> <b>bulbs.</b> When the psychrometer was first tried in the airplanes, the readings were inaccurate. It was found that when exposed to an airstream moving over 200 mph, the friction of the air heated the thermometers. The amount of heating was unpredictable, making it impossible to calculate a correction. New psychrometers were developed that slowed the air before making the readings. With these devices, accuracy was 98-99%.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of evaluating the use of concrete or hard-packed dirt floor in broiler houses. This experiment was carried out in two different phases. The following performance parameters were studied: live weight, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and mortality. Litter moisture, pH and temperature were measured. Litter residual contamination after cleaning and disinfection was also evaluated. A dry <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> a wet <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and a black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> were placed inside each broiler house at bird height and outside the broiler house for data collection. Environmental data were collected at 3 h intervals from 00 : 00 to 24 : 00 hours during weeks 4, 5, and 6 of the grow-out. Based on the collected data, air relative humidity (RH) was determined, after which wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL) were calculated. There were no differences in live performance parameters. However, total mortality and sudden death were higher in birds raised on dirt floor. On days 0, 14 and 35, litter pH was higher in the dirt floor as compared to the concrete floor, {{but at the end of}} the grow-out, this difference disappeared. There was a cubic effect of bird age on litter moisture, which increased up to day 28, and then stabilized or decreased. Litter coliform contamination was higher at the end of the grow-out as compared to that found at housing, but it was not influenced by floor type. The general thermal comfort of broiler raised on dirt floor was similar to that of broilers raised on concrete floor...|$|R

60|$|The top gained, a {{space was}} quickly {{selected}} and cleared, {{and a simple}} hut of flat stones begun, while the Captain unpacked his box. It contained a barometer, a maximum and minimum self-registering thermometer, wet and dry bulb, also a black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> a one-eighth-inch rain-gauge, and several other instruments.|$|R
60|$|These {{observations}} {{were taken by}} burying a brass tube two feet six inches to three feet deep, in exposed soil, and sinking in it, by a string or tied to a slip of wood, a <b>thermometer</b> whose <b>bulb</b> was well padded with wool: this, after a few hours' rest, indicates {{the temperature of the}} soil. Such a tube and thermometer I usually caused to be sunk wherever I halted, if even for one night, except {{during the height of the}} rains, which are so heavy that they communicate to the earth a temperature considerably above that of the air.|$|R
50|$|To use the <b>thermometer,</b> the <b>bulb</b> {{is placed}} in the {{location}} where the temperature is to be measured and left long enough to be certain to reach thermal equilibrium—typically three minutes. Maximum-reading is achieved by means of a constriction in the neck close to the bulb. As the temperature of the bulb rises, the liquid expands up the tube through the constriction. When the temperature falls, the column of liquid breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. After reading the value, the thermometer must be reset by repeatedly swinging it sharply to shake the liquid back through the constriction.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} morning the temperature was 28 degrees at 6.30 a.m., and rose to 30 degrees when the sun appeared over the mountains at 8.15, at which time the black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> suddenly mounted to 112 degrees, upwards of 80 degrees above {{the temperature of the}} air. The sky was brilliantly clear, with a very dry, cold, north wind blowing down the snowy valley of the pass.|$|R

60|$|The mean {{temperature}} of the twenty-four hours was 32.7 degrees (max. 41.5 degrees/min. 27.2 degrees), mean dew-point 29.7, and saturation 0.82. The mercury suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset; and from early morning the radiation was so powerful, that a thermometer exposed on snow sank to 21.2 degrees, and stood at 25.5 degrees, at 10 a.m. The black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> rose to 132 degrees, at 9 a.m. on the 27th, or 94.2 degrees above the {{temperature of the}} air in the shade. I did not then observe that of radiation from snow; but if, as we may assume, it was not less than on the following morning (21.2 degrees), we shall have a difference of 148.6 degrees Fahr., in contiguous spots; the one exposed to the full effects of the sun, the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium to a cloudless sky. On the 28th the black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> freely suspended over the snow and exposed to the sun, rose to 108 degrees, or 78 degrees above that of the air in the shade (32 degrees); the radiating surface of the same snow in the shade being 21.2 degrees, or 86.8 degrees colder.|$|R
30|$|EXAMPLE 2 : A {{digital camera}} returns an image (Observation), with a spatial {{receptive}} field {{equal to the}} size of the aperture and a temporal receptive window equal to the shutter speed. The aperture is “the size of the adjustable opening inside the lens, which determines how much light passes through the lens to strike the image sensor” [64], and the shutter speed is “the amount of time the digital camera’s shutter remains open when capturing a photograph” [65]. The receptor of the camera is the image sensor, but the size of the aperture determines the actual portion of the image sensor that is stimulated during the production of an image. The shutter speed determines the duration of the image sensor’s exposure to light. It is acknowledged here that resolution has been defined in the literature (for example, [66]) as a function of imaging aperture and the wavelength of the light. This is the optical resolution (which has sometimes also been called spatial resolution). It is inversely correlated with aperture, and measures the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer. However, in line with previous work [5, 67], the term ‘discrimination’ is reserved for the shortest distance between two points on an image that can still be distinguished by the observer (the optical resolution). Approximating spatial resolution (as defined in this work, see Section Introduction) with spatial receptive field intends to inform about a different notion, and tell instead about the portion of the observer which was stimulated while producing the observation. It also reflects intuition, namely: the larger the aperture, the smaller the optical resolution (smallest details the lens can resolve), and consequently the larger the amount of spatial detail in the final image (spatial resolution). Further examples of receptors for technical observers include thermistors (for medical digital <b>thermometers),</b> <b>bulbs</b> (for clinical mercury thermometers), telescopes (for laser altimeters), aneroid capsules (for pressure altimeters), bulbs (for psychrometers), to name a few.|$|R

Before leaving, I measured by angles and a base-line the elevations of the great village-terrace above the river, and that of a loftier one, on the west flank of the main valley; the former was about 400 and the latter 700 feet.|$|R
2500|$|The use {{of mercury}} in dental {{fillings}} is considered {{safe and effective}} in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced legislation to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam {{is part of a}} larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, <b>thermometers,</b> light <b>bulbs,</b> sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations [...] "Minamata Convention on Mercury". Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices (which will be banned by the year 2020), the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).|$|R

In the present communication are presented the records of electrical potentials obtained during the depression of body temperature and its return to higher levels, together with observations on some physiological concomitants of the process. Material and Methods The methods used in securing and recording the data on potentials were, in general, similar to those described in the previous paper. Leads were taken from the nape of the neck and the dorsum of the sacrum of the mice by means of saline bridges connected with silver-silver chloride electrodes. The magnitudes of the potential differences were continuously and automatically indicated by a Burr, Lane, Nims microvoltmeter operating a photo-electric recording galvanometer. On a second similar recording galvanometer were obtained simultaneous, continuous, graphic readings of the internal temperature of the mouse as detected by a copper-constantin thermocouple. The thermocouple was inserted into the rectum of the mouse for a distance of 2 to 3 centimeters, so that only the insulated portions of the wires were exposed.

50|$|In {{very dry}} climates, {{evaporative}} coolers, {{sometimes referred to}} as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.|$|R
