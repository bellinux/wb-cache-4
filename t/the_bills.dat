5|$|The Patriots and <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards <b>the</b> <b>Bills,</b> Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> (in earlier times, the entire text of <b>the</b> <b>bills).</b> The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
50|$|If the King {{does not}} grant assent to <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> he returns <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> with {{amendments}} or objections for Parliament to deliberate and vote on <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{in a joint}} sitting. After Parliament deliberates and passes <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> in a joint sitting, Parliament resubmits <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to <b>the</b> Druk Gyalpo who must then grant assent to <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are eleven Utah Senate {{standing}} committees and fifteen Utah House of Representatives {{standing committees}}.

50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the interpretation clause, {{the main body}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> objects and reasons. The long title is a description of the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and covers <b>the</b> intent of <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> Short title follows the long title and labels <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> for identification purposes. The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> will have legal force. The short title in turn is followed by the interpretation clause, which defines certain words and phrases used in <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> body of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> {{consists of}} all of the other clauses, which contain the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> that is, they contain all of the measures that <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is enacting. <b>The</b> objects and reasons is the final part of a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> reason why it is necessary.|$|R
5|$|Helped by Gilchrist's {{running and}} quarterback Kemp's passing, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{finished}} the 1964 {{season with a}} 12–2 record and won the AFL championship. The team won despite drama involving Gilchrist, who came into conflict with Saban frequently and asked to be traded on numerous occasions. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> released him on waivers in November 1964, but canceled the move when Gilchrist apologized. After the 1964 AFL championship win over the Chargers, Saban was named the league's coach of the year.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 4yard line, but were unable to score and {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> began one final drive. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> {{posted a}} 7–6–1 record again in 1963, {{but this time}} it was enough to tie with the Patriots for {{the best record in the}} eastern {{division}}.

When <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> reached <b>the</b> senate, Reid added substantial provisions on unemployment, renaming <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>the</b> Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> passed <b>the</b> Senate with the new unemployment language. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> was passed into law as Carl Levin and Howard P.

5|$|Gilchrist {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> {{continued}} to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship {{for the second year in}} a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was not a good play-caller.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{won their}} seventh {{game in a}} row against <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> in Cleveland.

Motley fumbled on the Browns' next possession, however, and <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> capitalized on the mistake. After several running plays brought {{the ball to the}} Browns' 22-yard line, quarterback Jim Still threw to Al Baldwin for a touchdown that evened the score. A Groza field goal and a short touchdown run by Motley later in the first quarter put the Browns up by 10 points at halftime. Cleveland retained the lead {{for the rest of the}} game as end Mac Speedie caught touchdown passes in the third and fourth quarters. Graham ended the game with 11 completions for 189 yards and two touchdowns. Speedie, who was leading the league in receiving, added seven receptions for 140 yards. While <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> lost, second-string quarterback George Ratterman, who came in for Still in the second quarter, put in a strong performance, completing 13 passes for 174 yards. His totals included a touchdown throw to Lou Tomasetti in the fourth quarter, when the game was out of reach.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reach of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights (beneficiaries, duties, time and territory) {{demarcates}} {{the types of}} legal disputes to which <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights directly applies.

In addition, and subject to considerations of justiciability and jurisdiction, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights generates {{its own set of}} remedies.

50|$|Once the Parliament {{agrees to}} the general {{principles}} of a <b>Bill,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> progresses to Stage 2. In this stage, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> may be referred back to the lead committee designated in Stage 1, or may be transferred {{to one or more}} other committees. Occasionally, a Bill is transferred to a committee of the entire Scottish Parliament. <b>The</b> committees <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is referred to then cover <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> in detail, and must agree on each individual portion (in contrast to Stage 1, where only the general idea of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> must be agreed on).

50|$|Once a {{bill has}} been {{approved}} in two debates in each house, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{is sent to the}} government (President) for its approval. While the Colombian President, unlike in the United States, formally lacks veto power, he/she may object to a bill and return it to the houses for second debates. The delay for returning a bill with objections is 6 days (no more than 20 articles in <b>the</b> <b>bill),</b> 10 days (21-50 articles) or 20 days (over 50 articles). If the prescribed delay expires without the government having returned <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> with its objections, the President shall approve and promulgate it. If <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> is again adopted by an absolute majority of the members of both houses, the President must sign <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> without objection. However, if the President objected to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for unconstitutionality, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> will be sent, if the houses insist, to the Constitutional Court. The Court then has six days to rule on <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> constitutionality; a favourable ruling forces the President to sign <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> an unfavourable decision defeats <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R
