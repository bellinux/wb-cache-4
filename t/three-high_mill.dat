50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high non-reversing, which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The two-high reversing mill has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to rolling speed between each pass. To resolve this, the <b>three-high</b> <b>mill</b> was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair. The disadvantage to this system is the workpiece must be lifted and lowered using an elevator. All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Bimetallic bars which possess higher {{corrosion}} resistance and mechanical properties, {{it is the}} newkind of bimetallic bars which are better than standard bars. The bimetallic bars are more often applied in concreteconstruction. There are few methods which ensure a good strength of bimetallic layer bond. Hydrostatic extrusion,rotary rolling and explosive cladding are most often used methods. Design/methodology/approach: The simulations of the bar rolling in a <b>three-high</b> skew <b>mill</b> were carriedout using the Forge 2005 ® commercial program. Findings: The higher value of yield stress of the cladding layer does not produce the effect of “flowing down” ofthis layer over the core surface and it’s folding between the rolls. The use of non-corrosive steel on plating layerassures receipt on a high durability and esthetics bimetallic bars. Practical implications: Bimetallic bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of concreteconstructions, and as working elements in bridge building in aggressive environment. Originality/value: Production of bimetallic bars is very difficult. One from many problems during productionbimetallic bars is assurance good strength of bimetallic layer bond. A theoretical analysis of bimetallic bar rollingin a <b>three-high</b> skew <b>mill</b> {{is presented in the}} paper and the distributions of stress and strain intensities in thebimetallic bar during skew rolling are shown...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{of round}} bars rolling on a <b>three-high</b> skew rolling <b>mills</b> allows rolling of {{standard}} {{materials such as}} steel and aluminum, {{as well as new}} materials, especially hard deformable materials. The paper presents the results of theoretical and experimental rolling process of aluminum bars with a diameter of 20 mm. As the stock round bars with a diameter of 25 mm made of aluminum grade 1050 A and aluminum alloy grade 2017 A were used. The rolling process of aluminum bars has been carried out in a single pass. The numerical analysis was carried out by using computer program Forge 2011 ®. On the basis of theoretical research it has been determined the state of deformation, stress and temperature distribution during rolling of aluminum bars. In addition, the results of theoretical research allowed to determine the schema of the metal plastic flow in the roll gap. Verification of the theoretical research was carried out during the rolling of aluminum bars on the RSP 40 / 14 laboratory <b>three-high</b> skew rolling <b>mill.</b> From the finished bars were taken the samples to set the shape and compared with the results of theoretical research.

40|$|When using continuous-cast billet in pipe rolling, it is {{expedient}} to {{roll the}} billet prior to broaching, so as to improve the structure and properties of the steel. To that end, a <b>three-high</b> screw-rolling <b>mill</b> for billet reduction has been installed at the TPA- 80 pipe-rolling unit at OAO Sinarskii Trubnyi Zavod. Introduction of the new process was associated with increase in the rejection rate on account of indentations in the pipe. These indentations {{may be attributed to}} the depression formed {{at the rear of the}} billet in reduction and the subsequent formation of metallic semicircles on broaching; the semicircles break away and enter the deformation zone. The sources of the indentations on the rolled pipe are investigated. The broaching of the billet on a screw rolling mill is mathematically simulated. Recommendations are made with a view to reducing the surface defects on pipe produced by the TPA- 80 unit with a reduction mill. © 2013 Allerton Press, Inc...|$|R
50|$|No6 <b>Mill</b> was a <b>three-high</b> rolling <b>mill</b> {{with several}} stands (Sets of Rolls) {{producing}} bar down to thick wire sizes from red hot billets {{taken from the}} reheat furnaces. The small diameter rod and bar produced in this mill snaked all over the cast iron floor plates. The operators used tongs to catch hold {{of the end of}} the red hot bar as it left the rolls, passed the bar around their body allowing it to loop out onto the floor and then entered the bar into the next pass position. In one hot summer the floor plates expanded, the expansion could not go anywhere and two plates buckled upwards like flagstones directing the hot metal into the air - within milliseconds there was no one on the mill floor as the metal reared up towards the roof and collapsed in a writhing heap as the mill rollers continued to spew out the rest of the bar.|$|R
40|$|Currently {{magnesium}} alloy bars are manufactured {{mainly in the}} extrusion process. This method has some drawbacks, which include: low process capacity, considerable energy demand, small length of finished products. Therefore it is purposeful to develop efficient methods for manufacturing of Mg alloy products {{in the form of}} bars, such methods include groove rolling and three-high skew rolling processes. Modified stretching passes provide change in material plastic flow, which contributes to the occurrence of the better distribution of stress and strain state than in the case of rolling in classical stretching passes. One of the modern method of Mg alloy bars production is rolling in a <b>three-high</b> skew rolling <b>mill,</b> which allows to set in a single pass a larger deformation compared to the rolling in the stretching passes...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} two {{experiments to}} determine the effect of added glycerol or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability characteristics of ground corn or ground corn and 15 or 30 % spray-dried whey. Experiments were conducted using corn ground by either a full circle, tear drop hammer <b>mill</b> or a <b>three-high</b> roller <b>mill</b> at the Kansas State University Grain Science Feed Mill. Flow ability was determined by measuring angle of repose. In Exp. 1 we evaluated the effects of added soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability of ground corn. Samples were ground through a roller mill (RM) or hammermill (HM). Particle size mean and standard deviations of the ground corn were 645 microns and 1. 97 for the roller mill and 674 microns and 2. 31 for the hammer mill. Soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 blend of soy oil/glycerol was added to the ground corn at 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 % for a total of 30 samples (1 RM sample, 1 HM sample, 3 liquid sources, and 5 levels of added liquid). In Exp. 2, we evalu-ated the effects of added soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend on the flow ability of 85 : 15 or 70 : 30 blend of HM ground corn and spray-dried whey. Soy oil, glycerol, or a 50 : 50 blend of soy oil/glycerol was added to the ground corn and spray-dried whey-based diets at 0, 4, or 8 % for a total of 18 samples (1 HM sample, 2 levels of added whey, 3 liquid sources, and 3 levels of added liquid). Angle of repose was then measured, and replicated 4 times on each sample. In Exp. 1 there was a three way interaction (P< 0. 05) between mill type, liquid source, and percent liquid added. Roller mill ground grain had decreased angle of repose (better flow ability) compared to HM ground grain. The addition of soy oil increased angle of repose, decreasing flow ability. The addition of glycerol or a 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend decreased angle of repose, improving flow ability with HM ground corn. Addition of glycerol did not influence flow ability when added to RM corn ground. In Exp. 2 there was a three way interaction (P< 0. 05) between spray-dried whey level, added liquid source, and percent of liquid added. The addition of glycerol or the 50 : 50 soy oil/glycerol blend decreased angle of repose, improving flow ability. The addition of glycerol decreased angle of repose greater in the 15 % spray-dried whey sample compared to the 30 % spray-dried whey sample. The addition of soy oil increased angle of repose regardless of spray-dried whey concentration. These data suggest that the addition of glycerol to a meal diet containing HM ground corn will improve flow ability...|$|R
