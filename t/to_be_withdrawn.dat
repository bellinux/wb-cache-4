5|$|At 11 am a {{disturbance}} {{started in the}} chapel at Strangeways Prison when some 300 prisoners attacked staff. Those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then broke into the living accommodation in the main prison. Other prisoners, including those on remand, joined in the disturbance and staff had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The perimeter is secure.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> A number of other Commissioners also had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside, {{and placed}} {{the blame for the}} Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for {{requiring}} the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Florins (usually dated 1947 or later) {{remained}} in circulation after Decimal Day. In 1987, following {{a study of}} the currency, the Thatcher government announced its intent to issue a new ten pence piece, reduced in size. A smaller ten pence piece was issued in 1992, after which the old florin was demonetised on 30 June 1993. The florin, the first decimal coin, was the last coin in general circulation just prior to decimalisation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> {{from the region}} in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the class}} were loaned to the Great Western Railway between 1942 and 1944 to assist in bolstering freight power, of which there was an acute {{shortage}} on that railway during the Second World War. The class saw use after nationalisation in 1948, though with increasing numbers of Bulleid Pacifics able to take over their duties, the Remembrance class began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from service during the mid-1950s, starting with Hackworth in 1955, and finally Beattie in 1957. The early withdrawal {{of the class}} ensured that none were preserved.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} {{service from}} Cinderford <b>to</b> Drybrook <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from 7 July 1930.|$|R

5|$|The {{first annual}} {{training}} exercise was acronymed SAKA (SArdinien KAmpagne), first begun 3 January 1985. It {{was conducted at}} the Air Weapons Training Installation (AWTI) at Decimomannu Air Base on Sardinia, {{at the time the}} only such facility outside of the United States. Up to 18 Swiss Mirages and Tigers per year conducted air combat maneuvering training on its instrumentation range. Following its fifth SAKA exercise in 1989, however, demands by NATO air forces for the facility resulted in permission for Swiss Air Force usage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when Moltke, Bayern, and the Königs began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the Kaisers engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the {{objective was to}} secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the Gulf. Both Grosser Kurfürst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions; damage to the former was minimal, but Bayern was severely wounded; the ship had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> to Kiel for repairs.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the year, Dennis Dart East Lancs EL2000s 460 <b>to</b> 463 <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The L&YR built {{some special}} {{lightweight}} electric stock and from 1906 began running services from Dingle to [...] and Aintree. Regular services <b>to</b> Aintree <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1908, and after this special trains ran only twice a year, on Jump Sunday {{and the following}} Friday for the Grand National, both held at Aintree Racecourse. Through services from Dingle <b>to</b> Southport <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in 1914. By 1914 the railway had served over 10,000,000 passengers.|$|R

5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of its government protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of bankruptcy, it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). They {{were assigned}} to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in January 1991. With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes was lost in a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely {{because it would be}} excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from 12 September.|$|E
5|$|Bayern was {{commissioned}} {{midway through the}} war, and had a limited service career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea on 18–19 August 1916, a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga, but shortly after the German attack began on 12 October 1917, Bayern was mined and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> for repairs. She was interned {{with the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the end of World War I. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the fleet to be scuttled; Bayern sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised, towed to Rosyth, and scrapped.|$|E
50|$|Local {{services}} to Liverpool Street and all services <b>to</b> Stratford <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> in December 2011; however Stansted Express {{plans to introduce}} direct {{services to}} Stratford from 2019.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} {{service from}} Numurkah north <b>to</b> Cobram <b>was</b> <b>withdrawn</b> on 24 April 1981 but was restored on 14 August 1983. The service from Melbourne to Shepparton then <b>to</b> Cobram <b>was</b> again <b>withdrawn</b> on 21 August 1993, with Hoys Roadlines {{taking control of}} the train as far as Shepparton from 22 August, hiring locomotives, carriages and train crews from V/Line. This arrangement remained until 2004.|$|R
50|$|From 31 December 1916 the through {{carriages}} from Swansea <b>to</b> Birmingham <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn.</b> The transit <b>was</b> {{very slow}} and patronage had never <b>been</b> enough <b>to</b> justify the service.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the British intervened {{directly}} in 1883, the Mahdi had set about conquering much of Sudan, at the time controlled by Egypt, and had won several critical victories that provided him great wealth and modern weaponry. Colonel William Hicks, British officer appointed commander of eight-thousand Egyptian soldiers and an extensive supply train, was given the simple objective of crushing the insurrection. Colonel Hicks and nearly every man in his army was killed by an overwhelming Mahdist force at the Battle of El Obeid. After this defeat, and facing immense financial difficulties in Egypt, the British government decided not to pursue further offensive action and instead selected General Charles George Gordon to lead the evacuation effort, as thousands of civilians and pounds of equipment were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from outposts throughout Sudan.|$|E
5|$|During their peacetime careers, {{the vessels}} {{served in a}} variety of roles, {{including}} as survey vessels, training ships, fishery protection ships, and guard ships. Several of them were sent abroad, usually to the Mediterranean Sea on training cruises; during conflicts in Spain and the Ottoman Empire, these vessels were used to protect German nationals in those countries. Starting in 1872, the members of the class began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from service as their hulls began to deteriorate. Several of the ships were converted into storage hulks, while others were simply broken up {{or in the case of}} Meteor and Drache, sunk as target ships. Basilisk was the last surviving member of the class, remaining in use as a naval mine storage hulk until at least 1900; her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>withdrawn</b> once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
50|$|Passenger rail {{services}} from Echuca <b>to</b> Balranald <b>were</b> <b>withdrawn</b> on 7 November 1975, {{with the last}} train a 153hp Walker railmotor.
