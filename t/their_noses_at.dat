5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb <b>their</b> <b>noses</b> <b>at</b> England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
25|$|Dog salmon or {{chum salmon}} Oncorhynchus keta (iqalluk, aluyak, kangitneq, mac'utaq in Yup'ik, qavlunaq, neqpik in Cup'ik, mac'utar in Cup'ig) is second-largest of the Alaskan salmonids. In Alaska, chum salmon often called dog salmon {{due to their}} fierce {{dentition}} exhibited during spawning {{as well as the}} males tendency to bite and nip at each other. Salmon snobs of Alaska will often turn up <b>their</b> <b>noses</b> <b>at</b> chum salmons because they are thought to be only fit for dog food.|$|E
500|$|According to Sheffield, {{there was}} dissension {{initially}} among the orchestral musicians, {{some of whom}} [...] "were looking down <b>their</b> <b>noses</b> <b>at</b> the Beatles, I think". Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding: [...] "Do {{you guys want to}} get fucking paid or not?" [...] During the first few takes, McCartney was unhappy about the lack of energy and passion in the orchestra's performance, so he stood up on the grand piano and started conducting the musicians from there.|$|E

500|$|Private {{equity in}} the 1980s was a {{controversial}} topic, commonly associated with corporate raids, hostile takeovers, asset stripping, layoffs, plant closings and outsized profits to investors. [...] As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability. [...] Although in the 1980s, many of the acquisitions made were unsolicited and unwelcome, private equity firms in the 1990s focused on making buyouts attractive propositions for management and shareholders. [...] According to The Economist, “ig companies that would once have turned up <b>their</b> <b>noses</b> <b>at</b> an approach from a private-equity firm are now pleased {{to do business with}} them.” Additionally, private equity investors became increasingly focused on the long term development of companies they acquired, using less leverage in the acquisition. [...] In the 1980s leverage would routinely represent 85% to 95% of the purchase price of a company as compared to average debt levels between 20% and 40% in leveraged buyouts in the 1990s and {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. [...] KKR's 1986 acquisition of Safeway, for example, was completed with 97% leverage and 3% equity contributed by KKR, whereas KKR's acquisition of TXU in 2007 was completed with approximately 19% equity contributed ($8.5 billion of equity out of a total purchase price of $45 billion). [...] Additionally, private equity firms are more likely to make investments in capital expenditures and provide incentives for management to build long-term value.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down <b>their</b> <b>noses</b> <b>at</b> something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

5000|$|The rise of {{membership}} in the Texas Nationalist Movement coincided with other secession-related news events not part of that organization. Governor Rick Perry, at a political rally in 2009, addressed the possibility of secession. During the rally, many in the crowd began to chant [...] "secede, secede", to which Perry remarked, [...] "If Washington continues to thumb <b>their</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the American people, you know, who knows what might come out of that." [...] Perry subsequently clarified that the comment was tongue in cheek and {{that he does not}} support secession. His remarks sparked controversy and harsh criticism from government officials and pundits, such as Jeff Macke and Joe Weisental.|$|R
5000|$|On the day Schiavo died, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay {{criticized the}} legal system and said, [...] "The time will come for the men {{responsible}} judges for this to answer for their behavior."

[...] "We will look at an unaccountable, arrogant, out-of-control judiciary that thumbed <b>their</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> Congress and the president," [...] DeLay said. On April 14, 2005, DeLay {{held a news conference}} and issued an apology for the tone of his comments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if botulinum neurotoxin type-A (BoNT/A) had a preemptive antinociceptive effect in a formalin-induced orofacial pain model (FT).

Animals pre-treated with BoNT/A at the first protocol (8 days subgroup) showed reduced inflammatory scores (p= 0. 011). For the other groups no significant results were observed at any phase. Motor activity was similar in both groups. BoNT/A showed to be effective preventing inflammatory pain up to eight days after the first treatment, an effect not reproduced on the second dose administration...|$|R

5000|$|Relatively little {{happened}} during the summer, as Iranian internal politics took its course. In early July, the Iranians released hostage Richard Queen, who had developed multiple sclerosis. In the States, constant media coverage—yellow ribbons, footage of chanting Iranian mobs, even a whole new television news program, ABC's Nightline—provided a dispiriting backdrop to the presidential election season. As Carter advisor and biographer Peter Bourne put it, [...] "Because people felt that Carter had not been tough enough in foreign policy, this kind of symbolized for them that some bunch of students could seize American diplomatic officials and hold them prisoner and thumb <b>their</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the United States." [...] The death of the Shah on July 27 and the invasion of Iran by Iraq in September 1980 may have made Iran more receptive {{to the idea of}} resolving the hostage crisis. There was little more advantage to be gained from further anti-American, anti-Shah propaganda, and the ongoing sanctions were making it harder to straighten out an already chaotic economy.|$|R
