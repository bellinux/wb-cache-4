This will be carried out through the construction of a specialised Portal and a multilingual thesaurus for the social and educational dissemination of cultural, historic and natural heritage. We study cultural heritage and how it’s managed from a multidisciplinary point of view, employing the methods and procedures used in the human and social sciences, information technology and library science together with documentation. The research team will design the Dihèlia portal and the thesaurus {{through the use of a}} wide range of procedural activities.

40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} to holistic system modelling is presented, {{based on the}} Specification PEARL hardware/software co-design methodology, having its origin in the standard Multiprocessor PEARL specification language. Specification PEARL specifications and models represent prototypes of systems and programs, based on the PEARL program model. The system models built are checked for timely execution by co-simulation. <b>The</b> resulting <b>information</b> <b>shall</b> be used for fine-tuning the designs. Through the analysis of simulation traces a profiling process takes place. An integral CASE tool facilitating this holistic approach has also been devised. After the profiling process has produced a feasible system model, the program prototypes may be enhanced to their full functionality. As long as their timing properties are not changed by this, utilising this methodology should minimise the possibility of implementing an infeasible system.

40|$|Service {{discovery}} is vital in ubiquitous applications, where {{a large number}} of devices and software components collaborate unobtrusively and provide numerous services without user intervention.

Potentially, <b>the</b> context <b>information</b> of <b>the</b> users and surrounding environment can be used {{to improve the quality of}} service matching. To make use of context information in service matching, a service discovery technique needs to address certain challenges.

From time to time <b>the</b> amount of <b>information</b> exceed <b>the</b> capacity of the driver, and this increases the risk of an accident. Volvo Car Corporation wanted to find of if the driver’s situation, and safety, could be helped by presenting some information in a higher position than today, above the steering wheel. It was of interest to see what kind of visual <b>information</b> would benefit <b>the</b> most from this position and how <b>the</b> <b>information</b> should be designed. Two technical solutions where evaluated: one display with perceived depth, ‘advanced driver display’ (ADD), developed by Jaguar, and one ‘head-up display’ (HUD), designed by BMW. Literature studies and interviews with people experienced in developing the driver area, have formed a base on which the evaluations are built. A HUD solution is recommended for presenting <b>information</b> which seeks <b>the</b> driver’s attention and is related to the driving task, example of this is warnings and navigation help. This kind of information should be salient and placed in a high location, between 4 ° and 8 ° down from a horizontal line of sight in the driver’s field of view (vertically), to be quick to read and to enable the driver to use the peripheral vision to detect danger and traffic. It is important to keep <b>the</b> amount of <b>information</b> as low as possible. A focal distance greater than 2. 5 m makes it easy for the driver to refocus. Green is recommended as the main colour and red is recommended for acute warnings. The height of alphanumerics is recommended to cover the driver’s field of view at least 0. 40 ° vertically.
