5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The missile {{strikes on}} al-Qaeda's Afghan {{training}} camps, aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden, damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties; however, bin Laden {{was not present}} at the time. Following the attacks, the ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on a promise to Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over bin Laden, and the regime instead strengthened its ties with <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> chief.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether bin Laden and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
5000|$|On August 18, he {{received}} the support of Hamza bin Laden, son of Osama bin Laden in a video message produced by <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> network [...] "Al-Sahab media".|$|R

5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, including children, how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri {{became a}} state within the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, with bin Laden {{controlling}} Kabul {{and the eastern}} city of Jalalabad.|$|E
25|$|Radwan Nammous (1950 – April 3, 2016), {{also known}} by his nom de guerre Abu Firas al-Suri, {{was a senior}} {{official}} in <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> affiliated al-Nusra Front, serving as the group's spokesman.|$|E
50|$|The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, or al-Qaeda in Lebanon, (كتائب عبد الله عزام) is a Sunni Islamist militant group, and <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda's</b> {{branch in}} Lebanon. The group, which began {{operating}} in 2009, {{was founded by}} Saudi Saleh Al-Qaraawi and has local networks in various countries, mainly in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Gaza Strip and Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|His former {{clients are}} said to have {{included}} Ayman al-Zawahiri, since 2011 <b>the</b> leader of <b>al-Qaeda,</b> <b>the</b> terrorist organization based in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He also defended al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya.|$|R
50|$|A unit of <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda’s</b> North African branch: <b>al-Qaeda</b> in <b>the</b> Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) {{abducted}} {{the three}} from {{a restaurant in}} Timbuktu, Mali. Because McGowan has dual citizenship, South African & British, the group offered a trade to the British Government for Abu Qatada who was to be deported to Jordan, {{where he had been}} convicted of involvement in militant plots.|$|R
25|$|US {{officials}} and some US media sources called al-Awlaki an Islamic fundamentalist and {{accused him of}} encouraging terrorism. According to documents recovered from bin Laden's hideout, <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> leader was unsure about al-Awlaki's qualifications.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Pakistan Army {{launched}} a campaign in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan's Waziristan region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> and Taliban forces in the area.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly {{written by}} Osama bin Laden urged Somalis {{to build an}} Islamic {{state in the country}} and warned western governments that <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> network would fight against them if they intervened there.|$|E
50|$|After the {{dissolution}} of <b>the</b> ICU, <b>Al-Qaeda</b> reportedly established strong ties with the Al-Shabaab splinter group.|$|R
50|$|The plans {{appeared}} to have been shelved after <b>the</b> successful <b>al-Qaeda</b> attacks on those cities on 11 September.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> modern <b>al-Qaeda</b> {{organization}} is <b>the</b> combination of bin Laden's financial resources with al-Zawahiri's ideological and operational leadership.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{cultural}} differences, assuming <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> Training Manual is authentic, eastern cell structures {{may differ from}} the Western mode. Al-Qaida's minimal core group, only accounting for the leadership, can also be viewed topologically as a ring or chain network, with each leader/node heading their own particular hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground forces}} who {{eventually}} entered Afghanistan {{were left to}} pursue high value targets, including Osama bin Laden, among <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> near the Pakastani border. The high level command of Task Force Dagger remained in the country until the unit was finally redeployed to the United States in April 2002.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Ressam, <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> Millennium Bomber, used a small {{quantity}} of RDX {{as one of}} the components in the explosives that he prepared to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on New Year's Eve 1999/2000; the combined explosives could have produced a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating car bomb.|$|E
25|$|The name 'al-Qaeda' was {{established}} {{a long time}} ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism. We used to call <b>the</b> training camp <b>al-Qaeda.</b> <b>The</b> name stayed.|$|R
50|$|Asim Umar is an Indian man and <b>the</b> {{leader of}} <b>al-Qaeda</b> in <b>the</b> Indian Subcontinent. <b>al-Qaeda</b> leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri {{announced}} {{the creation of}} AQIS and introduced Asim Umar as its leader in a video posted online in September 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The Council urged {{all states}} to {{implement}} Resolution 1373 and reaffirmed {{the need to}} combat terrorism. It {{stressed the importance of}} individuals and entities being listed subject to <b>the</b> nature of <b>Al-Qaeda.</b> <b>The</b> International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was preventing travel documents from being made available to terrorists, and the Council encouraged states to work with Interpol. Furthermore, there was concern at the use of man-portable air-defense systems by <b>Al-Qaeda,</b> <b>the</b> Taliban, Osama bin Laden and associate groups.|$|R
25|$|Tanweer's {{statement}} was therefore clearer {{in making this}} link with British foreign policy than that of Mohammad Sidique Khan, the presumed lead bomber. The video has also served to solidify speculation that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in <b>the</b> <b>Al-Qaeda</b> organisation while in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|On 26 July 2012, FSA fighters stormed an outpost near {{a border}} {{crossing}} with Turkey in northern Syria manned by 40 foreign al-Qaeda fighters which held John Cantlie {{and several other}} journalists prisoners. The journalists escaped to the border crossing during the infighting and <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> fighters fired at them.|$|E
25|$|The unit's {{creation}} {{stems from}} {{the need to provide}} infantry support to the United Kingdom Special Forces, which became evident after the Battle of Tora Bora during which two Special Boat Service (SBS) squadrons assaulted <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> cave complex. Previously, this support was carried out on an ad hoc basis, with infantry units assisting special forces teams when needed.|$|E
50|$|One and a half-month before <b>the</b> attack, <b>Al-Qaeda's</b> then-deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, urged Muslims {{to strike}} against Danish targets in an {{interview}} published by As-Sahab.|$|R
5000|$|Rossmiller {{appeared}} in the 2005 BBC documentary entitled <b>The</b> New <b>al-Qaeda.</b> She, along with other internet cyber sleuths, {{has been criticized for}} her work.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 2008 <b>al-Qaeda</b> {{offensive}} in Iraq was a month-long offensive conducted by al-Qaeda in Iraq against the multinational coalition of USA, UK, Australia and Poland.|$|R
25|$|Again, {{under the}} cover of intense aerial bombardment, US {{infantry}} and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.|$|E
25|$|For each mission {{are created}} {{one or more}} {{operational}} cells. If <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> signature of multiple concurrent attacks is used, {{there may be an}} operational cell for each target location. It will depend on the operation if they will need any support cells in the operational area. For example, it may be more secure to have a local cell build bombs, which will be delivered by cells coming from outside the area.|$|E
25|$|According to the indictment, Adel is {{a member}} of the majlis al shura of al-Qaeda and a member of its {{military}} committee. He has provided military and intelligence training to members of al-Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan, and to anti-UN Somali tribes. It is possible that his trainees included the Somalis of the first Battle of Mogadishu. He established <b>the</b> <b>al-Qaeda</b> training facility at Ras Kamboni in Somalia near the Kenyan border.|$|E
50|$|The Islamic Jihad Union claimed {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> attacks. <b>Al-Qaeda</b> and <b>the</b> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are also suspected {{of being involved in}} the attacks.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Bosnian War and, especially, {{the links}} between <b>the</b> mujahideen, <b>al-Qaeda</b> and <b>the</b> radicalization of some European Muslims was more widely discussed.|$|R
50|$|AQIM {{is thought}} to be <b>the</b> wealthiest <b>al-Qaeda</b> branch, after having gained ransoms of tens of {{millions}} of dollars for the release of kidnapped western hostages.|$|R
