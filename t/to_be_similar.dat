5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to its previous eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> in {{composition}} to Jupiter, {{but the other}} giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that N.rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat (Rattus baluensis). Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during daylight hours, the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may be an example of resource partitioning. Daily scat deposition rates were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> for both mammalian species.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{advances}} in astronomy came {{about with the}} introduction of new technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E

5|$|Some higher {{forms of}} land life are now colonising {{the soil of}} Surtsey. The first {{earthworm}} {{was found in a}} soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year earthworms were not found. Slugs were found in 1998, and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.|$|E

5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> {{to the metal}} stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, {{it is thought that}} her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E

5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} {{continued to}} be described into the early 20th century, with notable paleontologists such as Barnum Brown and Charles Camp collecting specimens. However, aetosaur remains were still being confused with those of phytosaurs. During this time, aetosaurs were usually considered {{to be members of}} Pseudosuchia, a now obsolete group consisting of various Triassic archosaurs including phytosaurs. However, similarities were often observed between aetosaurs and Crocodilia, the group to which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 19th century. While the skull had many features in common with pseudosuchians, parts of the postcranial skeleton, in particular the scutes, seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those of crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} the companion of Sirius to be about half a century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to that of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Clans' territories lies a {{mountain}} range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water. The Tribe is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the Clans, yet follows {{a different set}} of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt.The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E

5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That is much lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily Neritinae. The {{osmotic pressure}} and the composiotion of ionts of the hemolymph of the subfamily Neritininae (where does the Theodoxus belong <b>to)</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the hemolymph of the land snail family Helicinidae.|$|R
5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought they belonged to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As the cane toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E

5|$|In Basse Casamance, {{the rice}} cycle {{structures}} {{the lives of}} the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from African rice to Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> in their level of detail.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in Britain is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh.
