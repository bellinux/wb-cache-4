40|$|The {{impermeability}} of the {{stratum corneum}} often hinders {{the transport of}} molecules across the skin. <b>Temperature</b> <b>modulations</b> in the skin {{and the application of}} local heat both have the potential of circumventing this problem temporarily and reversibly and when applied, may aid in enhancing drug diffusion through the skin. A controlled and precise application of heat has the ability to create a cascade of events in the skin and thus aids in facilitating a faster movement of molecules into and across the skin. Possible mechanisms of enhancing drug permeation include: a) increase in drug diffusivity in the vehicle and/or in the skin, b) increase in partitioning and diffusion, c) disturbance in the lipid structure of the stratum corneum, and d) increased local blood flow. These mechanisms may operate individually or concurrently. The creation of micropores or channels in response to exposure to very high heat energy for a fraction of time is another technique that can facilitate the transport, known as thermal ablation. These micropores then serve as channels from where drug molecules can escape from formulations into the skin at a much faster rate than through passive diffusion. This review, therefore, summarises the effects that <b>temperature</b> <b>modulations</b> may have on the permeability of the skin. Physical techniques of heat induced skin ablation, such as chemical heating, thermoporation, radiofrequency induced thermal ablation, and laser induced thermal ablation are also presented in this review.

40|$|Sensing {{mechanisms}} of gas sensors depend on temperature, {{and this is}} in particular true for metal-oxide semiconductors where the peculiar role of temperature suggested the modulation of temperature as a viable method to tune selectivity and sensitivity. This principle was widely investigated in the past, and methods to design ad hoc temperature behaviors have been proposed. In this paper, instead of a priori temperature profiles, a self-adaptive <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> is proposed. For the scope, a closed-loop circuit connecting the sensor resistance to the sensor heater is designed. In this condition changes in sensor resistance are reflected into changes of operating temperature. Herewith, the method is implemented with an oscillatory circuit, so with a steady resistance value the signal driving the <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> converges to a periodic pattern of pulses that is specific for the sensor state. Since the relationship between resistance and temperature may depend on {{the quality and quantity}} of the gas at which the sensor is exposed, the <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> signal is likely dependent on the kind of gas and its concentration. As a consequence, features describing the <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> signal pattern can be used as a multicomponent variable that can allow for gas identification and quantification. The hypothesis is confirmed by simulations with electronics CAD software and experiments with a commercial metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensor.

Abstract. - The transition thresholds between hexagons and rolls in convective patterns are {{obtained in the}} framework of the amplitude equations. We show that the discrepancies between the theoretical thresholds, calculated for unbounded systems, and the experimental ones, made in finite containers, can be partially corrected by a phenomenological argument. The finite-size effects are responsible for the decreasing in the efficiency of the heat transport across the cell. Using this fact we are able to approach the calculated thresholds to those observed in real experiments. The transition between different symmetries in convective patterns is the subject of some current studies[ll. The transition between hexagons and rolls appears: a) in fluids with temperature-dependent transport coefficients (non-Boussinesq conditions) [2 - 81, b) when the mean temperature in the cell varies (increases or decreases) linearly in time 191, c) in fluids with a temperature-dependent surface tension (BBnard-Marangoni convec-tion) [lo, 111 and d) by <b>temperature</b> <b>modulations</b> in the convective cell [12 - 141...|$|R

40|$|We explore heat {{transfer}} in molecular junctions between two leads {{in the absence}} of a finite net thermal bias. The application of an unbiased time-periodic <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> of the leads entails a dynamical breaking of reflection symmetry, such that a directed heat current may emerge (ratchet effect). In particular, we consider two cases of adiabatically slow driving, namely, (i) periodic <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> of only one lead and (ii) <b>temperature</b> <b>modulation</b> of both leads with an ac driving that contains a second harmonic, thus, generating harmonic mixing. Both scenarios yield sizable directed heat currents, which should be detectable with present techniques.

The ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current. An applied electric stop voltage, yielding effective zero electric current flow, then mimics a solely heat-ratchet-induced thermopower (“ratchet Seebeck effect”), although no net thermal bias is acting.
