2500|$|The <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> on {{the ribbon}} {{cartridge}} and the correction tape spools were color-coded {{so they could}} be easily identified and matched with the appropriate correction tapes: Yellow for the correctable film ribbon and Lift-Off tape; gray, pink, and blue for cloth, carbon film, and Tech-3, respectively. Later another type of correctable film ribbon and lift-off tape appeared, both color-coded orange. The yellow meant the ribbon was a higher quality and would produce a better quality type image. [...] Orange was a lower cost ribbon for everyday typing. The yellow and orange coded lift-off tapes would work with either ribbon type.|$|E
5000|$|The Zorki 4 came in 2 {{variants}} {{the original}} {{which uses a}} <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> to advance to film and cock the shutter. The Zorki 4k included a wind lever for easier operation.|$|E
5000|$|For {{graphics}} input, {{the terminal}} used {{a pair of}} <b>thumb</b> <b>wheels</b> on the keyboard to control {{the position of a}} cursor. The cursor was displayed using a lower intensity of the electron beam that had insufficient energy to cause the storage system to trigger. The cursor was dynamically refreshed by the electronics of the terminal. The cursor was turned on with [...] (...) (which also turned off graphic mode if it was on), and then [...] (...) [...] The position was sent back to the computer using the same X,Y encoding as the graphics commands. This could be done interactively by sending the [...] and then pressing a key on the keyboard, or immediately by the host sending [...]|$|R

5000|$|A jointly {{developed}} mouse by Japanese (NTT) and Swiss (ETH) {{companies may}} mark the first {{appearance of a}} wheel-function on a mouse back in 1985. They developed what was a <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> for their companies, the (original) [...] "Mighty Mouse." [...] This mouse did not catch any traction in the world computing market.|$|E
50|$|The phone has {{physical}} buttons for cellphone use, {{arranged on}} a flip which covers the Palm buttons, Graffiti area, {{and part of}} the screen. The upper part of the screen shows the phone system display when the flip is closed; when the flip is open the screen switches to Palm operation. With the flip closed, phone operations are performed via the flip buttons and a side <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Nikon F70 (or N70 as it {{is known}} in the U.S.) was a SLR camera {{manufactured}} by the Japanese Company Nikon. Introduced in 1994, it is the predecessor to the Nikon F80. This camera is known for its unusual user interface which uses a combination of function and set buttons along with the <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> to navigate the nestled settings. It is quite different compared to other Nikon SLR's of the same era.|$|E
5000|$|Customized App: A step up {{from this}} {{approach}} is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format. In other words, provide information specific to the screen size, optimize usage of screen real estate, and enable device-specific navigation controls. Examples of these include <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> or thumb button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{arrival at}} {{a parking lot}} {{requiring}} parking disc, the parking disc is set and put on display behind the front windshield. The disc has a <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> (or knurling wheel) at the upper side that makes the clock face turn around its center point, allowing it to show different clock times. The standard parking clock can show a full twelve hours, with additional marks for each half-hour. The time to be set is rounded up from the actual arrival time, for example a 10:00:01 arrival would be set to 10:30, while a 10:29:59 arrival would also be set to 10:30. The legal requirements are that [...] "parking is allowed when the vehicle shows a parking disc that is easily readable from the outside and whose clockhand points to {{the mark of the}} half hour that follows the time of arrival".|$|E
5000|$|... 1981's biggest {{news was}} the {{introduction}} of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in3 V8-6-4 engine. Developed by the Eaton Corporation - with design elements that had been tested for over 500000 mi - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The [...] Buick V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering {{in the spring of}} 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply {{get in and out of}} the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The V6 option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 Cadillac Brougham models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or [...] "max" [...] settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|E
40|$|An {{operator}} can {{rapidly and}} automatically produce coded electrical signals by manipulating mechanical <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> switches {{so as to}} instruct a service center to connect any number of telephone lines to the console thus enabling the operator to listen and/or talk over several lines simultaneously. The system includes an on-site console having several mechanically operated <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> switches to which the desired lines to be connected can be dialed in. Electrical coded signals are fed {{to a number of}} banks of line AND gates representing units, tens and hundreds, a group of channel gates, and a command gate. These signals are gated out in a controlled manner to an encoder which generates tones that are transmitted over a single line to a communication service center...|$|E
40|$|An {{inexpensive}} {{controlled drug}} infusion system based around 80 C 85 microprocessor with RAM, EPROM and peripheral interface devices is developed. In this system, the drop rate selection {{is done by}} BCD <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> switches from 1 to 99 drops/min, LCD display is used for displaying the parameters settings, number of drops infused and various alarms messages for patient safety and unique drop sensing assembly is incorporated for accurate detection of falling drops in drip chamber. The prototype has been tested successfully on neonates...|$|E
40|$|A {{microprocessor}} controlled programmable {{pulse generator}} was {{specifically designed to}} interface with the JEOL JNM-FT- 1 A Radio Frequency (RF) section of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The programmable pulse generator was programmed and controlled by an IBM compatible computer. Statis rams were utilized as the programmable pulse generator 2 Ì† 7 s on board memory which were used to store the pulse sequences. Pulse widths can be programmed from 0. 2 microseconds to 14. 3 minutes. The JEOL RF section is unique in that it allows the pulse generator to control the phase of the RF transmitted to the NMR probe and whether the sample will be decoupled. These two items set this programmable pulse generator apart from other pulse generators described in the literature and those systems which are commercially available. This programmable pulse generator was constructed to replace the old JEOL <b>thumb</b> <b>wheel</b> controlled pulse generator. Typical 180 degree pulse lengths for the JEOL NMR are approximately 20 microseconds...|$|E
