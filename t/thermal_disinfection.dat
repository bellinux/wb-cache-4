Solar heat collectors can have lenses in front of them, or use reflectors. They may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing. In addition, some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based, while others (through-flow solar <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection)</b> operate almost continuously while the Sun shines.

40|$|Background: Manufacturers’ {{recommendations}} on cleaning of tracheostomy tubes focus on general warning information and non-specific manual cleaning procedures. The {{aim of this}} experimental study was to evaluate different reprocessing methods and to determine the mechanical integrity and functionality of tracheostomy tubes following reprocessing. Methods: Sixteen cuffed or un-cuffed tracheostomy tubes obtained from hospital in-patients were reprocessed {{using one of the}} following reprocessing methods: a) manual brushing and rinsing with tap water, b) manual brushing followed by disinfection with a glutaraldehyde solution, c) manual brushing followed machine-based cleaning in a dishwasher, and d) manual brushing followed by ultrasound cleaning in a commercially available ultrasound device. Microbial burden of the tubes before and after reprocessing was assessed by measurement of microbial colony-forming units per mL (CFU/mL) of rinsing fluid. After cleaning, tracheostomy tubes were investigated for loss of functionality. Findings: Manual brushing and rinsing with tap water reduced microbial colonization in average by 102 CFU/mL, but with poor reproducibility and reliability. Complete microbial reduction was achieved only with additional chemical or machine-based <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Ultrasound sonification yielded no further microbial reduction after manual brushing. Conclusion: Manual brushing alone will not result in complete eradication of microorganism colonising cuffed or un-cuffed tracheostomy tubes. However, manual cleaning followed by chemical or <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> may be regarded as safe and reproducible reprocessing method. If a machine-based reprocessing method is used for cuffed tubes, the cuffs’ ventilation hose must be secured in a safe position prior to <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection...</b>|$|E

40|$|A novel type {{of solar}} <b>thermal</b> water <b>disinfection</b> unit is {{presented}} in this work. The system is safe {{and easy to use}} and can be built with basic tools and widely available materials. In the unit, water is disinfected by temperature increase up to the boiling point and output is controlled by the change in density. For employing the change in density to control the water output, a dimensioning procedure is suggested, giving the required height of the water reservoir, the heating section and the rising tube. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the temperature increase in the rising tube, as it follows the temperature increase in the heated section. A model is presented to predict the water output and find a cost-effective configuration. For heating the water a simple flat plate absorber was designed and tested. With approximately 2 square meters of absorber area, up to 50 liters water output are expected per day in regions with high solar irradiation. The system was tested with contaminated water from the sewage and a reduction to zero coliform bacteria/ 100 ml was obtained. In order to promote the distribution of the system, a construction manual is in the design process...|$|R

This parameter is commonly defined as the time required for the number of surviving microorganisms to decrease 1 logarithmic unit. The assumption made in establishing a D value is that the rate of kill exhibits first-order kinetics under the specified conditions. Such exponential kill rates are seen with <b>thermal</b> contact lens <b>disinfection</b> system. A comparison of the death rate kinetics for a variety of chemical contact lens disinfecting solutions was undertaken to ascertain the suitability of D-value determination for these chemical disinfectants. The active agents of these different solutions included hydrogen peroxide, thimerosal, chlorhexidine, tris(2 -hydroxyethyl) tallow ammonium chloride, thimerosal, polyaminopropyl biguanide, and polyquaternium- 1. The solutions were challenged with 10 (6) CFU of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Staphylococcus hominis per ml, and survival rate was determined. This study clearly demonstrates the nonlinear nature of the inactivation curves for most contact lens chemical disinfecting solutions for the challenge organisms.

40|$|Nosocomial {{legionellosis}} is {{a growing}} concern worldwide. In Hungary, about 20 % of the reported cases are health-care associated, but in the absence of legal regulation, environmental monitoring of Legionella is not routinely performed in hospitals. In the present study, 23 hospitals were investigated. The hot water distribution system was colonized by Legionella in over 90 %; counts generally exceeded the public health limit value. Hot water temperature was critically low in all systems (< 45 °C), and large differences (3 – 38 °C temperature drop) were observed within buildings, indicating insufficient circulation. Most facilities were older than 30 years (77 %); however, new systems (n = 3) were also shown to be rapidly colonized at low hot water temperature. Vulnerable source of drinking water, complex distribution system, and large volume hot water storage increased the risk of Legionella prevalence (OR = 28. 0, 27. 3, 27. 7, respectively). Risk management interventions (including <b>thermal</b> or chemical <b>disinfection)</b> were only efficient if the system operation was optimized. Though the risk factors were similar, in those hospitals where nosocomial legionellosis was reported, Legionella counts and the proportion of L. pneumophila sg 1 isolates were significantly higher. The results of environmental prevalence of legionellae in hospitals suggest that the incidence of nosocomial legionellosis is likely to be underreported.

40|$|Decentralized {{drinking}} water systems represent {{an important element}} in the process of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as centralized systems are often inefficient or nonexistent in developing countries. In those countries, most water quality related problems are due to hygiene factors and pathogens. A potential solution might include decentralized systems, which might rely on <b>thermal</b> and/or UV <b>disinfection</b> methods as well as physical and chemical treatments to provide {{drinking water}} from rainwater. For application in developing countries, decentralized systems major constraints include low cost, ease of use, environmental sustainability, reduced maintenance and independence from energy sources. This work focuses on an innovative decentralized system {{that can be used to}} collect and treat rainwater for potable use (drinking and cooking purposes) of a single household, or a small community. The experimented treatment system combines in one compact unit a Filtration process with an adsorption step on GAC and a UV disinfection phase in an innovative design (FAD - Filtration Adsorption Disinfection). All tests have been carried out using a full scale FAD treatment unit. The efficiency of FAD technology has been discussed in terms of pH, turbidity, COD, TOC, DOC, Escherichia coli and Total coliforms. FAD technology is attractive since it provides a total barrier for pathogens and organic contaminants, and reduces turbidity, thus increasing the overall quality of the water. The FAD unit costs are low, especially if compared to other water treatment technologies and could become a viable option for developing countries...|$|R
40|$|The work {{refers to}} an {{innovative}} system inspired by nature that mimics the thermoregulation system that exists in animals. This method, which is called Anti Bacteria Heat Exchanger (ABHE), is proposed to achieve continuous <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> of bacteria in hot water systems with high energy efficiency. In particular, this study aims to demonstrate the opportunity to gain energy by means of recovering heat over a plate heat exchanger. Firstly, the thermodynamics of the ABHE is clarified to define the ABHE specification. Secondly, a first prototype of an ABHE is built with a specific configuration based on simplicity regarding design and construction. Thirdly, an experimental test is carried out. Finally, a computer model is built to simulate the ABHE system and the experimental data is used to validate the model. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} performance of the ABHE system is strongly dependent on the flow rate, while the supplied temperature has less effect. Experimental and simulation data show a large potential for saving energy of this <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> method by recovering heat. To exemplify, when supplying water at a flow rate of 5  kg/min and at a temperature of 50  °C, the heat recovery is about 1. 5  kW while the required pumping power is 1  W.

Nevertheless, only a few clear guidelines regarding cleaning and disinfection of nebulizers are available. This survey aims to analyze the common household methods used by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Belgium. METHODS: A questionnaire about type of nebulizer, methods, and frequency of cleaning, disinfection, and drying was established by physiotherapists at the Belgian CF centers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Belgian CF Association sent this questionnaire to all Belgian CF patients. Of the 903 questionnaires distributed, 379 (42 %) were returned. Fifty-two, 40 and 8 % of patients used a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, jet nebulizer, or ultrasonic device, respectively. Ninety-eight percent of patients cleaned their material and soap was used by 35 % of patients. Disinfection was performed by 91 % of the patients and was daily performed by 57 % of patients. <b>Thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> (boiling water or sterilizer), a hypochlorite-based solution, or acetic acid solution was used by 44, 29, and 25 % of patients, respectively, to disinfect their nebulizers. <b>Thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> was used by 37 and 53 % of patients using a classical or vibrating-mesh nebulizer, respectively. After cleaning or disinfection, 91 % of the material was dried. The high percentage of Belgian CF patients disinfecting their nebulizer proves that they seem aware of the hygiene problem. The lack of unanimous guidelines in Belgium {{at the time of}} the study perhaps explains the variety of methods used.

40|$|Background: The {{penultimate}} {{stage in}} endoscope reprocessing {{is the final}} rinse with water following terminal disinfection. This requires a degree of microbiological and chemical control {{of the quality of}} the final rinse water. Aim: To report experience gained over five years of testing, reporting and managing the quality of final rinse water for endoscopic devices. Methods: Three endoscope reprocessing units, each comprising five endoscope washer-disinfectors (EWDs) supplied by two reverse osmosis (RO) water units, were subjected to weekly monitoring and control of final rinse water quality. EWDs were subjected to nightly thermal self-disinfection, and RO units were subjected to periodic sanitization with peracetic acid. Final rinse water samples were processed periodically for total viable counts (TVCs), Pseudomonas spp., endotoxins, conductivity, environmental mycobacteria and Legionella spp. Findings: Over the five-year study period (2008 – 2013), no Pseudomonas spp., environmental mycobacteria or Legionella spp. were isolated from endoscopy rinse water. All conductivity readings were below 30 μs/cm. Endotoxin levels fluctuated over the recommended cut-off of 0. 25 EU/mL, with no correlation with TVCs. Trend analysis of TVCs established alert and action limits. Apart from the supply water of one EWD becoming contaminated with Aspergillus spp., there have been no interruptions to operational capacity of the endoscope reprocessing units. Conclusions: Quality control principles coupled with appropriate <b>thermal</b> and chemical <b>disinfection</b> of EWDs resulted in the achievement of microbiological standards for final rinse water. A co-ordinated team approach between the microbiology department, infection control department, endoscope unit managers and estates department is required to achieve this degree of success...|$|R
40|$|A 4 -factor, multilevel, full {{factorial}} design of 240 experiments {{was performed in}} order to investigate the effect of temperature on the inactivation efficiency of spiked Escherichia coli in simulated solar disinfection of a synthetic secondary effluent. The initial population of the microorganisms was 103, 104, 105 and 106 CFU/mL, the exposure time 1, 2, 3 and 4 h, the treatment temperature 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 degrees C and the sunlight intensity 0, 800 and 1200 W/m(2). Radical changes in bacterial behavior, process efficiency and remaining populations were observed, while treating effluents in discreet temperatures. Elevating treatment temperature from 20 to 40 degrees C drastically impaired <b>disinfection.</b> <b>Thermal</b> inactivation with no regrowth predominated at 50 degrees C and total inactivation of microorganisms was observed at 60 degrees C in nonirradiated samples. Irradiation at 800 and 1200 W/m 2 much increased inactivation efficiency, especially at 50 and 60 degrees C, proving sensitive light-temperature synergy at those temperatures. Total inactivation was achieved within 4 h under a range of treatment conditions, including all samples at 1200 W/m(2), or 60 degrees C samples at 800 W/m(2). Also, 99. 9 - 100 % efficiencies and final population below 1000 CFU/ 100 mL were obtained at 800 W/m(2) and temperatures of 50 degrees C and above.

40|$|Medical waste, {{according}} to the law of waste management is waste generated in medical and health institutions (dispensaries, hospitals, polyclinics and outpatient clinics, dental clinics, veterinary stations etc.), originated as a product of used items and materials during diagnosis, convalescence, treatment and prevention in humans and animals. Medical waste is a risk to those who produce, package, store, transport, treat and perform disposition. The possibility of infection of some diseases and their spread in hospitals due to negligence in the handling of medical waste, have to inform the entire staff in management and disposition to reduce the risk to minimum. The actual management of medical waste, is an organized process that consists of five elements: separation, identification, handling, treatment and disposal. Medical waste, as a waste that {{is a result of the}} provision of informal care can be divided into two groups - municipal and hazardous medical waste. The municipal medical waste includes: paper, cartons, glass, food scraps and other common debris arising in the administration, kitchens and laundries. On the other hand hazardous medical waste contains elements of chemical and biological threat, whether in the form of solid, liquid or gaseous waste. The properties of hazardous medical waste are virulence, toxicity, carcinogenicity, infection and so on. According to these properties hazardous medical waste differs from the municipal medical waste. Objective: The aim of the study was to highlight the importance of knowledge of legal regulations and provisions of the proper management of medical waste with special emphasis on attitudes, division and recommendations of the World Health Organization. Material and Methods: As a special heterogeneous mixture of municipal, infectious, pathological, pharmaceutical, laboratory waste, disinfection agents and packaging, as well as radioactive and chemical waste, hazardous medical waste can be divided into several subgroups for easier and more accurate identification and, therefore, is divided on: - Infectious (laboratory cultures, fluids, materials and equipment that have been in contact with infected patients); - Pathological (blood, other body fluids, body parts, fetuses); - Sharp (objects of needles, scalpels, knives, broken glass); - Pharmaceutical (drugs, residues of drugs); - Genotoxic (cytostatic, genotoxic chemicals); - Chemical (solvents, laboratory reagents, disinfectants); - Heavy metal (batteries, sphygmomanometers, thermometers); - Pressure vessels (gas cylinders, metal vessels) and - Radioactive waste (scrap used in radiation therapy, urine and fluids of patients treated with radio-nuclides). Infectious medical waste should be disinfected before disposition in a properly permitted land fill. Disinfected means the waste has been treated by any method used to destroy or kill infectious microorganisms with a potential to cause disease Effective treatments include: • Incineration in a facility approved and permitted in compliance with the current requirements of the Idaho air quality rules. • Sterilization by heating in a steam sterilizer, such as an autoclave, at time lengths and temperatures necessary to kill infectious agents within the waste. • Other methods include chemical <b>disinfection,</b> <b>thermal</b> inactivation, irradiation, and gas/vapor sterilization. Results: The World Health Organization recommends as protective gear for anyone who comes into contact with medical waste to wear: helmet; protective face mask; goggles; Special jumpsuits; industrial aprons; feet guards; boots etc. it is recommended that generators of infectious medical waste require companies or persons collecting and disposing of the waste to supply the generator with certified forms documenting proper management and disposal of the waste. Regulation and management by country is different, for example in the UK clinical waste and the way it is to be handled is closely regulated. In the US biomedical waste is usually regulated as medical waste. Conclusion: It's important to clearly define the responsibility for proper waste management, to the process of its final processing. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive and planned management system that beside responsibility, should provide funds for safe implementation of waste. This is a long process that despite organizational structure requires individual and professional commitment. The rules and regulations worldwide (1988 - UK; 1998 - US) work with The Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling). Worldwide, there are specific colored bags, bins and labels that are recommended for each type of waste (syringes, needles and blood-soiled bandages should be all disposed of in a yellow or red colored bag or bin, where it will later be incinerated).

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent Legionella contamination, several methods have been {{developed}} with which the bacteria can be killed in (tap) water. The most common method is <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection,</b> with which the bacteria are killed through heating. Other methods use different techniques to kill Legionella, {{such as the use}} of UV-light, copper-silver ionisation or oxidizing substances. In this literature study, the specific biological mechanisms behind several methods of Legionella control were studied. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in effectiveness. Of course, all methods also have advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, utility, safety and so on, but these are only marginally referred to in this research. UV-light only has an effect on the DNA of the micro-organism: the DNA is damaged and becomes dysfunctional, due to which the Legionella bacteria die. When using UV-light, it is of importance that the dosage and duration of the radiation is sufficient. With a short exposure, a high intensity is needed to provide enough energy. The dosage emitted by the UV-lamp can moreover damage only a limited amount of DNA. If the Legionella are located in protozoa that have a large amount of DNA (in the nucleus as well as the mitochondria), possibly less damage is done to the DNA of the Legionella bacteria. Copper-silver ionisation is a cheap method and an effective way of killing Legionella. However, as with UV-light, the Legionella bacteria can be protected by the protozoa and/or a biofilm. Another disadvantage is that the use of heavy metals in waterworks brings with it risks for public health. Besides above mentioned methods, there are oxidizing substances that can kill off Legionella. Of these, chlorine is especially suitable in preventing the spread of Legionella, as a supplement to other methods. Disinfection with ozone is more effective, but has the disadvantage that ozone is quickly deactivated in water. Peroxides are also used extensively in waterworks disinfection. Similar to UV-light and copper-silver ionisation, the oxidizing substances must penetrate the protozoa that harbour the Legionella for a proper disinfection. Whether these methods of disinfection have a sufficiently lethal effect on Legionella is not yet known. With <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection,</b> Legionella bacteria that have infected the protozoa are also reached, as well as the Legionella bacteria located in a biofilm. The temperature increases without as well as within the protozoa, and leads to damage to the Legionella bacteria present. A second point that supports <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> methods is that, through heating, multiple parts of the cell are destroyed. The chance that Legionella survives this combination of factors is in this way reduced to a minimum...|$|E

This experimental research {{was carried out in}} pilot-scale on the effluent of the extended aeration activated sludge wastewater treatment system in Kashan. The plant is located at the Kashan University of Medical Sciences campus and receives about 100 m 3 /d sewage from official and residential building blocks. In this study <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> of the effluent in 55 ºC for 2 hours using flat plat solar collector (FPSC) was investigated. During the study in the beginning of every week, one day was selected randomly and the pilot was run. The pilot influent temperature was the same as ambient air throughout the day. If the liquid temperature within the pilot increased above 55 ºC, a thermostatic valve opened. Passed liquid was maintained for 2 hours in this temperature. Whenever the volume of disinfected effluent was measurable fecal MPN test and Nemathoda eggs count-up were done according to the Standard Methods and Leeds-II directions, respectively. In 200 days from April to November the geometric mean of fecal coliform never exceeded the WHO guideline (1000 MPN/ 100 mL), but in 5 days (21 %) it exceeded the Iranian standard (400 / 100 mL). Mathematical mean of Nemathoda eggs was less than 1 per liter (Engelberg Index) persistently. The mean of hydraulic loading rates was calculated 83. 25 L/d m 2 while it decreased to 41. 85 L/d. m 2 in the days without thermal reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{treatments}} are commonly adopted for poultry house sanitation. In fact, ordinary floor disinfection {{is needed to}} deplete the pathogenic population (i. e. various species of bacteria and fungi) and {{reduce the risk of}} meat contamination. The increasing focus on the health of consumers and operators, as well as on food quality, has led farmers to consider alternative environmentally friendly methods. Research was carried out to set up a new machine for floor disinfection of poultry houses by open flame. The trials were run in controlled conditions in the laboratory of the University of Pisa, Italy, and on a private farm. The first experiment consisted of a series of test bench trials carried out to evaluate the efficacy and the adjustment of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fed open flame burners on pre-inoculated steel plates. In the second experiment, the operative parameters of a custom-built 1. 5 m wide mounted flaming machine were determined and the biological effects of the treatment were compared to ordinary chemical treatments. The results obtained were very promising. Test bench trials showed a 4 -log reduction in E. coli, and microbial determinations carried out on-farm did not show any difference between thermal and chemical treatment. In addition, the cost estimation showed that <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> is approximately 4 -fold cheaper than chemical sanitation methods. The effective working capacity of the machine was approximately 1700 m 2 h – 1, and the LPG consumption was approximately 16 kg per 1000 m 2. Flame disinfection of poultry grow-out facilities could represent a valid alternative to chemical disinfection...|$|E

In fact, ordinary floor disinfection {{is needed to}} achieve the depletion of pathogenic population (i. e. some species of bacteria and fungi) and {{reduce the risk of}} meat contamination. Recently, the increased attention of consumers and operators health, as well as the quality of food, brought farmers to consider environmental friendly alternative methods. A specific two-year experimental research (2005 - 2007) was carried out in a Central-Northern part of Italy in order to set up new machines and strategies for floor disinfection of poultry houses by means of an open flame. The trials were run in the machine shop of the University of Pisa (indoor, under controlled conditions) and in two different private farms (a broiler house and an outdoor pheasant farm). The first experiment consisted in a series of bench test trials, carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency and the adjustment of LPG fed open flame burners on pre-inoculated steel plates. During the second experiment, the ordinary chemical disinfection strategy was compared, in a broiler house, to the innovative technique, carried out by means of an adapted 1. 5 m wide mounted flaming machine. The last experiment consisted in the evaluation of the efficiency and operative performances of a 2 m wide flaming machine prototype built for open air pheasant farms. The results obtained are very promising as, <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> strategy seems to be very effective on floor pathogens and cheaper than the ordinary chemical one...|$|E
40|$|Legionella {{are known}} as one of the {{dangerous}} water-borne pathogens, causing severe respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to assess the installation water quality in an educational building located in Lublin on the basis of Legionella sp. concentration and physicochemical parameters of cold and hot installation water. Samples (n= 60) of cold and hot water were collected for testing from the 10 tapping points during three surveys over a period of five months. The test samples were analyzed for the basic physicochemical parameters of the water quality such as pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, hardness, alkalinity, the total carbon content, the concentration of nitrates, chlorides and sulphates. Additionally, the concentration of calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and zinc were examined. The presence of Legionella in water samples was measured according the standard methods. The quality of the analyzed water did not raise objections and met the criteria of the Ordinance of the Polish Ministry of Health (2015, pos. 1989). The only parameter which did not comply with applicable regulations was the temperature of the supply water and return hot water - it was lower than required. Bacteria of the genus Legionella were detected only in the hot water samples from series 1 when the rate of colonization reached the level of 80 %. Among the positive samples, 2 contained less than 1000 CFU/ 100 ml, 4 samples contained 1 x 103 to 1 x 104 CFU/ 100 ml, and 2 samples contained more than 1 x 104 CFU/ 100 ml. The maximum number of CFU in a sample was 1. 8 x 104 / 100 ml. The most dangerous serogroup L. pneumophila sg 1 was not detected in any of the positive isolated samples. All Legionella - positive samples belonged to L. pneumophila sg 2 - 14. These findings necessitated a corrective action in the form of <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> system and its maintenance. Its effectiveness was confirmed by the results of the survey of 2 and 3...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} and decades {{increasingly}} more emphasis {{has been placed on}} alcohol-based solutions for hygienic and surgical hand disinfection. Traditional handwashing with soap and water has been largely replaced in the everyday clinical setting, as has the use of disinfectant soap-based solutions for surgical hand disinfection. It has been possible in recent years to reduce the exposure time for alcohol-based hand disinfection in surgery from 5 to 3 minutes, and there are plans to reduce this even further. The growing awareness of the tolerability issues has also given rise to favorable developments here. There have also been dramatic changes in preoperative skin disinfection. The non-alcoholic solutions with a slow onset of action (e. g. iodophors) have been virtually replaced by alcohol-based solutions of demonstrated efficacy. Non-alcoholic solutions continue to be used for disinfection of mucous membranes, but iodine-based products are being phased out here. The term “instrument disinfection” has been largely supplanted now by the expression “instrument reprocessing or medical device decontamination” (which is also underpinned by legislation) and it takes account of the trend towards <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection.</b> Meticulous cleaning is thus an indispensable precondition for sterilization, which normally follows disinfection. The greatest lack of consensus at European level relates to surface disinfection. Routine, parallel cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces close to and remote from the patient is being increasingly replaced by selective disinfection, whenever warranted, of surfaces close to the patient. The problem here is that medical personnel continue to view cleaning and disinfection as interchangeable tasks. This situation is further {{compounded by the fact that}} hospitals are finding it increasingly more difficult to assure adequately successful cleaning and disinfection outcomes. To ensure effective infection control, cleaning and disinfection of surfaces in special situations must also be assured whenever warranted outside the regular working hours. Disinfection and decontamination of highly complex medical devices that pose special challenges (heat-sensitive devices with an intricate design and, correspondingly, with surfaces that are difficult to access, e. g. flexible endoscopes) will present the main challenge in the future. There is still much to be accomplished here to assure the hygienic safety of the patient...|$|E
40|$|In {{allogeneic}} bone transplantation, {{the transmission}} of viral and non-viral infectious pathogens is the most severe undesirable concomitant phenomenon. The investigations published were examined regarding the inactivating capacity of inactivation procedures that are presently performed in bone banks (peracetic acid/ethanol, gamma irradiation, moist heat) against clinically relevant pathogens (aiming at a virus titer reduction of at least 4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml or titer reduction of non-viral micro-organisms of at least 5 log 10 cfu/ml). In the suspension experiments, treatment with peracetic acid/ethanol (peracetic acid 2 %, ethanol 96 %, aqua ad iniectabilia 2 : 1 : 1, 4 hours, 200 mbar, agitation) achieved a titer reduction of > 4 log 10 already after 5 minutes {{for a number of}} viruses (PSR, PV, BVDV). HIV- 2 was also inactivated within 5 minutes below the level of detection (4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml was only reached after 4 hours. The results mentioned could be confirmed in the carrier test (contaminated spongiosa cuboids used as ‘worst case’ scenario). In the suspension experiment {{as well as in the}} carrier test, the HAV titer was reduced after 4 hours by only 3. 7 log 10 and 2. 87 log 10, respectively. The preceding step of defatting the spongiosa tissue by chloroform/ethanol was validated using cell-associated HAV and showed an HAV titer reduction of 7 log 10. In the investigations regarding non-viral pathogens, all test organisms were completely inactivated by more than 5 log 10 steps (cfu/ml). Gamma irradiation was the second procedure examined. D 10 values (irradiation dose required to reduce 90 % of the pathogen titers by one log 10 step) that were determined in inactivation kinetics experiments (irradiation conditions: – 30 °C, 60 Co source) corresponded to data published so far. In order to provide for maximal safety, an irradiation dose of 34 kGy was recommended for allogeneic bone transplants using BPV and a diaphysis model from human femurs. The ‘Marburg bone bank system’ was the third procedure examined (<b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection,</b> guaranteed temperature of at least 82. 5 °C for a minimum of 15 min) using centrally contaminated human femoral heads. All viruses were completely inactivated and their titer reduced by more than 4 log 10 steps. Vegetative bacteria and fungi were also completely inactivated (>= 6 log 10 in the supernatant). As expected, spores and spore-forming pathogens were not sufficiently inactivated and not inactivated, respectively (titer reduction of less than 2 log 10 cfu/ml). However, the latter group can be disregarded, since femoral heads are procured in the operation room under sterile conditions and the following production process rules out a secondary contamination with spores. It could be shown in the investigations presented that all three procedures examined guarantee an inactivation of the viruses investigated according to the recommendations by the senior federal authorities. The three treatment procedures offer additional biosafety by a comprehensive inactivation of non-viral pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Hand hygiene {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} measures to prevent transmission of infectious agents and plays a major role in prevention of infection in any type of healthcare setting. While requirements for the efficacy of hand disinfectants are defined in European testing norms such as the EN 1500 for hygienic hand disinfection or EN 12791 for surgical hand preparation, no specific recommendations for hand rub dispensers and liquid soap dispensers have been given yet. Therefore, the intention of the present recommendation on soap and hand rub dispensers in healthcare facilities is to close this gap and to enhance future improvement of dispenser functionality and design. Regardless of manufacture and design of a hand rub or liquid soap dispensers the following requirements shall be met in healthcare facilities: Triggering the dispenser must be possible without using hands. Sensor- or elbow-operated dispensers both fulfill this requirement. Dispensers must be only refillable in a modality where the content, be it a hand rub or liquid soap, cannot be contaminated. This is achieved best by using replaceable cartridge systems. Refilling through “top-up” must not be possible. The disperser should allow usage of different types of cartridges made by different manufacturers. Dispensers must be operated and maintained such that a microbial contamination of the pump nozzle may easily be avoided. It must be possible to identify the products used in a dispenser easily and without any manipulation. Identifying the type of product, be it a hand rub or a liquid soap, as well as reading the product's name and critical manufacturers' warnings must be possible at any time. The disperser must allow identification of the level of the used product without any further manipulation at any time. The design of the dispenser must allow easy cleaning and disinfection the outside and inside of the dispenser. The manufacturer of the dispenser must provide the user with information on applicable chemicals and cleaning products. It must be possible to reprocess the dispenser and all of its permanent parts by applying machine based <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> at an A 0 -value of minimum 60 (e. g. 80 °C/ 1 minute). Automatically portioning dispensers shall not fail during 200 hubs. The maximal allowed failure rate shall not exceed 1 % (2 out of 200 consecutive hubs). A dispenser used for alcohol based hand rubs must allow keeping the alcohol concentration constant over a time period of 3 months. The maximum acceptable decrease in the concentration of the alcohol shall not exceed 5 %. Liquid soap and hand rub dispensers with single-use pumps, ideally already mounted on the cartridge and to be discharged with the empty cartridge, are preferable. If pumps are used on the next consecutive cartridge, the manufacturer must provide the user with a detailed introduction for cleansing and reprocessing before further use. Because of forensic reasons it is recommended to place a good readable sign on the dispenser indicating e. g. “Apply alcohol based hand rubs only on the hand! Do not drink, avoid spraying into the eye or application on mucous membranes”. It is regarded as an additional benefit, if the dispenser is able to document the consumption of hand rub or the frequency of hubs either mechanically or electronically...|$|E

L’objectif de ce projet est de construire des systèmes de culture durables en utilisant des techniques alternatives comme les successions de culture diversifiées, la solarisation ou l’utilisation d’amendements organiques, et en optimisant leur combinaison. Comme les connaissances scientifiques sont très partielles dans ce domaine, le projet s’appuie également sur les savoirs des agriculteurs et de conseillers agricoles. Après avoir construit une base de données qui {{permet de}} comparer avec le même formalisme les connaissances scientifiques issues de la littérature et les connaissances expertes nous identifions les complémentarités et les contradictions entre ces connaissances et cherchons à les analyser. Les méthodes d’Intelligence Artificielle comme la théorie de l’évidence ou la théorie de l’argumentation seront testées sur ces données. L’objectif, une fois que ce jeu de connaissance aura été validé, est de construire un modèle des interactions entre techniques culturales, processus biologiques et état du milieu pour simuler l’évolution des attaques de pathogènes. Ce modèle sera utilisé avec des agriculteurs et des conseillers agricoles pour concevoir et évaluer de nouveaux systèmes de culture alternatifs. Protected vegetable crops are facing new stakes as regards the limiting use of chemical products to avoid pesticide residues in the food products and in ground water, while avoiding any visual symptom of pests and diseases to agree with marketing-firm requirements. The aim of this project is to build sustainable cropping systems by using alternative techniques such as diversified crop sequences, <b>thermal</b> <b>disinfection</b> or organic manure and optimizing their combination. This goal cannot be reached using the sole scientific knowledge since systemic knowledge on that subject is very poor. However, {{a wealth of information}} and knowledge is available from local practitioners (farmers and technical advisors), especially on the interactions betweens techniques, environment and the expression of pathogens’ activity on the plants. The first step of the project has been to build a database which enables to use a uniform representation frame for scientific literature and empirical knowledge extracted in on-farm surveys. This enables to analyse the effects of each cropping technique on the evolution of soil-born pathogens, taking into account the pedoclimatic conditions in which the technique has been applied and the whole cropping system at hand. The second step is to use this framework {{to determine the effects of}} a particular technique or combination of techniques on a specific pathogen, and identify the contracdisction between various knowledge. Methods of AI, like evidence theory or argumentation framework shall be tested on these data. The third step will be triggered when no conclusion can be drawn on the effect of one practice on the development of pathogens, because there are too many contradictions between growers and/or with scientific current knowledge. Then, group discussion between growers and advisers will be conducted to get a more experienced insight and to attempt to identify the roots of the contradiction. If necessary, experimental plots will be designed with the growers to conduct a focussed study of the problem. The last step is to build a dynamic model of the interactions between cropping techniques, biological processes and environmental conditions to simulate the evolution of soil born pathogens in given cropping systems. This model will be used, with growers and advisors, in an iterative process of design, evaluation by the model and improvement of new cropping system...|$|E
