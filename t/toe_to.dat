5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} {{point out that}} it is unclear whether the stirrup was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in India had a small loop for a single <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the stirrup and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed in 1893, the WFM shared the AFL's conservatism. But its experiences {{going up against}} Mine Owners' Associations and their allies convinced the WFM that acting in a non-threatening manner wasn't going to accomplish anything worthwhile. Many union members had begun to reconsider their conservative assumptions about confrontation and violence. By the late 1890s, the WFM believed {{that it would have}} to go <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> toe with mine owners and other employers. The WFM even considered creating rifle clubs for carefully chosen members.|$|E
25|$|Dancers {{strive to}} exhibit ballon in large jumps {{as well as}} in small, quick jumps such as petite allegro steps. For example, ballon is a {{characteristic}} of pas de chat. The dancer starts from a plié (bent knees) and then, during the ascending phase of the step, lifts each knee in succession with hips turned out, so that for a moment both feet are in the air and the dancer appears to be suspended in air. To give the appearance of lightness when landing, the dancer pliés and rolls the foot from <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> heel.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, {{and sooner or later}} the load will have to be shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (<b>toe)</b> <b>to</b> as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
25|$|A back march may be {{used when}} the band wishes {{to move in the}} {{opposite}} direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backwards, putting each foot down and rolling from the <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backwards marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backwards, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} raised {{tailings}} dam designs, the upstream, downstream and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream tailings dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E

25|$|Pulver battled back in {{the third}} round, {{successfully}} defending Penn's attempts {{to take him to}} the ground, and even scoring defensive takedowns on Penn. Pulver frustrated Penn with nothing more than sheer will power, not only winning the later rounds, but out-grappling the world-renowned Penn. In the fifth round, Penn, frustrated and down on points, chose to stand and trade with Pulver. For the entire five minutes of the fifth round the two stood <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> toe exchanging strikes. With 45 seconds left in the round, a left hand from Pulver staggered Penn, who looked in trouble. However, Penn countered with a right kick straight to the groin, resulting in a 50-second time-out. Although the time-out gave Penn time to recover, when the bout was restarted, Pulver staggered him a second time with 20 seconds remaining. However, the round drew to a conclusion and the fight went into the judges' hands.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā sits on his lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E

[...] The book describes in detail six different meditations involving {{making full use of}} the lungs' capacity to expand and contract, oxygenating the blood and the cells within, imagining heat travelling upwards from <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> the head, allowing the skin to feel under itself, and experiencing touch with another person's body and examining their figure.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{conservative}} treatment {{consisting of}} physical therapy and new shoes with soft, spacious toe boxes {{is enough to}} resolve the condition, while in more severe or longstanding cases Hammertoe Surgery {{may be necessary to}} correct the deformity. The patient's doctor may also prescribe some toe exercises that can be done at home to stretch and strengthen the muscles. For example, the individual can gently stretch the toes manually, or use the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> pick things up off the floor. While watching television or reading, one can put a towel flat under the feet and use the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> crumple it. The doctor can also prescribe a brace that pushes down on the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> force them to stretch out their muscles.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems of high-heeled shoe design involves a properly constructed toe-box. Improper construction here can cause the most damage to one's foot. Toe-boxes that are too narrow force the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> be crammed too close together. Ensuring that room exists for the <b>toes</b> <b>to</b> assume a normal separation so that high-heel wear remains an option rather than a debilitating practice is an important issue in improving the wearability of high-heeled fashion shoes.|$|R

500|$|During Smith's 14 {{seasons with}} Stoke, he became {{known for his}} fearless mentality which led to him {{sustaining}} {{a large number of}} injuries. These included five broken legs, breaking his nose four times, a cracked ankle, broken collar bone, chipped spine, breaking most of his fingers and toes and needing more than 200 stitches. The sequence saw him named in the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football. Early into his career Smith soon developed a reputation as a [...] "hard player", who would launch himself at opponents determined to either block a shot and win the ball, which is how he picked up most of his injuries. He was known as Stoke's [...] "hitman", and relished going <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> toe with the biggest and most feared opposition players.|$|E
500|$|He {{has made}} sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, {{philosophers}} of the Scottish Enlightenment, which {{stand in the}} Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here I discovered that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot {{over the edge of}} the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E

50|$|Footjob is a (non-penetrative) sexual {{practice}} with the feet that involves one's feet being rubbed on a partner in order to induce sexual excitement, stimulation or orgasm. In some cases it {{can be part of}} a foot fetish.

500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And so now it is wonderful to see a woman on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see someone there who can stand <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 midterms.|$|E
500|$|New {{cast members}} include Ian McShane, {{who plays the}} notorious pirate and primary {{antagonist}} of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest. According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because [...] "he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well" [...] and the actor accepted the job due to both the [...] "very funny and charming" [...] script {{and the opportunity to}} work with Marshall. The beard took one {{hour and a half to}} get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to [...] "a real biker pirate—it's all black leather.” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as [...] "an actress who could not only go <b>toe</b> <b>to</b> toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way. She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful", and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine. The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow, and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip, and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast. Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and Juan Carlos Vellido. Jaenada was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz.|$|E
