5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches for dealing with <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken {{to do away with}} it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards <b>the</b> <b>militia.</b> After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Massachusetts <b>Militia</b> Law of 1840 brought {{significant}} changes to <b>the</b> Massachusetts <b>Militia.</b> <b>The</b> first change {{was that it}} drew a distinction between <b>the</b> enrolled <b>militia</b> and <b>the</b> volunteer <b>militia.</b> <b>The</b> enrolled <b>militia</b> was simply a list of able bodied men age 18 to 45 which would only be called upon in time of war.

5|$|Financially <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double the strength of <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and {{late in the year}} a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. <b>The</b> <b>Militia</b> is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, <b>the</b> <b>Militia</b> has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. <b>The</b> <b>Militia</b> often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston.

As the British party arrived, they came under fire from <b>the</b> <b>militia.</b> <b>The</b> <b>militia</b> set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of hay, and prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> men in the forest. <b>The</b> <b>militia</b> pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. <b>The</b> <b>militia</b> retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, 1832, <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> {{caught up}} with Black Hawk's band as they {{attempted}} to cross the Wisconsin River, near present-day Roxbury, in Dane County, near Sauk City, Wisconsin.

According to Dodge's account, before <b>the</b> <b>militia</b> met {{the main body of}} Black Hawk's band, three U.S. scouts crossed a small band of Sauk or Fox warriors and pursued them to within a mile of their camp. Scouts also killed two Sauk warriors before the real battle began.|$|E
25|$|Intending to {{give the}} {{appearance}} of Native American aggression, <b>the</b> <b>militia's</b> plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During <b>the</b> <b>militia's</b> first assault on the wagon train the emigrants fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among <b>the</b> <b>militia's</b> leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants.|$|R

5|$|Arriving in New Marais, Cole and {{his allies}} learn that energy magnate Joseph Bertrand III (Graham McTavish), an anti-Conduit demagogue, has seized control of the city.

While working to free her, Cole and Zeke meet Roscoe Laroche, a Vietnam veteran who leads a resistance movement opposed to Bertrand, and Nix (Nika Futterman), a shadow-manipulating Conduit who has been waging war on <b>the</b> <b>Militia.</b> Using intelligence gathered by Zeke, Cole and Nix locate a secret lab where Kuo, revealed to be a Conduit, {{has been forced to}} transfer her ice-generating powers to an army of human mercenaries controlled by Bertrand.
